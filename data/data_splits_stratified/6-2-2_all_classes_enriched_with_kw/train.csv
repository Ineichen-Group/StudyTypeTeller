1,31563227,Neurologic clinics,Vestibular Migraine.,"The term vestibular migraine designates recurrent vertigo that is caused by migraine. Vestibular migraine presents with episodes of spontaneous or positional vertigo lasting seconds to days that are accompanied by migraine symptoms. Because headache is often absent during acute attacks, other migraine features have to be identified by thorough history taking. In contrast, vestibular testing serves mainly for the exclusion of other diagnoses. Treatment still lacks solid evidence. It is targeted at the underlying migraine and comprises explanation and reassurance, lifestyle modifications, and drugs.",Dizziness| Migraine| Vertigo| Vestibular| Vestibular migraine,Non-systematic-review,1,0
2,3565056,Acta psychiatrica Belgica,Cognitive-behavioral models of depression.,"As suggested by the label itself, a cognitive-behavioral approach resulted from a mixture of a behavioristic and a cognitive model. Whereas the two models were originally quite distinct, the phenomenon of depression became a sort of meeting ground for both. While research has provided supportive evidence for both conceptualizations, recent research in cognitive psychology, especially the findings on mood and memory, might offer a broader framework to conceptualize depression as a multidimensional phenomenon.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
3,25182407,Developmental period medicine,[Influence of smoking intoxicants on dental status. Literature search and own experience].,"Amphetamines are phenylpropane derivatives belonging to the group of psychostimulating substances. Within the space of years, on account of their stimulating properties, they were used as treatment substances, e.g. in Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), in obesity as slimming substances, in preventing of paroxysmal drowsiness, as dilating bronchi substances, used as some dope in sports and willingly abused among drug addicts because of long lasting exciting euphoria after use. Methamphetamine, an amphetamine derivative, has even stronger and longer lasting effect. The study presents characteristics of a popular, among teenagers, addictive substance - amphetamine and its derivative- methamphetamine and its influence on teeth after using it in a smoking form. The condition of oral cavity of a 17-year-old patient, who has been using methamphetamine in a smoking form for about 3 years, was described. In the oral cavity of the patient numerous and extensive caries lesions were noticed, placed mainly in the labial cervical area of teeth as well as, a considerable damage of teeth's crowns and teeth loss. The patient needed complex dental treatment: conservative, endodontic, surgical and prosthetic. The use of intoxicating substances, derivatives of amphetamine in form of regular smoking caused a considerable damage of tooth tissues, leading to their loss.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

5,15935199,Primary care,Sleep in patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.,"Given the widely recognized association between many neurologic and psychiatric disorders and significant sleep disturbances, the International Classification of Sleep Disorders Diagnostic and Coding Manual recognizes 'Sleep Disorders Associated with Mental, Neurologic, or Other Medical Disorders' as one of four major classification categories. Such sleep disturbances may exacerbate symptoms of the underlying neurologic or psychiatric disorder or produce further adverse medical, behavioral, or psychosocial consequences. Therefore, adequate assessment and recognition of sleep disturbances in these populations is essential. This article includes a summary of neurologic systems influencing sleep that may be affected by neurologic and psychiatric disorders, followed by a brief review of sleep disturbances associated with many common neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
6,36601776,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,The central role of peripheral inflammation in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke pathology and its treatments conventionally focus on the brain. Probing inflammation, a critical secondary cell death mechanism in stroke, has been largely relegated to the brain. To this end, peripheral inflammation has emerged as an equally potent contributor to the onset and progression of stroke secondary cell death. Here, we review novel concepts on peripheral organs displaying robust inflammatory response to stroke. These inflammation-plagued organs include the spleen, cervical lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, gastrointestinal system, and adrenal glands, likely converging their inflammatory effects through B and T-cells. Recognizing the significant impact of this systemic inflammation, we also discuss innovative stroke therapeutics directed at sequestration of peripheral inflammation. This review paper challenges the paradigm of a brain-centered disease pathology and treatment and offers a peripheral approach to our stroke understanding.",Neuroinflammation| peripheral inflammation| regenerative medicine| stem cells| stroke,Non-systematic-review,1,0

8,20573052,Psychiatry and clinical neurosciences,Case for and against specificity of depression in Alzheimer's disease.,"The aims of this study were to assess the epidemiological, phenomenological, and pathophysiological evidence that suggests the specificity of depression associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD).	We reviewed the English-language literature.	Depression occurs significantly more often in patients with AD than in the general elderly population. While development of depression in response to the disability and emotional stress of AD may be a contributory factor in some patients, several studies showed that depression was not, or was only seldom, related to self-awareness of AD and these studies could not explain the high prevalence figures. To overcome the overlapping phenomenology of the two diseases, specific diagnostic criteria have been developed for depression in this context. Mixed findings have come from neuropathological and neuroimaging studies, with some evidence linking the underlying neural substrate of AD and depression, suggesting an overlapping cause of primary depression and depression comorbid with AD. Few randomized controlled trials for depression associated with AD have been conducted, with rather poor results for the use of antidepressants.	Currently, depression associated with AD is not considered a separate disorder by regulatory authorities and is unlikely to be considered as such in the near future. Several obstacles remain to support such a specific position, including the heterogenous nature of depression in general and within AD itself, the lack of a distinct set of symptoms, and limited treatment.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

In the sense of a bottom-up approach, a content analysis of problem-oriented interviews with 32 caregivers of patients with bipolar disorder was carried out. Additionally, the relevant literature identified by means of a computerized MEDLINE research on the years 1997 - 2007 with the key words 'caregiver'/'relative', 'burden' and 'bipolar disorder', was analysed to describe the situation of the caregivers comprehensively. Related articles in the MEDLINE search were also viewed.	The burden of relatives of bipolar patients are manifold and partially specific. On the top of the list caregivers mentioned emotional burdens like: 'lack of understanding, helplessness and hopelessness' (90,6 %) and 'own concernment' (81,2 %). Specific burdens of these caregivers are 'repulsing and uncooperative behaviour of the patient' (78,1 %) and 'burdens due to the alternation between manic and depressive symptoms' (71,9 %). The manic and depressive symptomatic complex were assessed as burden with equal frequency (75,0 %).

11,23747017,The Canadian journal of cardiology,Adopting the new anticoagulants: all aboard or all in good time?,"At last there is now more than 1 oral anticoagulant (OAC) available for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation. Though more choice is a good thing, it does mandate knowing which drug is the most appropriate in a given clinical situation. Three novel OACs--dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban--are approved for use in atrial fibrillation in Canada. They have each been evaluated in large, randomized controlled trials where they have been shown to be noninferior, or in some cases superior, to warfarin (Coumadin). Prescription coverage for these drugs is increasingly available through third party and government drug plans. The major enhancements of the novel OACs relate to their rapid, consistent anticoagulant effect at fixed dosing and the lack of need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect. Nonetheless, their use is not foolproof and practitioners must be familiar with their limitations. On balance, we favour the use of novel OACs over warfarin in patients who are anticoagulant-naive, given their increased ease of use. However, we advocate switching from warfarin only if international normalized ratio control has been poor or if frequent monitoring is problematic.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This has been known since Dr. Alois Alzheimer's first case, Frau Auguste D., presented with emotional distress and delusions of infidelity/excessive jealousy, followed by cognitive symptoms. Being cognizant of this, in 2010 the Alzheimer's Association convened a research roundtable on the topic of NPS in AD.

13,34360586,International journal of molecular sciences,"Copper, Iron, and Manganese Toxicity in Neuropsychiatric Conditions.","Copper, manganese, and iron are vital elements required for the appropriate development and the general preservation of good health. Additionally, these essential metals play key roles in ensuring proper brain development and function. They also play vital roles in the central nervous system as significant cofactors for several enzymes, including the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and other enzymes that take part in the creation and breakdown of neurotransmitters in the brain. An imbalance in the levels of these metals weakens the structural, regulatory, and catalytic roles of different enzymes, proteins, receptors, and transporters and is known to provoke the development of various neurological conditions through different mechanisms, such as via induction of oxidative stress, increased α-synuclein aggregation and fibril formation, and stimulation of microglial cells, thus resulting in inflammation and reduced production of metalloproteins. In the present review, the authors focus on neurological disorders with psychiatric signs associated with copper, iron, and manganese excess and the diagnosis and potential treatment of such disorders. In our review, we described diseases related to these metals, such as aceruloplasminaemia, neuroferritinopathy, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) and other very rare classical NBIA forms, manganism, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), ephedrone encephalopathy, HMNDYT1-SLC30A10 deficiency (HMNDYT1), HMNDYT2-SLC39A14 deficiency, CDG2N-SLC39A8 deficiency, hepatic encephalopathy, prion disease and 'prion-like disease', amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Friedreich's ataxia, and depression.",copper| iron| manganese| neurodegeneration,Non-systematic-review,1,0

15,31705515,Advances in experimental medicine and biology,"Digital Interventions for Mental Disorders: Key Features, Efficacy, and Potential for Artificial Intelligence Applications.","Mental disorders are highly prevalent and often remain untreated. Many limitations of conventional face-to-face psychological interventions could potentially be overcome through Internet-based and mobile-based interventions (IMIs). This chapter introduces core features of IMIs, describes areas of application, presents evidence on the efficacy of IMIs as well as potential effect mechanisms, and delineates how Artificial Intelligence combined with IMIs may improve current practices in the prevention and treatment of mental disorders in adults. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials clearly show that therapist-guided IMIs can be highly effective for a broad range of mental health problems. Whether the effects of unguided IMIs are also clinically relevant, particularly under routine care conditions, is less clear. First studies on IMIs for the prevention of mental disorders have shown promising results. Despite limitations and challenges, IMIs are increasingly implemented into routine care worldwide. IMIs are also well suited for applications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, which provides ample opportunities to improve the identification and treatment of mental disorders. Together with methodological innovations, these approaches may also deepen our understanding of how psychological interventions work, and why. Ethical and professional restraints as well as potential contraindications of IMIs, however, should also be considered. In sum, IMIs have a high potential for improving the prevention and treatment of mental health disorders across various indications, settings, and populations. Therefore, implementing IMIs into routine care as both adjunct and alternative to face-to-face treatment is highly desirable. Technological advancements may further enhance the variability and flexibility of IMIs, and thus even further increase their impact in people's lives in the future.",Artificial intelligence| Internet interventions| Machine learning| Mental disorders| Prevention| Psychotherapy| eHealth,Non-systematic-review,1,0
16,24737903,Postgraduate medical journal,Republished: Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides: is it time to split up the group?,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of diseases corresponding to necrotising inflammation of small vessels with a wide range of clinical presentations. At least two of the diseases are believed to exhibit a common ground of pathophysiological mechanisms. These are granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA). ANCA directed against proteinase 3 (PR3) are preferentially associated with GPA, and anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA are associated mainly with MPA and eosinophilic GPA (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome). Anti-MPO and anti-PR3 antibodies can activate neutrophils in vitro. In vivo data are available for humans and mice on the pathogenicity of anti-MPO but it is more controversial for PR3-ANCA. A recent genome-wide association study of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitides confirmed the genetic contribution to the pathogenesis of these conditions, with significant association of PR3-ANCA and human leukocyte antigen-DP and the genes encoding α1-antitrypsin and PR3. MPO-ANCA were significantly associated with human leukocyte antigen-DQ. Thus, recent results from epidemiological studies, genome-wide association study and therapeutic trials have suggested that these entities are, in fact, distinct. We have summarised these results and discuss the idea that these two entities should be studied separately as the nature of the two auto-antigens suggests at a molecular level despite shared ANCA involvement.",Autoantibodies| Granulomatosis with polyangiitis| Inflammation,Non-systematic-review,1,0

18,28257128,Nature reviews. Neurology,Cognitive decline in Parkinson disease,"Dementia is a frequent problem encountered in advanced stages of Parkinson disease (PD). In recent years, research has focused on the pre-dementia stages of cognitive impairment in PD, including mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Several longitudinal studies have shown that MCI is a harbinger of dementia in PD, although the course is variable, and stabilization of cognition - or even reversal to normal cognition - is not uncommon. In addition to limbic and cortical spread of Lewy pathology, several other mechanisms are likely to contribute to cognitive decline in PD, and a variety of biomarker studies, some using novel structural and functional imaging techniques, have documented in vivo brain changes associated with cognitive impairment. The evidence consistently suggests that low cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid-β(42), a marker of comorbid Alzheimer disease (AD), predict future cognitive decline and dementia in PD. Emerging genetic evidence indicates that in addition to the APOE*ε4 allele (an established risk factor for AD), GBA mutations and SCNA mutations and triplications are associated with cognitive decline in PD, whereas the findings are mixed for MAPT polymorphisms. Cognitive enhancing medications have some effect in PD dementia, but no convincing evidence that progression from MCI to dementia can be delayed or prevented is available, although cognitive training has shown promising results.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
19,35726540,"PM & R : the journal of injury, function, and rehabilitation",Preoperative electrodiagnostic planning for upper limb peripheral nerve transfers in cervical spinal cord injury: A narrative review.,"Peripheral nerve transfer (PNT) to improve upper limb function following cervical spinal cord injury (SCI) involves the transfer of supralesional donor nerves under voluntary control to intralesional or sublesional lower motor neurons not under voluntary control. Appropriate selection of donor and recipient nerves and surgical timing affect functional outcomes. Although the gold standard of nerve selection is intraoperative nerve stimulation, preoperative electrodiagnostic (EDX) evaluation may help guide surgical planning. Currently there is no standardized preoperative EDX protocol. This study reviews the EDX workup preceding PNT surgery in cervical SCI and proposes an informed EDX protocol to assist with surgical planning. The PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) framework was used to formulate relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and identify published cases of PNT in cervical SCI in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and Emcare databases in the last 10 years. The EDX techniques evaluating putative donor nerves, recipient nerve branches, time sensitivity of nerve transfer and other electrophysiological parameters were summarized to guide creation of a preoperative EDX protocol. Needle electromyography (EMG) was the most commonly used EDX technique to identify healthy donor nerves. Although needle EMG has also been used on recipient nerves, compound muscle action potential amplitudes may provide a more accurate determination of recipient nerve health and time sensitivity for nerve transfer. Although there has been progress in presurgical EDX evaluation, EMG and nerve conduction study approaches are variable, and each has limitations in their utility for preoperative planning. There is need for standardization in the EDX evaluation preceding PNT surgery to assist with donor and recipient nerve selection, surgical timing and to optimize outcomes. Based on results of this review, herein we propose the PreSCIse (PRotocol for Electrodiagnosis in SCI Surgery of the upper Extremity) preoperative EDX panel to achieve said goals through an interdisciplinary and patient-centered approach.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
20,16044216,Strahlentherapie und Onkologie : Organ der Deutschen Rontgengesellschaft ... [et al],Positron emission tomography for radiation treatment planning.,"To evaluate the impact of positron emission tomography (PET) on target volume delineation for radiation treatment planning.	The data of the literature concerning the use of PET in target volume delineation are summarized. The following points are discussed for each tumor entity: biological background for the PET investigation, sensitivity and specificity of PET (with different tracers) in comparison to computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and impact of PET on target volume definition. New PET tracers, which could visualize biological pathways, such as hypoxia, proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression patterns, will also be discussed.	The results of clinical studies on the integration of PET in target volume definition for lung, head-and-neck, genitourinary and brain tumors were analyzed. Fluorodeoxyglucose-(FDG-)PET has a significant impact on GTV (gross tumor volume) and PTV (planning target volume) delineation in lung cancer and can detect lymph node involvement and differentiate malignant tissue from atelectasis. In head-and-neck cancer, the value of FDG-PET for radiation treatment planning is still under investigation. For example, FDG-PET could be superior to CT and MRI in the detection of lymph node metastases and unknown primary cancer and in the differentiation of viable tumor tissue after treatment. Therefore, it might play an important role in GTV definition and sparing of normal tissue. Choline PET and acetate PET are promising tracers in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, but their validity in local tumor demarcation, lymph node diagnosis and detection of recurrence has to be defined in future clinical trials. FDG-PET seems to be particularly valuable in lymph node status definition in cervical cancer. In high-grade gliomas and meningiomas, methionine PET helps to define the GTV and differentiate tumor from normal tissue. For other entities like gastrointestinal cancer, lymphomas, sarcomas, etc., the data of the literature are yet insufficient. The imaging of hypoxia, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, apoptosis and gene expression leads to the identification of different areas of a biologically heterogeneous tumor mass that can individually be targeted using intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). In addition, a biological dose distribution can be generated, the socalled dose painting. However, systematic experimental and clinical trials are necessary to validate this hypothesis.	Regarding treatment planning in radiotherapy, PET offers advantages in terms of tumor delineation and the description of biological processes. To define the real impact of this investigation in radiation treatment planning, subsequent experimental, clinical and cost-benefit analyses are required.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

In early 2020, we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real and/or perceived lack of resources due to COVID-19. Although panic buying has a long history, there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon. During the early days of COVID-19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty. These negative emotions were, in part, a response to a real shortage of basic supplies. However, the panic response led to behaviors that, for some individuals, resulted in atypical buying patterns. From a therapeutic perspective, one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions, and how this impacts the associated behaviors. This article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions. By providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying, authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect.",COVID-19| interventions| panic buying| psychodynamic| psychological understanding,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Drawing from a growing, but limited, literature on the topic, we outline a process map for identifying and troubleshooting barriers to care in this at-risk population.	Young adults with ADHD frequently lack the organizational skills, time management, prioritization, and persistence to manage their health care at an expected level of adult independence. These difficulties are compounded by a health-care system that has less time or fewer resources for supporting young adult patients.	Recommendations for easing the transition from pediatric to adult care for late adolescents with ADHD include heavily leveraging the doctor-patient relationship, and capturing the young adult's attention through technologies that already absorb them.",ADHD| adolescence| attention-deficit| transition| transitional services,Non-systematic-review,1,0
25,16268859,Journal of advanced nursing,Agitation in dementia: concept clarification.,"The aim of this paper is to clarify the concept of agitation in dementia through analysing definitions, critical attributes, components, boundaries, antecedents and consequences of agitation.	The concept of agitation is not well defined. In addition, there exists much confusion about the characteristics and boundaries of agitation, as well as the distinction between agitation and related concepts. Recently developed theoretical models for agitation in dementia require new interpretation and conceptualization of agitation.	Morse's method of critical appraisal of the literature was used. In addition, some parts of Rodgers' evolutionary method were employed. Data were selected using six electronic databases and the key words 'agitation', 'agitated', 'dementia', 'demented' and 'Alzheimer'. The analysis included 86 empirical or theoretical papers and one book.	A transition from the observer's perspective to the patient's perspective in the interpretation of agitation was found. Five critical attributes of agitation in dementia were identified: excessive, inappropriate, repetitive, non-specific and observable. Patient factors, interpersonal factors, environmental factors and restraint were identified as precipitating antecedents. Mediating antecedents included discomfort, unmet need and misinterpretation. Consequences of agitation were identified at the levels of patient, caregiver and others.	This transition in perspectives has important implications as it can change health providers' attitudes and responses to agitation and lead to patient-focused and individualized care. Researchers and clinicians are encouraged to avoid labelling agitated behaviour as 'disturbing behaviour'.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Prospective observational studies have demonstrated histological changes after the use of pulsed CO2 laser vaginally in atrophic conditions. Increased collagen and extracellular matrix production has been reported together with an increase in the thickness of the vaginal epithelium with the formation of new papilla.

27,31196824,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Social cognition and psychopathology in childhood and adolescence,"There is a substantial body of research on social cognition in adults with epilepsy, and in broad categories such as focal and generalized epilepsies, but much less has been written about social cognition in children with epilepsy (CWE), and in childhood-onset epilepsy syndromes specifically. In several of these syndromes, autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), two disorders with social cognitive impairments, are reported. There is strong evidence for social cognitive deficits in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME). There is also a considerable amount of evidence for such deficits in a number of syndromes that may be associated with ASD or ADHD, including West syndrome (WS), Dravet syndrome (DS), and the Landau-Kleffner syndrome (LKS). However, the evidence is of variable quality and incomplete across the range of childhood epilepsy syndromes. In some syndromes, childhood epilepsy substantially increases the risk of severe social cognitive impairment, which may persist after the seizures remit. This paper presents an overview of current research on social cognition in childhood epilepsy, with a particular focus on syndromes with a high prevalence of autistic and behavioral comorbidities. Social cognitive impairments represent a considerable additional challenge for patients and caregivers. Early diagnosis and intervention might significantly improve long-term social cognitive outcomes, highlighting the need for greater awareness among clinicians of this important topic.

28,21180303,Indian heart journal,Safety and tolerability of beta-blockers: prejudices & reality.,"Beta-blockers (BB) substantially improve survival in chronic heart failure and after myocardial infarction. However, concern about side-effects may deter clinicians from prescribing these life-saving drugs. In reality, absolute contraindications are rare. Only 3-5% of patients are intolerant because of hypotension or bradycardia. Data from randomized controlled trials and retrospective studies show that most patients eligible to receive BB tolerate them well. BB are not contraindicated in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); in fact, these patients also benefit because of their high cardiovascular risk. In patients with COPD, as in the elderly, BB should be started at a low dose and uptitrated slowly. Monitoring of lung function during initiation is important, as undiagnosed coexistent asthma could be revealed. When patients are unaware of the drug in use, erectile dysfunction (ED) is reported no more often with BB than with any other drug prescribed for heart failure or hypertension. However, when patients are aware of the potential side-effects of BB, the resultant anxiety may cause ED. Patients should be reassured that BB prolong life and in the great majority are not the cause of ED, which may rather be related to the underlying disease (diabetes, hypertension, and atherosclerosis).",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
29,16401854,Neurology,Cardiac encephalopathy and congestive heart failure: a hypothesis about the relationship,"Many patients with congestive heart failure develop neurologic dysfunction. This may take the form of a cardiac encephalopathy that shares clinical features with other metabolic encephalopathies. The causes are multiple. There is a particular, previously unreported, syndrome that occasionally develops in some patients with congestive heart failure that resembles the findings in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus. This syndrome is characterized by apathy and abulia with preserved alertness; it is caused by fluid retention within the cranial cavity. The syndrome may also develop in patients with other conditions that cause anasarca, e.g., severe liver or kidney disease or hypoalbuminemia. Because patients with these conditions are often quite ill, it has been difficult to verify the pathophysiologic aspects of the syndrome so that its mechanism must remain a hypothesis that awaits more definitive study in a series of patients.

A number of known factors are etiologically relevant to each symptom, and it is likely that others remain to be discovered. Both enuresis and encopresis are truly psychosomatic entities, in which psychosocial and physiologic elements act and react with one another in the development and maintenance of the problem. Further research, emphasizing concurrent psychological and biologic evaluation, is needed to answer the many still remaining questions about the etiology, natural course, and treatment of these common childhood symptoms. Psychiatrists should be available as consultants to colleagues in primary care during the evaluation of enuretic and encopretic children and should be ready to treat a subgroup of symptomatic children who have identifiable psychopathology.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
31,9919465,Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia,The implications of hypothermia for early tracheal extubation following cardiac surgery.,"Thermoregulation is impaired during anesthesia for cardiac surgery. Redistribution of body heat and heat loss to the environment result in mild hypothermia before cardiopulmonary bypass. Maintenance of normothermia, rather than hypothermia, may facilitate early tracheal extubation. Hypothermia alters the distribution and decreases the metabolism of most drugs, including anesthetic drugs and muscle relaxants, thus prolonging recovery. Postoperative shivering increases metabolic rate and potentially leads to myocardial ischemia; prevention is therefore critical to the success of early tracheal extubation after cardiac surgery. Coagulopathies, increased incidence of surgical wound infection, and perioperative cardiac morbidity are other potential risk factors identified in noncardiac patients. Hypothermia, however, does have potential benefits to the patient, including protection from cerebral ischemia and hypoxemia. Mild core hypothermia (approximately 34 degrees C) may represent the optimal balance between risks and benefits for fast-track patients.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
32,34939171,Neurotherapeutics : the journal of the American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics,Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI),"Vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is predominately caused by vascular risk factors and cerebrovascular disease. VCI includes a broad spectrum of cognitive disorders, from mild cognitive impairment to vascular dementia caused by ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, and vascular factors alone or in a combination with neurodegeneration including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and AD-related dementia. VCI accounts for at least 20-40% of all dementia diagnosis. Growing evidence indicates that cerebrovascular pathology is the most important contributor to dementia, with additive or synergistic interactions with neurodegenerative pathology. The most common underlying mechanism of VCI is chronic age-related dysregulation of CBF, although other factors such as inflammation and cardiovascular dysfunction play a role. Vascular risk factors are prevalent in VCI and if measured in midlife they predict cognitive impairment and dementia in later life. Particularly, hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking at midlife are each associated with a 20 to 40% increased risk of dementia. Control of these risk factors including multimodality strategies with an inclusion of lifestyle modification is the most promising strategy for treatment and prevention of VCI. In this review, we present recent developments in age-related VCI, its mechanisms, diagnostic criteria, neuroimaging correlates, vascular risk determinants, and current intervention strategies for prevention and treatment of VCI. We have also summarized the most recent and relevant literature in the field of VCI.",Biomarkers| Cognition| Neuroimaging| Small vessel disease| Vascular cognitive impairment| Vascular risk factors,Non-systematic-review,1,0

In the quest for elucidating the neurobiological basis of MDD, hippocampal neurogenesis has emerged as a candidate substrate, both for the etiology as well as treatment of MDD. This chapter critiques the advances made in the study of hippocampal neurogenesis as they relate to the neurogenic hypothesis of MDD. While an involvement of neurogenesis in the etiology of depression remains highly speculative, preclinical studies have revealed a novel and previously unrecognized role for hippocampal neurogenesis in mediating some of the behavioral effects of antidepressants.

The resulting visual impairment can be debilitating for patients, impeding daily activities such as reading and mobility. Historically, it was believed that there was little opportunity for restoration of function following visual system damage. However, the development of various visual rehabilitative strategies suggests that visual field defects are partially repairable and a certain degree of function can be improved. While this provides hope for patients, many of these strategies have been met with skepticism within the clinical and scientific communities. Further development of these strategies through carefully designed studies could validate their efficacy and reveal underlying mechanisms.

The Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) pathway is a major innate immune pathway activated acutely and chronically after stroke. Hence, understanding the intricacies of the temporal profile, specific control points, and cellular specificity of TLR4 activation is crucial for the development of any novel therapeutics targeting the endogenous innate immune response after focal cerebral ischemia. The goal of this review is to summarize the current findings related to TLR4 signaling after stroke with a specific focus on the components of the neurovascular unit such as astrocytes, neurons, endothelial cells, and pericytes. In addition, this review will examine the effects of focal cerebral ischemia on interaction of these neurovascular unit components.",Focal cerebral ischemia| Innate immunity| Neurovascular unit| TLR4| Toll-like receptor,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This article reviews the clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension.	The hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache; however, clinical presentations can be heterogeneous. New evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis. Some patients may have normal opening pressure, which suggests that insufficiency of CSF volume (hypovolemia) rather than CSF pressure might be the underlying mechanism. Several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the CSF leakage, including brain MRI, spinal MRI, CT myelography, digital subtraction myelography, and radionuclide cisternography. Complications, such as subdural hematoma, can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially life-threatening consequences. Conservative treatments, such as fluid supplementation, can provide temporary relief; however, epidural blood patches, especially targeted ones, are more effective and definitive. For patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension, surgical repair of spinal CSF leakages should be considered.	Brain and spinal MRIs are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Early treatment with epidural blood patches may be considered to shorten the disease duration and minimize the potential risk of complications.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

There is, however, a paucity of research on cognitive functions in this population.	In a review of the literature, a total of 17 articles that described cognitive outcome in adult PCNSL patients were identified.	The studies that assessed cognitive functions after whole-brain radiotherapy combined with chemotherapy reported cognitive impairment in most patients. Patients treated with chemotherapy alone had either stable or improved cognitive performance in most studies. Methodological problems, however, limited the ability to ascertain the specific contribution of disease and various treatment interventions to cognitive outcome. On the basis of the literature review, a battery of cognitive and quality-of-life (QoL) measures to be used in prospective clinical trials was proposed. The battery is composed of five standardized neuropsychological tests, covering four domains sensitive to disease and treatment effects (attention, executive functions, memory, psychomotor speed), and QoL questionnaires, and meets criteria for use in collaborative trials.	The incorporation of formal and systematic cognitive evaluations in PCNSL studies will improve our understanding of treatment-related neurotoxicity in this population.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
39,12395691,Psychopharmacology bulletin,Comparing the methods used to compare antidepressants.,"A wide array of antidepressants are now available to treat depression. However, the conventional wisdom that these medications are equally effective may not be true. It is argued that most randomized controlled trials (RCTs) do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication. Until RCTs that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted, or more sensitive research designs are developed, it will be difficult to determine if a 'not statistically different' finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a false-negative result (or type II error). Statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies. The relative merits and limitations of quantitative meta-analysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed. The former method is preferred when a large number of relevant RCTs can be analyzed. Beyond the number of studies, publication bias ('file drawer' effect) and study selection criteria may influence outcomes of meta-analysis. Pooled analysis, which combines all original patient data, is preferred when there are only a handful of related RCTs. However, the integrity of a pooled analysis can be ruined by selective inclusion of studies ('cherry picking'). The validity of combining the data from different studies also must be demonstrated. Results of studies using these complementary methods suggest that there may be clinically meaningful differences in efficacy between several classes of antidepressants.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Here, we report an extremely rare cause of foot drop in a child, which if not recognized early, could lead to multiple complications.	A 6-year-old girl presented with difficulty in walking and left sided foot droop for1-month duration. On examination she had reduced muscle power in dorsiflexors and plantar flexors and diminished knee and absent ankle jerk in the left side. Sensory loss was noted in L4 and L5 dermatomes on the left side. Superficial abdominal reflex was absent on the left side while preserved in the right. Nerve conduction and electromyography revealed nerve root or spinal cord cause for the foot drop. These results prompted ordering MRI spine and brain which revealed Chiari malformation type-1 with holocord syrinx extending from the cervicomedullary junction to conus medullaris.	This case highlights the importance of considering broad differential diagnosis for foot drop and value of the complete neurological examination including superficial reflexes in arriving at a diagnosis.

Due to the complexity and heterogeneity of ASD and lack of a proper human cellular model system, the pathophysiological mechanism of ASD during the developmental process is largely unknown. However, recent progress in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology as well as in vitro neural differentiation techniques have allowed us to functionally characterize neurons and analyze cortical development during neural differentiation. These technical advances will increase our understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of heterogeneous ASD and help identify molecular biomarkers for patient stratification as well as personalized medicine. In this review, we summarize our current knowledge of iPSC generation, differentiation of specific neuronal subtypes from iPSCs, and phenotypic characterizations of human ASD patient-derived iPSC models. Finally, we discuss the current limitations of iPSC technology and future directions of ASD pathophysiology studies using iPSCs.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
42,11905606,The Lancet. Oncology,The seed and soil hypothesis: vascularisation and brain metastases.,"The development of a relevant mouse model for the establishment and growth of brain metastases is essential for study of the biology and therapy of brain metastasis. Injection of human tumour cells into the internal carotid artery of syngeneic or nude mice produces experimental metastases in specific regions of the brain; these are not due to patterns of initial cell arrest, motility, or invasiveness, but rather to the ability of metastatic tumour cells to grow. Whether the progressive growth of brain metastases depends on neovascularisation is not clear. Immunohistochemical and morphometric analyses show that the density of blood vessels within experimental metastases in the brains of nude mice, or within brain metastases derived from human lung cancer, is lower than in the adjacent, tumour-free brain parenchyma. However, blood vessels associated with brain metastases are dilated and contain many dividing endothelial cells. Immunohistochemical analysis also reveals that tumour cells located less than 100 microm from a blood vessel are viable, whereas more distant tumour cells undergo apoptosis. The blood-brain barrier is intact in and around experimental brain metastases smaller than 0.25 mm in diameter, but is leaky in larger metastases. Nevertheless, the lesions are resistant to chemotherapeutic drugs. The way in which the brain microenvironment influences the biological behaviour of tumour cells is a subject of intense investigation.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

While the former is caused by rare, highly penetrant, and pathogenic mutations, risk for sporadic ALS is probably the result of the combined effects of common polymorphisms with minor to moderate effect sizes. Owing to recent advances in high-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies, genetic research in both fields is evolving at a rapidly increasing pace making it more and more difficult to follow and evaluate the most significant progress in the field. To alleviate this problem, our groups have created dedicated and freely available online databases, ALSoD (http://alsod.iop.kcl.ac.uk/) and ALSGene (http://www.alsgene.org), which provide systematic and in-depth qualitative and quantitative overviews of genetic research in both familial and sporadic ALS.

44,19432386,Dialogues in clinical neuroscience,Multiple rare variants in the etiology of autism spectrum disorders.,"Recent studies in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) support an important role for multiple rare variants in these conditions. This is a clinically important finding, as, with the demonstration that a significant proportion of ASDs are the result of rare, etiological genetic variants, it becomes possible to make use of genetic testing to supplement behavioral analyses for an earlier diagnosis. As it appears that earlier interventions in ASDs will produce better outcomes, the development of genetic testing to augment behaviorally based evaluations in ASDs holds promise for improved treatment. Furthermore, these rare variants involve synaptic and neuronal genes that implicate specific pathways, cells, and subcellular compartments in ASDs, which in turn will suggest novel therapeutic approaches in ASDs. Of particular recent interest are the synaptic cell adhesion and associated molecules, including neurexin 1, neuroligin 3 and 4, and SHANK3, which implicate glutamatergic synapse abnormalities in ASDs. In the current review we will overview the evidence for a genetic etiology for ASDs, and summarize recent genetic findings in these disorders.	Los estudios recientes en los trastornos del espectro autista (TEA) refuerzan el importante papel que tienen múltiples variantes raras en estos cuadros. Este es un hallazgo clínicamente importante, ya que con la demostración de que un porcentaje significativo de TEA son el resultado de una etiología de varían-tes genéticas raras, puede llegar a ser posible el empleo de pruebas genéticas como complemento al análisis de la conducta para un diagnóstico más precoz. Ya que se ha observado que las intervenciones más precoces en los TEA generan mejores evoluciones, el desarrollo de pruebas genéticas complementarías a las evaluaciones basadas en la conducta en los TEA promete un mejor tratamiento. Además estas variantes raras comprenden genes sinápticos y neuronales que incluyen vías específicas, células y compartimentos subcelulares en los TEA, lo que a la vez sugiere nuevas aproximaciones terapéuticas en los TEA, Recientemente ha tenido un especial interés la adhesión celular sináptica y las moléculas asociadas, que incluyen la neurexína 1, las neurolígínas 3 y 4, y SHANK3 lo que se traduce en alteraciones de la sínapsís glutamatérgíca en los TEA, En este artículo se revisa la evidencia de la etiología genética para los TEA y se resumen los hallazgos genéticos recientes en estos trastornos.

45,2420691,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,[Aphasia in children].,"The acquired aphasia in children is a rarely seen speech and language disorders. Disturbances develop after the child has already achieved the capacity for language comprehension and verbal expression. Brain trauma is most often the cause. The clinical picture of the disorder varies over different age groups and, in contrast to adults, shows no consistent typology. In most of the cases there exists a disturbance of speech production; problems with writing and comprehension are seen less often (although comprehension of language is primarily affected in the Landau-Kleffner syndrome). Only once and a while logorrhoea and jargon can be diagnosed. Besides the speech and language disorders cognitive, motor und emotional problems may appear. Therefore, several diagnostic levels have to be considered (e.g. clinical neurology, neuropsychology, psychophysiology, psychopathology). Course and prognosis of the acquired aphasia in childhood (30% longterm difficulties) depend on several factors like etiology and extension of the lesion, the development of the functional hemispheric dominance for language and the initial recovery velocity after the symptoms appeared. The plasticity of the child's brain is a source for compensating mechanisms which might be triggered by three aspects of therapeutic activities which should be used synchronously: speech and language training, principles of psychotherapy and social medicine and treatment of additional disorders.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

We describe the processes and challenges involved in restructuring how services and care are delivered to youth (11-25 years old) with mental health needs based on the objectives of the pan-Canadian ACCESS Open Minds network.	We provide a narrative review of how youth mental health services have developed since our engagement with the ACCESS Open Minds initiative, based on its five central objectives of early identification, rapid access, appropriate care, continuity of care, and youth and family engagement.	Building on an initial community mapping exercise, a service network has been developed; teams that were previously age-oriented have been integrated together to seamlessly cover the age 11 to 25 range; early identification has thus far focused on high-school populations; and an actual drop-in space facilitates rapid access and linkages to appropriate care within the 30-day benchmark.	Initial aspects of the transformation have relied on restructuring and partnerships that have generated early successes. However, further transformation over the longer term will depend on data demonstrating how this has impacted clinical outcomes and service utilization. Ultimately, sustainability in a large urban centre will likely involve scaling up to a network of similar services to cover the entire population of the city.",Canada| access| case identification| service transformation| youth mental health,Non-systematic-review,1,0

While the mammalian central nervous system (CNS) expresses AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8, the lack of SLC6A8 in astrocytes around the blood-brain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery, and suggests that the CNS has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through AGAT and GAMT expression. This seems contradictory with SLC6A8 deficiency, which, despite AGAT and GAMT expression, also leads to creatine deficiency in the CNS. We present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter, AGAT and GAMT are expressed in a dissociated way: e.g. only a few cells co-express both genes. This suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the CNS, at least for a significant part of it, guanidinoacetate must be transported from AGAT- to GAMT-expressing cells, possibly through SLC6A8. This would explain the creatine deficiency observed in SLC6A8-deficient patients. By bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes, AGAT, GAMT and SLC6A8 distribution in CNS, as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain, this review presents a comprehensive framework, including new hypotheses, on brain creatine metabolism and transport, both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

One end of this spectrum is represented by the employment of simple fetishes introduced into a sexual scene in order to promote sexual arousal. Moving along the continuum, one encounters increasing complex behavioral patterns including the enactment of scripts that actualize one's perverse fantasies, including the assumption of complementary roles (e.g. sadomasochism) that equally serve the needs, and represent the desires, of both parties involved. A unique clinical entity, 'perverse modes of relatedness,' lies on the extreme end of the spectrum, representing the reification of the relationship as it becomes little more than a vehicle to take possession and control one's object for the gratification of one's sole needs and desires. What each of these phenomena share in common is both the insertion of a thing or condition - ranging from a simple fetishistic object to an elaborate style of relating that reduces the other into pawn played upon the pervert's chessboard, between the two 'relating' objects as well as a less than honest relationship with reality.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

55,37248910,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Best Medicine for Dementia: The Life-Long Defense of the Brain,"This review deals with an unwelcome reality about several forms of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease- that these dementias are caused, in part or whole, by the aging of the vasculature. Since the vasculature ages in us all, dementia is our fate, sealed by the realit!ies of the circulation; it is not a disease with a cure pending. Empirically, cognitive impairment before our 7th decade is uncommon and considered early, while a diagnosis in our 11th decade is late but common in that cohort (>40%). Projections from earlier ages suggest that the prevalence of dementia in people surviving into their 12th decade exceeds 80%. We address the question why so few of many interventions known to delay dementia are recognized as therapy; and we try to resolve this few-and-many paradox, identifying opportunities for better treatment, especially pre-diagnosis. The idea of dementia as a fate is resisted, we argue, because it negates the hope of a cure. But the price of that hope is lost opportunity. An approach more in line with the evidence, and more likely to limit suffering, is to understand the damage that accumulates with age in the cerebral vasculature and therefore in the brain, and which eventually gives rise to cognitive symptoms in late life, too often leading to dementia. We argue that hope should be redirected to delaying that damage and with it the onset of cognitive loss; and, for each individual, it should be redirected to a life-long defense of their brain.",Alzheimer’s disease| cerebral vasculature| chronic traumatic encephalopathy| dementia| dementia pugilistica| traumatic brain injury,Non-systematic-review,1,0

57,16807870,Revista de neurologia,[A proposal for a clinical registry of dementias].,"We outline a proposal for the structural and functional features needed to develop a registry of dementias which can be used to collect standardised information that is both reliable and valid concerning cases of dementia in the specialised health care centres within a particular geographical area.	Due to the shortage of information about aspects concerning the impact of dementias on the health care system (in terms of the usage of resources and patterns of detection, referral, diagnosis and treatment in usual clinical practice in primary and secondary care), a sequential implementation of the registry is proposed so that it can be adapted to each health district or region. The first step is to identify the cases and sources of information; second, a system for collecting data must be developed that allows information to be gathered in a standardised manner while at the same time making it possible to work in close collaboration with the specialists who diagnose dementia; and, third, it must be set up with the logistics and staff needed to centralise all the functions and activities of the registry.	Epidemiological surveillance is an essential instrument for planning, managing and distributing community health resources, for following up the natural history of chronic diseases and for assessing the impact of programmes of prevention. In this respect, and from a functional point of view, the proposed registry of dementias meets all the basic requirements of epidemiological surveillance.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
58,21375489,Current molecular medicine,The Role of immune and inflammatory mechanisms in ALS.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disease. The cause is unknown, but genetic abnormalities have been identified in subjects with familial ALS and also in subjects with sporadic ALS. Environmental factors such as occupational exposure have been shown to be risk factors for the development of ALS. Patients differ in their clinical features and differ in the clinical course of disease. Immune abnormalities have been found in the central nervous system by pathological studies and also in the blood and CSF of subjects with ALS. Inflammation and immune abnormalities are also found in animals with a model of ALS due to mutations in the SOD1 gene. Previously it has been considered that immune abnormalities might contribute to the pathogenesis of disease. However more recently it has become apparent that an immune response can occur as a response to damage to the nervous system and this can be protective.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

The WNV natural cycle involves birds as the main amplifying hosts and several species of mosquito as vectors. Many outbreaks occurred during the past decade, causing severe human encephalitis in the Old World, and the virus has become established in many European countries. Emergence of WNV is difficult to predict and even more difficult to prevent. In this review, the latest information on the epidemiology, transmission dynamics and clinical aspects of WNV is presented, with particular focus on specific factors likely to trigger changes in the distribution of the disease in Europe, such as climate changes and their consequences on the potential vectors of WNV or bird migration routes. The control of some anthropogenic and environmental factors could help prevent extension and re-emergence of WNV epidemics.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

61,27469219,Current drug metabolism,Delivery of Nanoparticles for Treatment of Brain Tumor.,"Malignant brain tumor is a highly challenging disease for diagnosis, treatment, and management. Cytotoxicity, distribution and the ability to cross blood brain barrier are some of the most significant issues for the chemotherapy of brain tumors. Nanotechnology has been widely exploited in drug delivery with great potential in improving the drug efficiency and efficacy. The advent of nanotechnology would greatly facilitate the early detection and treatment of brain tumors. This review will be primarily focused on current nano drug delivery system for brain cancer therapy. Meanwhile, the existing impediments for therapeutic nanomedicines and critical analysis of the different delivery nanoparticles are also discussed.	We systematically evaluated the major factors that impact the current nanomedicines for brain tumor therapy. Meanwhile, various nanoparticle-based formulations for brain cancer detection and therapy are evaluated.	124 papers were included in this review. From the analysis of the nanomaterials, seven major nanomaterials have been discussed regarding the functionality and current therapeutic significance. The review also explains in detail about the different types of nanomaterials and their functionalities. This shows that each of these nanomaterials has specialized functions for the treatment of various kinds of brain cancer.	Nanomaterials provide a viable potential diagnosis mechanis. In the future, more research needs to be focused on developing a better diagnosis tool for detection of cancer on an urgent basis. Blood-brain barrier and cytotoxicity are some of the primary root causes for the impediment of treatment of cancer using nanoparticles. Therefore, different delivery systems should be exploited for the nanoparticles to surmount these issues.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

63,23027099,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,Epileptic encephalopathies in infants and children.,"The term epileptic encephalopathy is used to describe diffuse brain dysfunction that is caused, at least in part, by some aspect of epilepsy. Early-infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE), West syndrome, late infantile epileptic encephalopathy, and Lennox-Gastaut are four epilepsy syndromes. These epilepsies are also among the most severe with dire consequences including intractable seizures and severe cognitive dysfunction. These epilepsies share several important characteristics: diverse causes; severe and frequent seizures; diffusely abnormal background activity on electroencephalograms that is often profound; medical intractability; and severe consequences for a normal development. Ohtahara proposed that these epilepsies exist on an electroclinical spectrum and that the clinical and electroencephalogram features are dependent on the maturation of the nervous system. One can now add Late Infantile Epileptogenic Encephalopathy (LIEE) or epilepsy with late-onset of epileptic spasms. Recently, similar gene mutations have been found in several different epilepsy syndromes, reinforcing the notion that these epilepsies are not likely to be distinguished based on cause alone. Recognition and accurate classification of these severe epilepsies is important as the first step toward improving treatment and outcomes.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
64,6135252,Schizophrenia bulletin,Is there a tardive dysmentia?,"A change in the phenomenology of schizophrenia has been observed over the past several decades; affective disturbances and phasic courses have become more evident. Although there is no obvious single explanation for these changes, several ideas have been considered. The advent and use of antipsychotic drugs over the past 30 years stands out as the most significant change. Because it is well known that chronic treatment with antipsychotic drugs can induce tardive dyskinesia and has been hypothesized to induce a supersensitivity psychosis, it is reasonable to believe that other behavioral changes may occur over time. We here describe a behavioral disorder that we have termed tardive dysmentia, involving changes in affect, activation level, and interpersonal interaction. A relationship between tardive dysmentia and tardive dyskinesia is suggested. It is our hypothesis that tardive dysmentia contributes to the changing course of schizophrenia and occurs after long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

The image-based degree of stenosis in the carotid artery and the plaque burden can be predicted using the automated carotid lumen diameter (LD)/inter-adventitial diameter (IAD) measurements from B-mode ultrasound images. The objective of this review is to present the state-of-the-art methods and systems for the measurement of LD/IAD in CCA based on automated or semi-automated strategies. Further, the performance of these systems is compared based on various metrics for its measurements.	The automated algorithms proposed for the segmentation of carotid lumen are broadly classified into two different categories as: region-based and boundary-based. These techniques are discussed in detail specifying their pros and cons. Further, we discuss the challenges encountered in the segmentation process along with its quantitative assessment. Lastly, we present stenosis quantification and risk stratification strategies.	Even though, we have found more boundary-based approaches compared to region-based approaches in the literature, however, the region-based strategy yield more satisfactory performance. Novel risk stratification strategies are presented. On a patient database containing 203 patients, 9 patients are identified as high risk patients, whereas 27 patients are identified as medium risk patients.	We have presented different techniques for the lumen segmentation of the common carotid artery from B-mode ultrasound images and measurement of lumen diameter and inter-adventitial diameter. We believe that the issue regarding boundary-based techniques can be compensated by taking regional statistics embedded with boundary-based information.",B-mode ultrasound| Carotid artery| Inter-adventitial diameter| Lumen diameter| Measurement| Performance| Segmentation| Stenosis,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Available therapies are unable to treat all the symptoms, and result in strong side effects. For this reason, numerous animal models have been generated to elucidate the pathophysiology of this disorder. All these models present neuronal remodeling and abnormalities in spine stability. It is well known that the complexity in dendritic arborization determines the number of receptive synaptic contacts. Also the loss of dendritic spines and arbor stability are strongly associated with schizophrenia. This review evaluates changes in spine density and dendritic arborization in animal models of schizophrenia.

67,30059733,NeuroImage,Neonatal brain injury and aberrant connectivity.,"Brain injury sustained during the neonatal period may disrupt development of critical structural and functional connectivity networks leading to subsequent neurodevelopmental impairment in affected children. These networks can be characterized using structural (via diffusion MRI) and functional (via resting state-functional MRI) neuroimaging techniques. Advances in neuroimaging have led to expanded application of these approaches to study term- and prematurely-born infants, providing improved understanding of cerebral development and the deleterious effects of early brain injury. Across both modalities, neuroimaging data are conducive to analyses ranging from characterization of individual white matter tracts and/or resting state networks through advanced 'connectome-style' approaches capable of identifying highly connected network hubs and investigating metrics of network topology such as modularity and small-worldness. We begin this review by summarizing the literature detailing structural and functional connectivity findings in healthy term and preterm infants without brain injury during the postnatal period, including discussion of early connectome development. We then detail common forms of brain injury in term- and prematurely-born infants. In this context, we next review the emerging body of literature detailing studies employing diffusion MRI, resting state-functional MRI and other complementary neuroimaging modalities to characterize structural and functional connectivity development in infants with brain injury. We conclude by reviewing technical challenges associated with neonatal neuroimaging, highlighting those most relevant to studying infants with brain injury and emphasizing the need for further targeted study in this high-risk population.",Brain injury| Functional connectivity| Infant| Magnetic resonance imaging| Prematurity| Structural connectivity,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Psychopharmacotherapy has a crucial role in the treatment of this complex disorder and targets the respective core symptoms. It comprises basically atypical antipsychotics, antidepressant agents and moodstabilizers, often requiring a combination of these substances in case of complex, multidimensional symptoms. Regarding the predominantly young and female patients the teratogenic risk demands critical consideration. This study focuses on the use of moodstabilizers in the treatment of BPD and gives an overview of the currently available studies on this substance class, in particular on lithium, carbamazepine, divalproex sodium, topiramate and lamotrigine. Results show significant effects on core features of BPD, but nevertheless, there are considerable limits in comparability and validity among the studies because of heterogeneities in the patient groups, study design, additive medication and outcome measures. Disregarding the off-label use in this indication the data reflect however an established clinical practice of use for these substances and underline the pivotal impact of moodstabilizers in the treatment of core symptoms of BPD.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This framework is used to review literature from the past decade on access to health care and health promotion for persons with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). Review of the literature indicates an emerging evidence base for health promotion programs for persons with IDD. Research in health care and health promotion access requires improvements in surveillance and measurement of quality of life, as well as increased participation of persons with IDD and their families in its implementation. While international guidelines for primary health care have been developed for people with IDD, US guidelines are specialty focused and address specific conditions. Despite its recognized importance, there is surprisingly little information on training programs for health care providers to improve care of persons with IDD. Financing of health care continues to threaten access to comprehensive care for persons with IDD, particularly regarding coordination of care and availability of providers who accept Medicaid patients. Community-based sources of health care have been slow to emerge, and there is clear need for assumption of responsibility for providing care to persons with IDD. Future US policy should include consideration of environmental factors in health care access.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

These programs are currently being implemented throughout the United States and beyond. The purpose of this study is to review the literature and to generate an overview of strategies currently used to implement such models in daily practice.	Six overlapping strategies to implement collaborative primary care-mental health models were described in 18 selected studies. We identified interactive educational strategies, quality improvement change processes, technological support tools, stakeholder engagement in the design and execution of implementation plans, organizational changes in terms of expanding the task of nurses and financial strategies such as additional collaboration fees and pay for performance incentives.	Considering the overwhelming evidence about the effectiveness of primary care-mental health models, there is a lack of good studies focusing on their implementation strategies. In practice, these strategies are multifaceted and locally defined, as a result of intensive and required stakeholder engagement.

Recent breakthrough discoveries identifying common genes that are causal to either ALS or FTD or an overlapping ALS-FTD syndrome have dramatically transformed our view regarding their pathogenesis. Most recently, a massive hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansion mutation in C9orf72 gene has been linked to the majority of familial ALS, FTD and mixed ALS-FTD cases. C9orf72 and other genes causal to ALS and FTD are consistently associated with the formation of cellular RNA inclusions and protein aggregates.

However, the diagnosis of ADHD is delicate to establish and subject to several controversies regarding its etiopathological origins and, therefore, its treatment. In practice, those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder, no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children. It would therefore be simplistic to consider the ADHD as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment, only.

A critical review was performed of studies published either as articles or abstracts, on the use of novel antipsychotics, particularly as they relate to the patient population within the state mental hospital system.	The recent availability of new antipsychotic medications within state facilities has resulted in more progressive treatment, reduced recidivism (and consequently cost savings), and preliminary evidence of preferential and superior treatment response in specific patient subgroups (e.g., those with aggression). At the same time, inpatient pharmacy budget increases and uncertainty in guiding the use of novel antipsychotics have influenced the availability of these agents in state hospitals.

During the past 15 years, considerable research activity has focused on psychometrically identified individuals hypothesized to be en route to schizophrenia (i.e., putative schizotypes). The Perceptual Aberration Scale (PAS) has figured prominently in such prediction-oriented psychometric high-risk work. This report examines research using the PAS completed since 1987 that has established the instrument as a valid index for detecting liability for schizophrenia (or schizotypy) and as, arguably, the schizotypy index of choice for research. These results are presented and interpreted in light of Meehl's theoretical framework of schizotypy. Other measures of and assessment devices for schizotypy (schizophrenia-related liability) are identified. Of these other measures, the Chapmans' Magical Ideation Scale and the schizophrenia liability index of Moldin and colleagues are particularly well established. Methodologic suggestions for future psychometric high-risk and other work using objective measures of schizotypic psychopathology are offered. It is strongly recommended that future studies of schizotypy (or those in the planning stages, relying on psychometric detection methods use multiple psychometric indices to tap schizotypy or use a psychometric index in association with other promising biobehavioral markers of schizophrenia liability (e.g., sustained attentional deficits, eye movement dysfunction) for maximum efficiency in both location and definition of schizotypes.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

83,16146330,The AAPS journal,New questions regarding bioequivalence of levothyroxine preparations: a clinician's response.,"A recent decision by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to declare various brands of levothyroxine bioequivalent has provoked objections from several physicians' organizations. These organizations assert that the method of testing bioequivalence is flawed, and that indiscriminate switching among preparations could lead to serious instances of undertreatment and overtreatment of hypothyroid patients. In this review we first list common indications for thyroid hormone administration, distinguishing its use as replacement therapy in hypothyroidism from its use to suppress thyrotropin (TSH) secretion in cases of thyroid cancer, nodules, and goiter. The dangers associated with changing to a preparation with different bioavailability are summarized, noting the particular danger of giving a more active preparation to a patient receiving TSH-suppressive doses of levothyroxine. However, these dangers are part of a larger problem: there are data showing that large numbers of patients are already receiving an improper dosage of levothyroxine, as judged from measurements of serum TSH. The recent history of FDA actions concerning levothyroxine bioequivalence and the arguments of those in disagreement are summarized. The immediate response to these problems should be better education of both patients and physicians. It is also recommended that there be further discussion of the problems in determining bioequivalence, and that consideration be given to more accurate and clinically relevant methods. Such methods should include assessment of the changes in TSH induced by each preparation in athyrotic patients.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Here, we review the strengths and weaknesses of these epidemiological studies and possible neuroimmunological mechanisms.	Initial concerns of a 13-fold increased relative risk of narcolepsy were raised by the Scandinavian health protection agencies in 2010. Subsequent retrospective studies support these findings in Canada, France, Ireland, England and Denmark. The cases are predominantly young children who present with severe and rapid onset of cataplexy as well as narcolepsy often within a few weeks of vaccination. The proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibody-mediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility. However, there have not yet been any reports of specific autoimmunity, either antibody or T-cell-mediated.	There is a strong association between narcolepsy and H1N1 vaccination. However, whether this reflects a true increase in affected individuals or a hastening of disease onset in individuals who would otherwise have developed narcolepsy later will become clear in the coming years. The pathological explanation of this association and narcolepsy is likely to be autoimmune, although supportive evidence is lacking.Video abstract available: See the Video Supplementary Digital Content 1 (http://links.lww.com/COPM/A9).",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Meanwhile, the limited success of current treatments has led to a search for early markers of dementia which could predict future progression or improve quality of life for those already suffering from the disease. One focus has been on the correlation between physical and cognitive measures with an increasing interest in the association between frailty and cognitive decline. Frailty is an age-related syndrome described as the decreased ability of an organism to respond to stressors. A number of epidemiological studies have reported that frailty increases the risk of future cognitive decline and that cognitive impairment increases the risk of frailty suggesting that cognition and frailty interact within a cycle of decline associated with ageing. This paper reviews the evidence for an association between frailty and cognitive impairment and outlines some of the mechanisms that potentially underpin this relationship from brain neuropathology and hormonal dysregulation to cardiovascular risk and psychological factors.",Cognition| Cognitive impairment| Dementia| Frailty,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This review investigated the ubiquitin-proteasome system, lysosome-associated degradation, endoplasmic-reticulum-associated degradation, and the formation of advanced glycation end products. These pathways involved in proteostasis have been reported to be altered in AD, suggesting that their study may be critical for identifying new biomarkers and target molecules for AD.",Alzheimer| Autophagy| Protein degradation| The ubiquitin–proteasome system,Non-systematic-review,1,0
89,14713669,Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,The social course of drug injection and sexual activity among YMSM and other high-risk youth: an agenda for future research.,"The cumulative epidemiologic literature indicates that many injecting drug users (IDUs) initiate injection as a mode of drug administration during late adolescence or early adulthood. Recent studies have shown that IDUs are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection, highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention. Epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations, most notably young men who have sex with men (YMSM), are at substantial risk for exposure to HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) from early sexual activity. Despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention, however, surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation, including the individual, social, or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use. Similarly, we know little about the ways that YMSM and other high-risk youth understand risk, the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity, or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences. In this article, we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk, and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

How mothers express their experiences is poorly explored in the literature. This study aims to better understand mothers' description of their unique experiences in order to better inform interventions. Using a narrative inquiry approach, mothers convey unique stressors related to two central themes (role fulfillment and role support) during a journal writing intervention. Studying mothers' own words as they attempted to make sense of their experiences aligns with the foundational principles of narrative medicine: People make sense of their experiences through storytelling.

This is possible in Belgium and the Netherlands, where PAD for psychiatric conditions is permitted, though rare, so long as the criteria of due care are met. Those opposed to all instances of PAD point to Belgium and the Netherlands as a dark warning that once PAD is legalized, restricting it will prove impossible because safeguards, such as the requirement that a patient be terminally ill, will inevitably be eroded or discarded. However, some supporters respond that limiting PAD to those suffering from terminal illness, or physical illnesses generally, is arbitrary and illogical. In addition, precisely because such patients are not terminally ill, their suffering may last for years, even the rest of their lives. Finally, severe depression may not be treatable. If PAD is justifiable under some conditions-as I shall assume in this article-then why wouldn't it be justifiable for these patients?

The mismatch between the modern diet and the still ancient biological machinery of humans subtly but chronically disorders their internal milieu, giving rise to a prolonged state of low-grade potassium deficiency and low-grade metabolic acidosis whose severity increases with age. Supplemental KCI cannot redress this mismatch and correct this state. However, the mismatch is redressed and the state corrected by restoring intakes of K+ and HCO3- to levels approaching those in the diet of our prehistoric forebearers, with either fruits and vegetables or with supplemental KHCO3. So restored, KHCO3 can: 1) attenuate hypertension and possibly prevent its occurrence by suppressing the phenomenon of normotensive NaCl-sensitivity, in part by its natriuretic effect; (2) prevent kidney stones by reducing urinary excretion of calcium and increasing urinary excretion of citrate; (3) ameliorate and protect against the occurrence of osteoporosis by increasing the renal retention of calcium and phosphorus, and by suppressing bone resorption and enhancing bone formation; and (4) likely prevent stroke.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

With the structural and mechanistic elucidation of the BBB under both physiological and pathological conditions, it is now viable to target central nervous system (CNS) disorders utilizing the presence of transferrin (Tf) receptors (TfRs). However, overexpression of these TfRs on the GBM cell surface can also help to avoid restrictions of GBM cells to deliver chemotherapeutic agents within the tumor. Therefore, targeting of TfR-mediated delivery could counteract drug delivery issues in GBM and create a delivery system that could cross the BBB effectively to utilize ligand-conjugated drug complexes through receptor-mediated transcytosis. Hence, approach towards successful delivery of antitumor agents to the gliomas has been making possible through targeting these overexpressed TfRs within the CNS and glioma cells.

96,20353432,Headache,Revisiting the role of ergots in the treatment of migraine and headache.,"The harmful side effects of the ergots described by early civilizations have been overcome with efficacious treatment for headaches including migraine, cluster, and chronic daily headache. Use of ergots contributed to initial theories of migraine pathogenesis and provided the substrate for development of the triptans. Triptans are very efficacious for many migraineurs, and since their widespread use, use of ergots has significantly declined. Unfortunately, there remain many migraineurs who benefit little from triptans, yet respond very well to ergots. Discoveries in migraine pathophysiology have given us better understanding of the complex processes involved, although there remain many unknown factors in migraine treatment. Additional, unrecognized therapeutic targets may exist throughout the neuronal connections of the brainstem, cortex, and cerebral vasculature. Ergots interact with a broader spectrum of receptors than triptans. This lack of receptor specificity explains potential ergot side effects, but may also account for efficacy. The role of ergots in headache should be revisited, especially in view of newer ergot formulations with improved tolerability and side effect profiles, such as orally inhaled dihydroergotamine.

Supplementum,Deprenyl in the treatment of Parkinson's disease: clinical effects and speculations on mechanism of action.,"Selegiline is a relatively selective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase type B that has been used in Parkinson's disease as an adjunct to levodopa and as putative neuroprotective therapy. Clinical trials demonstrate that selegiline slows the rate of disease progression and delays the appearance of disability necessitating levodopa. However, confounding symptomatic effects have made it difficult to ascertain the presence of any direct neuroprotective effect. Laboratory studies demonstrate that selegiline protects dopaminergic neurons through a mechanism that does not involve MAO-B inhibition. Recent studies suggest that neuroprotection in laboratory models may be related to the capacity of selegiline to up-regulate a series of anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic molecules which promote cell survival. Further delineation of the precise mechanism whereby selegiline induces this effect may permit for the development of enhanced neuroprotective benefits in PD patients.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

No articles have contested the concept, apart from 3 published 13-18 yr ago. This review describes very recent studies on the role of HSV1 but refers also to older studies that provide background for some lesser-known related topics not covered in other recent reviews; these include the relevance of herpes simplex encephalitis and of epilepsy to AD, the action of IFN, and the possible relevance of the different types of DNA damage to AD-in particular, those caused by HSV1-and mechanisms of repair of damage. New epidemiologic data supporting previous studies on mild cognitive impairment and progression to AD are reviewed, as are those examining the relationship between total infectious burden (additive seropositivity to various microbes) and cognition/AD. The latter indicates the involvement of HSV1 and cytomegalovirus (and the necessity of taking into account any marked differences in sensitivity of antibody detection).

101,24323428,Molecular neurobiology,Hyperphosphorylated tau is implicated in acquired epilepsy and neuropsychiatric comorbidities,"Epilepsy is a common group of neurological diseases. Acquired epilepsy can be caused by brain insults, such as trauma, infection or tumour, and followed by a latent period from several months to years before the emergence of recurrent spontaneous seizures. More than 50% of epilepsy cases will develop chronic neurodegenerative, neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric comorbidities. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which a brain insult results in acquired epilepsy and comorbidities in order to identify targets for novel therapeutic interventions that may mitigate these outcomes. Recent studies have implicated the hyperphosphorylated tubulin-associated protein (tau) in rodent models of epilepsy and Alzheimer's disease, and in experimental and clinical studies of traumatic brain injury. This potentially represents a novel target to mitigate epilepsy and associated neurocognitive and psychiatric disorders post-brain injury.

The major lens protein, alpha-crystallin, is a member of the small heat-shock protein (sHsp) family of intracellular molecular chaperone proteins that prevent protein aggregation. Whilst the chaperone activity of sHsps against amorphously aggregating proteins has been well studied, its action against fibril-forming proteins has received less attention despite the presence of sHsps in deposits found in fibril-associated diseases (e.g. Alzheimer's and Parkinson's). In this review, the literature on the interaction of alphaB-crystallin and other sHsps with fibril-forming proteins is summarized. In particular, the ability of sHsps to prevent fibril formation, their mechanisms of action and the possible in vivo consequences of such associations are discussed.

106,15199474,Seminars in vascular medicine,"P2Y12, a new platelet ADP receptor, target of clopidogrel.","Clopidogrel is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of clopidogrel over aspirin in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of clopidogrel is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of ADP binding to a purinergic receptor present at the platelet surface. Clopidogrel is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several purinergic receptors have been described on platelets; P2X (1), a calcium channel, and P2Y1 a Gq-coupled seven-transmembrane domain receptor, have been found not to be antagonized by clopidogrel. Another Gi (2)-coupled receptor (named P2Y12) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for (33)P-2MeS-ADP, a stable analogue of ADP, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of (33)P-2MeS-ADP to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, ADP and 2MeS-ADP induced adenylyl cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of clopidogrel. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called 'P2t' platelet receptor and show that the active metabolite of clopidogrel binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of ADP on platelets.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Avoidance, or amelioration, of this secondary injury depends on early diagnosis and intervention before permanent injury occurs. However, tools to monitor brain oxygenation continuously in the neuro-intensive care unit have been lacking.	In recent times, methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage head-injured patients. These monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention, help interpret pathophysiological changes (e.g., hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure), monitor interventions (e.g., hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure), and prognosticate. This review focuses on jugular venous saturation, brain tissue oxygen tension, and near-infrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury, with a particular focus on the available evidence in children. However, to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed, it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor, as well as respective strengths and limitations of each. It is equally important that the clinician understands relevant aspects of brain oxygen physiology and head trauma pathophysiology to enable correct interpretation of the monitored data and therefore to direct an appropriate therapeutic response that is likely to benefit, not harm, the patient.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
110,1480765,Progress in brain research,"Brain banking and the human hypothalamus--factors to match for, pitfalls and potentials.","The study of an increasing number of processes occurring in the human brain can be carried out on autopsy material. The availability of this material, whether fresh, frozen or fixed, makes it possible to develop methodologies for studying the neuroanatomical and neurochemical aspects of the human brain. It has also become possible in recent years to correlate functional changes with neurochemical changes and with neuroanatomical abnormalities in disease states. Some compounds and structures are damaged irreversibly within minutes after death and some brain components are known to disintegrate within seconds. This led to the widespread idea that autopsy material would not be suitable for basic research purposes and would not supply the necessary answers on the various fundamental questions regarding processes occurring in normal or diseased brain. However, from data published in recent years in which autopsy material has been routinely used, it becomes more and more evident that this is a misconception. There is an increasing number of reports based on the use of normal and pathological human brain tissue obtained by autopsies in spite of the fact that there is a worrying continuous decline in autopsy rate which causes serious concern among scientists world-wide (Anderson and Hill, 1989). It also became evident that when using the proper fixation procedures, sufficient structural integrity is retained in the tissue to allow morphological and morphometrical studies (Swaab and Uylings, 1988). Electron microscopic examination of synaptosomal preparations from post-mortem human brain showed them to be only slightly less pure than preparations from fresh tissue although there was some degree of damage (Hardy et al., 1982). Agonal state effects the stability of brain compounds and causes brain hypoxia. This again forms a tremendous difficulty for the study of human neurological and psychiatric diseases as one of the frequent causes of death is bronchopneumonia which leads to brain hypoxia and results in pronounced lactic acidosis. The Netherlands Brain Bank has succeeded to partly circumvent some of the serious problems encountered in providing human tissue for research by performing rapid autopsies with an average post-mortem delay of 2-4 h. This has become possible by a close collaboration of numerous nursing homes in Amsterdam and its vicinity and with the neuropathologists of the Free University in Amsterdam. We also measure the pH of the tissue as indicator of agonal state in order to reveal unsuitable specimens.

The diagnosis of these psychiatric comorbidities becomes particularly complex, for clinical manifestations vary and patients may not fulfil the criteria of traditional diagnostic classifications. RESULTS: Mood disorders are the more frequent conditions associated with epilepsy, followed by anxiety, attention-deficit, psychotic and personality disorders. Patients with focal epilepsies, and mainly those with temporal and frontal lobe epilepsy, have a greater incidence of depression, anxiety or psychosis, compared with the general population. For a long time, patients and physicians tended to focus solely on the control of epileptic seizures, while disregarding the presence of comorbid psychiatric symptoms and disorders. Recognition of their negative impact in the life of patients with epilepsy in recent years has highlighted the need for their early identification with a careful psychiatric history or, at the least, to screen for the presence of psychiatric symptoms with objective scales. Furthermore, the identification of psychiatric symptoms plays an important role in the choice of antiepileptic drugs as some are known to have positive or negative psychotropic effects. CONCLUSION: An early diagnosis of comorbid psychiatric disorders and a multidisciplinary approach in the evaluation and management of these patients result in the selection of an optimal comprehensive treatment.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Current achievements and future directions.,"The prevalence of age-related diseases that implicate a deterioration of cognitive abilities is increasing. Moreover, cognitive decline occurs in numerous CNS disorders affecting patients at younger ages as well, resulting in reduced functional ability and quality of life. Despite the existence of few medications treating cognition, the need for efficacious treatment options to alleviate, halt or even prevent cognitive decline is generally unmet to date. Consequently, extensive research efforts are undertaken to identify medications that can effectively enhance cognition.	This review covers ongoing clinical trials for cognition and reflects on efforts undertaken to increase the success rates of procognitive drug treatment. The review discusses ways to optimize the drug development process for cognition enhancing agents at the preclinical to clinical interface and provides concrete examples.	The existing efficacy readouts addressing cognition in preclinical research offer little translational validity to the clinical situation. In order to identify truly efficacious drug candidates, biomarkers need to be developed that directly address conserved mechanisms underlying cognitive performances. To this end, technologies such as neuroimaging or electroencephalography constitute promising entry points for identifying both the cognitive domain and the patient population most responsive to drug treatment.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

116,30059725,Neurobiology of disease,"Affective, neurocognitive and psychosocial disorders associated with traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic epilepsy","Survivors of traumatic brain injury (TBI) often develop chronic neurological, neurocognitive, psychological, and psychosocial deficits that can have a profound impact on an individual's wellbeing and quality of life. TBI is also a common cause of acquired epilepsy, which is itself associated with significant behavioral morbidity. This review considers the clinical and preclinical evidence that post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) acts as a 'second-hit' insult to worsen chronic behavioral outcomes for brain-injured patients, across the domains of emotional, cognitive, and psychosocial functioning. Surprisingly, few well-designed studies have specifically examined the relationship between seizures and behavioral outcomes after TBI. The complex mechanisms underlying these comorbidities remain incompletely understood, although many of the biological processes that precipitate seizure occurrence and epileptogenesis may also contribute to the development of chronic behavioral deficits. Further, the relationship between PTE and behavioral dysfunction is increasingly recognized to be a bidirectional one, whereby premorbid conditions are a risk factor for PTE. Clinical studies in this arena are often challenged by the confounding effects of anti-seizure medications, while preclinical studies have rarely examined an adequately extended time course to fully capture the time course of epilepsy development after a TBI. To drive the field forward towards improved treatment strategies, it is imperative that both seizures and neurobehavioral outcomes are assessed in parallel after TBI, both in patient populations and preclinical models.",Anxiety| Co-morbidity| Cognition| Depression| Epilepsy| Seizure| Social behavior| Traumatic brain injury,Non-systematic-review,1,0

In these countries pharyngeal spread is the principal means of poliovirus transmission, and it is effectively blocked by use of killed poliovirus vaccine. In countries where poliomyelitis is endemic the fecal-oral route of spread may play a more significant role; it remains to be seen if there will be an epidemiologic effect from the reduction in fecal virus excretion that is associated with high levels of serum antibody induced by potent killed poliovirus vaccine.

Three of these factors (Nogo-A, oligodendrocyte myelin glycoprotein, myelin-associated glycoprotein) bind to a common receptor: the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1). NgR1 is expressed mainly on neurons and is usually associated in a trimolecular complex. The second member of the complex, LINGO-1, is often connected to NgR1 function and is further found to function independently as a negative regulator of oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation. The third member of the NgR complex is either the p75 neurotrophin receptor, TROY, or an as yet unidentified co-receptor. Targeting of factors contained in this complex has been described to lead to the promotion of neurite outgrowth, oligodendrocyte proliferation and differentiation and inhibition of cell death. In the current review, we aim to describe the mechanisms of action of the chemical and biological compounds used in targeting NgR1 and LINGO-1. This will be achieved using three examples: blocking of ligand binding to NgR1 in treatment of spinal cord injury, antibody-mediated inhibition of LINGO-1 to promote oligodendrocyte differentiation in multiple sclerosis, and the use of soluble NgR1 to sequester Abeta peptide in the periphery in Alzheimer's disease.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

120,25359445,Pituitary,Update on radiation therapy in patients with Cushing's disease.,"Radiation therapy is an important therapy for patients with Cushing's disease who are not in remission or relapse after transsphenoidal pituitary surgery and are not considered surgical candidates. The development of stereotactic radiation therapy, using gamma knife, linear accelerators or proton beam based methods, has enabled selective radiation delivery to the target while minimizing exposure of healthy tissues. In patients whose tumors are sufficiently distant from the optic apparatus, stereotactic radiation therapy can be delivered in a single session, a procedure termed radiosurgery, which significantly improves patient convenience.	Original articles on radiation therapy in Cushing's disease, published during the past 12 months (2013-2014), were identified and pertinent data extracted.	Recent studies have reported on the outcomes of patients with Cushing's disease who received mostly stereotactic radiation therapy. While tumor control has been excellent, biochemical remission was less consistently achieved. Some studies suggested that stereotactic radiation may lead to biochemical remission faster than conventional radiation therapy. In addition, retrospective data have suggested that withdrawing medical therapy around the time stereotactic radiation therapy is administered might lead to a faster biochemical response. Regardless of the radiation therapy method, biochemical recurrences may develop and these patients are at long-term risk of developing anterior hypopituitarism and require lifelong periodic endocrine follow-up. Other, less frequent complications may include cranial neuropathies, secondary tumor formation or temporal lobe necrosis. It is plausible that complications may be less frequent after stereotactic radiation therapy, but this requires confirmation.	Radiation therapy is an effective second line therapy in patients with Cushing's disease. Ongoing refinements in delivery of radiation therapy are anticipated to lead to improved patient outcomes, but long-term follow-up data, including adequate control groups, are needed to fully investigate this possibility.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This study was completed in three parts: (1) a narrative review of the literature; (2) an open-ended survey sent to the first authors of the identified articles; and (3) a descriptive analysis of responses. Results revealed that 56.7% of the identified articles did not report enough information of assessment procedures, 18.9% followed the assessment manual, 16.9% provided accommodations on a needs basis, and 7.5% used a consistent modified protocol. Individual responses showed that extra demonstrations (n = 5) were the most frequent accommodation, followed by extra breaks (n = 3), picture cards (n = 2), and hand-over-hand assistance (n = 1); some respondents stated that they did not provide accommodations. The findings indicate that a clear set of accommodation for motor skill assessments does not exist, though some commonalities were reported.

While accomplishing this, constricting bonds to his late sister Katherine and to his mother were loosened as well.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
124,33691710,Journal of neuroengineering and rehabilitation,Comment: difference between assessment of upper limb movement and upper limb associated reactions during walking.,"While walking, people swing their arms in a specific pattern. This specific arm swing pattern during walking has shown to have a beneficial effect on gait as it reduces walking energy cost and optimizes balance. In several patient populations the arm movements can be directly affected (e.g. in patients with acquired brain injury (ABI)), which in turn has a negative effect on their gait pattern, balance and energy cost of walking.	In December 2019, Kahn et al. published a paper in JNER concerning the quantification of upper limb associated reactions (ARs) during walking in people with ABI. ARs are defined as 'an effort-dependent phenomenon causing an involuntary increase in upper limb muscle tone, with awkward and uncomfortable postures'. These upper limb ARs appear often in patients with ABI and can have an important effect on their gait. The authors calculated kinematic measures using three-dimensional gait analysis relating to range of motion, variability and mean position over the gait cycle for the different upper limb joints (shoulder, elbow, wrist) during self-selected steady-state walking. Based on differences they found between an ABI cohort and healthy control cohort, the authors concluded that they were able to quantify ARs during walking in this population. This calculation, however, is not specific for upper limb ARs. In fact, the authors calculated general measures of arm posture (e.g. mean position over the gait cycle) or arm movement (e.g. range of motion and variability) during gait. Previous research has already indicated that other factors than ARs can influence the posture or movement of the arm during gait in patients with brain injury, such as voluntary compensations for gait instability and contractures or spasticity of upper arm muscles. Yet, it is not possible to disentangle the different causes of the altered arm posture during steady-state walking based on the proposed measures.	The kinematic arm measures proposed by Kahn et al. (J Neuroeng Rehabil 16(1):160, 2019) are not a direct measure of ARs, but provide a quantification of overall deviation of arm posture or movement during gait. Depending on the specific study design these measures may provide insights in ARs.",Arm posture| Arm swing| Coordination| Gait| Kinematics| Spasticity,Non-systematic-review,1,0
125,27314344,International journal of molecular sciences,Roles of PTEN with DNA Repair in Parkinson's Disease.,"Oxidative stress is considered to play key roles in aging and pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease, which could bring DNA damage by cells. The DNA damage may lead to the cell apoptosis, which could contribute to the degeneration of neuronal tissues. Recent evidence suggests that PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog on chromosome 10) may be involved in the pathophysiology of the neurodegenerative disorders. Since PTEN expression appears to be one dominant determinant of the neuronal cell death, PTEN should be a potential molecular target of novel therapeutic strategies against Parkinson's disease. In addition, defects in DNA damage response and DNA repair are often associated with modulation of hormone signaling pathways. Especially, many observations imply a role for estrogen in a regulation of the DNA repair action. In the present review, we have attempted to summarize the function of DNA repair molecules at a viewpoint of the PTEN signaling pathway and the hormone related functional modulation of cells, providing a broad interpretation on the molecular mechanisms for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Particular attention will be paid to the mechanisms proposed to explain the health effects of food ingredients against Parkinson's disease related to reduce oxidative stress for an efficient therapeutic intervention.",BRCA1| DNA repair| PTEN| Parkinson’s disease| ROS| estrogen| oxidative stress,Non-systematic-review,1,0
126,17917563,International clinical psychopharmacology,High-quality remission: potential benefits of the melatonergic approach for patients with major depressive disorder.,"Full remission of symptoms is the goal for the acute treatment of depression, because incomplete remission is associated with poor outcomes including higher risk of relapse and chronicity. The current definitions for remission (e.g. a score of </=7 on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), however, allow for the presence of residual symptoms of depression even if remission is attained. The focus now is on the quality of remission, that is, ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms, because the consequences of low-quality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning. The most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances, fatigue, and disinterest. Sleep-associated residual symptoms are particularly common, and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them. Other side effects of current treatments, such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction, may also reduce the quality of remission. A novel approach to the treatment of depression with agomelatine, a melatonergic MT1 and MT2 receptor agonist and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist, may be an effective treatment that improves the quality of remission, as it combines good efficacy with positive effects on sleep, neutral effects on sexual function, and a favorable side effect profile.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Usually these morbidities cluster together in a single patient. Rather than these being separate conditions, all, including the seizures, are manifestations or coexpressions of developmental brain disorders. Instead of viewing epilepsy as the disease and the other features as comorbidities, approaching early-life epilepsies as part of the spectrum of developmental brain disorders could have implications for multidisciplinary care models, anticipatory guidance, and counseling of parents, as well as the design of randomized trials and targeting important outcomes.

Accumulating evidence has shown that TLE is a disorder of abnormal epileptogenic networks, rather than focal sources. Graph theory allows for a network-based representation of TLE brain networks, and has potential to illuminate characteristics of brain topology conducive to TLE pathophysiology, including seizure initiation and spread. We review basic concepts which we believe will prove helpful in interpreting results rapidly emerging from graph theory research in TLE. In addition, we summarize the current state of graph theory findings in TLE as they pertain its pathophysiology. Several common findings have emerged from the many modalities which have been used to study TLE using graph theory, including structural MRI, diffusion tensor imaging, surface EEG, intracranial EEG, magnetoencephalography, functional MRI, cell cultures, simulated models, and mouse models, involving increased regularity of the interictal network configuration, altered local segregation and global integration of the TLE network, and network reorganization of temporal lobe and limbic structures. As different modalities provide different views of the same phenomenon, future studies integrating data from multiple modalities are needed to clarify findings and contribute to the formation of a coherent theory on the pathophysiology of TLE.",Diffusion tensor imaging| Functional connectivity| Graph theory| Pathophysiology| Small-world networks| Temporal lobe epilepsy,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Given the evolving state of the ET field with respect to these non-motor features, the purpose of this manuscript is to critically review the current data. METHODS: A PubMed search was conducted on July 1, 2015. The term ""essential tremor"" was crossed in sequential order with 13 additional search terms (e.g., ""cognitive"", ""dementia"", ""depression""). The total number of unique hits was 322. RESULTS: Numerous studies seem to substantiate the presence of a range of non-motor features occurring in excess in ET cases compared to age-matched controls. These comprise cognitive features (including a full spectrum from mild cognitive difficulty through to frank dementia), psychiatric (including depression, apathy, anxiety, and personality characteristics), sensory (hearing and possibly olfactory abnormalities), and other non-motor features (e.g., sleep dysregulation). Emerging evidence suggests that some of these features could be primary disease features that pre-date motor features of ET.

137,26867166,Current opinion in pediatrics,"Environmental exposure to metals, neurodevelopment, and psychosis.","This article presents a new hypothesis about the possible relation between early life exposure to metals and psychosis. We review limitations of available research, and discuss novel approaches to overcome previous methodological barriers.	Mechanistic studies suggest a possible association between excess lead, manganese, cadmium, arsenic, or copper, and zinc deficiency, and several biochemical disturbances related to psychosis, such as altered neurotransmitters levels, excitotoxicity, and inflammation. Furthermore, studies suggest that some metals (lead, manganese, cadmium excess, and zinc deficiency) are associated with schizophrenia or psychosis-related phenotype. However, previous studies had multiple methodological limitations. Importantly, metal exposure was often measured after disease development and seldom determined during critical developmental periods. Most studies fell short of depicting the exact timing of exposure and the change in exposure over time. Here, we propose several methods to overcome these methodological limitations.	There is a plausible role of early life exposure to metals in the cause of psychosis. Owing to methodological limitations in exposure measurement, this has not been well characterized. Considering the wide exposure to metals and the high cost of psychosis to society, this hypothesis should be rigorously examined.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Although several neurotransmitter systems dysfunction and neuroanatomical abnormalities have been implicated in RLS pathogenesis, dopamine dysfunction within basal ganglia pathways, iron deficiency and opioid system abnormalities have consistently been found to be involved. Their involvement is further strengthened by the therapeutic effectiveness of dopaminergic agents, iron supplementation and opioid medications.	Converging evidence from neuroimaging, autoptic and animal studies points towards dopamine dysregulation and iron metabolism alterations as the main contributors to RLS pathophysiology.

We summarize emerging literature on functional neuroimaging biomarkers of resilience in MDD and discuss their clinical relevance and implications for future research.	Resilience in MDD is characterized by dissociable profiles of activation and functional connectivity within brain networks involved in cognitive control, emotion regulation, and reward processing. Increased activation of frontal cortical brain regions implicated in cognitive appraisal and emotion regulation is a common characteristic of resilient individuals at high risk for MDD and of individuals with MDD with a favorable illness course. Furthermore, significant associations between fronto-striato-limbic functional connectivity and both positively interpreted stressful life events in resilient high-risk individuals and a favorable response to first-line treatments in depressed individuals suggest that neuro-compensatory changes and experience-dependent plasticity underlie resilience in MDD.

Our understanding of the mechanism of action of this surgical treatment has greatly benefited from functional imaging studies. Most of these studies have been conducted in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) treated by bilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. These studies have notably underlined the fact that STN stimulation influences motor, limbic, or associative cortical-subcortical loops in various (sometimes contradictory) ways. We present an up-to-date review of the information provided by functional imaging studies in surgery for PD, dystonia, tremor, as well as in psychiatric disorders such as depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder. On the basis of this information, proposed mechanisms of action of DBS are discussed, as well as the need for additional approaches such as improved anatomical localization of the contact used for stimulation or a better understanding of the electrical distribution around the electrode.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

An 11-year-old Chinese girl presented with sudden onset of bilateral blurred vision. The clinical history, imaging studies, and molecular analysis results were reviewed. The PubMed and OVID databases were used for literature review.	Nonischemic CRVO in the subject's right eye and tortuosity of small and medium-sized retinal arterioles in the left eye were found at initial presentation. Bilateral optic disc pallor was then noted with recovery of CRVO. Severe headache and several stroke-like episodes occurred subsequently, with elevated lactate levels in serum and cerebrospinal fluid. LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome was diagnosed, and mitochondrial DNA sequencing revealed G13513A heteroplasmic mutation. Vision was 20/30 in the right eye and 20/800 in the left eye at the last visit.	Mitochondrial DNA G13513A mutation can cause LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome. Nonischemic CRVO is a rare manifestation of LHON/MELAS. Atypical findings in cases of LHON should raise the suspicion of overlap syndrome or other mitochondrial diseases.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

153,11172874,Journal of affective disorders,Serotonergic gene expression and depression: implications for developing novel antidepressants.,"The development and configuration of several neural networks is dependent on the actions of serotonin (5-HT) acting through multiple hetero- and autoreceptor subtypes. During early brain development 5-HT modulates morphogenetic activities, such as neural differentiation, axon outgrowth, and synaptic modeling. In the adult brain, midbrain raphe serotonergic neurons project to a variety of brain regions and modulate a wide range of physiological functions. Several lines of evidence indicate that genetically determined variability in serotonergic gene expression, as it has been documented for the 5-HT transporter, influences temperamental traits and may lead to psychopathological conditions with increased anxiety, depression, and aggression. Investigation of the regulation of serotonergic gene transcription and its impact on neuronal development, synaptic plasticity, and neurogenesis spur interest to identify serotonergic gene-related molecular factors underlying disease states and to develop more effective antidepressant treatment strategies. Gene targeting strategies have increasingly been integrated into investigations of brain function and along with the fading dogma of a limited capacity of neurons for regeneration and reproducibility, it is realized that gene transfer techniques using efficient viral vectors in conjunction with neuron-selective transcriptional control systems may also be applicable to complex disorders of the brain. Given the fact that the 5-HT system continues to be an important target for drug development and production, novel strategies aiming toward the modification of 5-HT function at the level of gene expression are likely to be exploited by enterprises participating actively in the introduction of alternative therapeutic approaches.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

It is believed to be vastly underdiagnosed, as there is a significant disparity between the number of cases diagnosed clinically and those diagnosed via neuropathology at the time of postmortem autopsy. Strikingly, many of the pharmacologic treatments used to treat behavioral and cognitive symptoms in other forms of dementia exacerbate the symptoms of DLB. Therefore, it is critical to accurately diagnose DLB as these patients require a specific treatment approach.

The underlying pathophysiology of sleep abnormalities across neuropsychiatric disorders remains unclear, and may involve the inter-play of several clinical variables and mechanistic pathways. In this review, we propose a heuristic framework in which reciprocal interactions of immune, oxidative and nitrosative stress, and mitochondrial pathways may drive sleep abnormalities across potentially neuroprogressive disorders. Specifically, it is proposed that systemic inflammation may activate microglial cells and astrocytes in brain regions involved in sleep and circadian regulation. Activated glial cells may secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines (for example, interleukin-1 beta and tumour necrosis factor alpha), nitric oxide and gliotransmitters, which may influence the expression of key circadian regulators (e.g., the Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput (CLOCK) gene). Furthermore, sleep disruption may further aggravate oxidative and nitrosative, peripheral immune activation, and (neuro) inflammation across these disorders in a vicious pathophysiological loop. This review will focus on chronic fatigue syndrome, bipolar disorder, and multiple sclerosis as exemplars of neuro-immune disorders. We conclude that novel therapeutic targets exploring immune and oxidative & nitrosative pathways (p.e. melatonin and molecular hydrogen) hold promise in alleviating sleep and circadian dysfunction in these disorders.",Bipolar disorder| Chronic fatigue syndrome| Inflammation| Multiple sclerosis| Oxidative stress| Sleep,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Whether that assumption is valid, and how it might impact assessment of PTSS, is unknown.	Survivors in the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort study completed an assessment of PTSS without cancer orientation, global psychological functioning, perceived stress, and cancer-related anxiety.	Participants (n = 2969; Mage = 32.5 ± 8.5 years, 24.1 years since diagnosis, 49.1% female) obtained a mean score on the PTSD Checklist of 27.7, which is comparable to a normative population. Using established cutoffs, 11.8% obtained scores in the at-risk range. Multivariable modeling indicated that psychological factors [global distress (p < 0.0001), perceived stress (p = 0.001), cancer-related anxiety (p < 0.0001)] and demographic variables [female gender (p < 0.0001), survivors with less than a college education (p = 0.002)] were risk factors for increased PTSS. Only 14.5% identified a cancer-related traumatic event, and there was no difference in PTSS scores between those who identified cancer vs. non-cancer events as most stressful (28.4 ± 12.6 vs. 28.5 ± 12.7, p = 0.93).	One in eight adult long-term survivors of childhood cancer had PTSS above the cutoff, though subgroups (e.g., females and those with lower education) report more distress symptoms.

157,24234352,Seminars in neurology,Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative cause of dementia and is responsible for significant individual morbidity and mortality, and economic impact on the health care system. Neurodegeneration (including neuronal atrophy and/or loss) are attributed to extraneuronal toxic amyloid oligomers and proteins, intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau, region-specific diminished cerebral glucose metabolism, synaptic dysfunction, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Several of these pathologic changes may occur decades before symptom onset, leaving ample time for implementing prevention strategies that target the earliest stages of the disease. In recent years, a myriad of modifiable and nonmodifiable risk factors have been elucidated. We describe the latest criteria for the diagnosis of AD, including earliest diagnostic stage of preclinical AD, which has the highest potential for research, including diagnosis and disease modification. We discuss both FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments, as well as nonpharmacologic strategies for AD therapeutics, including prevention via evidence-based, low-risk interventions. Genotype is an important consideration in managing patients on the AD continuum, as presence of the APOE ε4 allele may influence response to treatment.

158,10749516,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Is there a role for therapeutic drug monitoring of new anticonvulsants?,"Despite the fact that all new anticonvulsants have undergone extensive pharmacokinetic scrutiny prior to their introduction to the market, the opportunity to perform good prospective studies on their concentration-effect relationship has been largely missed, in some cases deliberately because therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) is considered unfavourable for the marketing of a new drug. However, there are reasons to believe that TDM may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants. In fact, these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index, careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required, and inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements. The wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that TDM cannot be useful: indeed, a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants. The new anticonvulsants which, based on their properties, are particularly attractive candidates for TDM include lamotrigine, topiramate, tiagabine, zonisamide and felbamate. However, in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs, the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended. Despite this, serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients, especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated. Even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability, it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response, and apply that information in subsequent management. Prospective studies, using preferably a randomised concentration-controlled design, are necessary to better characterise concentration-effect relationships for these agents.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

After birth, it may cause a series of neurological symptoms, even with retina, kidney, liver, and other organ abnormalities, which is defined as Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD). Molecular genetics research contributes to disease prediction and genetic counseling. Prenatal diagnosis is rare. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is usually the first-choice diagnostic modality with typical brain images characterized by the molar tooth sign. We describe a case of JS prenatally and Dandy-Walker malformation for the differential diagnosis based on ultrasonograms. We also review the etiology, imaging features, clinical symptoms, and diagnosis of JSRD.	A 22-year-old woman was pregnant at 27 1/7 weeks' gestation with fetal cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. Fetal ultrasonography and MRI confirmed a diagnosis of JS at our center. The couple finally opted to terminate the fetus, which had a normal appearance and growth parameters. The couple also had an AHI1 gene mutation on chromosome 6.	Currently, a diagnosis of JS is commonly made after birth.

Approximately 30% of patients fail to respond to present therapies. Therefore, the search for novel antidepressant drugs continues.	The most prescribed antidepressants are serotonin reuptake inhibitors and/or noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, which only indirectly affect dopaminergic neurotransmission. As a consequence, residual symptoms remain, including impaired motivation and impaired pleasure. This article reviews the development of new broad-spectrum antidepressants, the triple reuptake inhibitors, which also increase brain dopamine levels.	In this review, a distinction is made between the subtypes of melancholic and atypical depressions and their associated brain abnormalities and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems. Subsequently, we propose a hypothetical model: 'the monoamine hypothesis revisited' to predict what kind of pharmacological treatment will be effective in the different subtypes of depression. It is expected that the triple reuptake inhibitors, inhibiting the reuptake of all three monoamines, can produce a greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants especially in atypical depression. Since triple reuptake inhibitors may also dampen states of hyperglutamatergic activity and subsequent excitotoxicity, it is suggested that these new drugs have a considerable neuroprotective potential in major depression, especially in melancholic depression.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

The definition of medulloblastoma entities now requires a combination of the traditional histological information with additional molecular/genetic features. For definition of the histopathological component of the medulloblastoma diagnosis, the tumors should be assigned to one of the four entities classic, desmoplastic/nodular (DNMB), extensive nodular (MBEN), or large cell/anaplastic (LC/A) medulloblastoma. The genetically defined component comprises the four entities WNT-activated, SHH-activated and TP53 wildtype, SHH-activated and TP53 mutant, or non-WNT/non-SHH medulloblastoma. Robust and validated methods are available to allow a precise diagnosis of these medulloblastoma entities according to the updated WHO classification, and for differential diagnostic purposes. A combination of immunohistochemical markers including β-catenin, Yap1, p75-NGFR, Otx2, and p53, in combination with targeted sequencing and copy number assessment such as FISH analysis for MYC genes allows a precise assignment of patients for risk-adapted stratification. It also allows comparison to results of study cohorts in the past and provides a robust basis for further treatment refinement. .",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Decline of this ability, as observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD), results in an impaired sense of self and identity. In our model (AMAD: Autobiographical Memory in Alzheimer's Disease), we present a critical review of theories and findings regarding cognitive and neuroanatomical underpinnings of autobiographical memory and its decline in AD and highlight studies on its clinical rehabilitation. We propose that autobiographical recall in AD is mainly characterized by loss of associated episodic information, which leads to de-contextualization of autobiographical memories and a shift from reliving past events to a general sense of familiarity. This decline refers to retrograde, but also anterograde amnesia that affects newly acquired memories besides remote ones. One consequence of autobiographical memory decline in AD is decreased access to memories that shape self-consciousness, self-knowledge, and self-images, leading to a diminished sense of self and identity. The link between autobiographical decline and compromised sense of self in AD can also manifest itself as low correspondence and coherence between past memories and current goals and beliefs. By linking cognitive, neuroanatomical, and clinical aspects of autobiographical decline in AD, our review provides a theoretical foundation, which may lead to better rehabilitation strategies.",Alzheimer’ s disease| Autobiographical memory| Executive function| Hippocampus| Personal identity| Rehabilitation| Sense of self,Non-systematic-review,1,0

This agent, termed prion by Stanley Prusiner, is thought to consist partly of PrP(Sc), a conformational isoform of a normal cellular protein termed PrP(C). Scientists and lay persons have been fascinated by the prion concept, and it has been subjected to passionate critique and intense experimental scrutiny. As a result, PrP(C) and its isoforms rank among the most intensively studied proteins encoded by the mammalian genome. Despite all this research, both the physiological function of PrP(C) and the molecular pathways leading to neurodegeneration in prion disease remain unknown.

The pathological conformer PrP(sc) would be the agent of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies or prion diseases.

The conversion of PrP(c) into PrP(sc) in the brain governs the clinical phenotype of the disease. However, the three-dimensional structure change of PrP(c) can also take place outside the central nervous system, in nonneuronal cells particularly of lymphoid tissue where the agent replicates. In natural infection, PrP(c) in nonneuronal cells of peripheral extracerebral organs may play a key role as the receptor required to enable the entry of the infectious agent into the host. In the present review we have undertaken a first evaluation of compelling data concerning the PrP(c)-expressing cells of nonneuronal origin present in cerebral and extracerebral tissues.

In the United States (US) each year, 170 million adults participate in physical recreational activities, and 38 million children and adolescents participate in organized sports. The Centers for Disease Control estimate that in this group ~1.6 to 3.8 million concussions occur annually. Recent class-action lawsuits in the US filed by professional athletes against their respective leagues allege negligence in protecting them from concussions, and this has contributed to the attention received in the popular media. In response, concussion-related publications have increased exponentially during the past several years. Recent studies have challenged earlier assumptions that the effects of concussion are transient. Stronger links between concussion and neurodegenerative processes such as Alzheimer's disease-like conditions, depression, and heightened risk for suicide are being elucidated. In this article, we explore the current knowledge on concussion, including pathophysiology, management, and long-term effects. We conclude that more evidence-based results regarding guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, and return to play (RTP) are needed and should be the focus of future investigations. Attributing the etiology of certain neurodegenerative conditions to a history of concussion has been suggested in the current literature, but additional quantitative data regarding the pathophysiology and causality are needed as well. Bioengineers can have an important role in measuring the dynamic forces encountered during head impacts and their effects on the brain. These results can be effective in designing better helmets as well as improved playing surfaces to reduce the impact of such injuries. At this time, we believe that groups of people with heightened risk for concussion should be followed closely during longer periods of time and compared to matched controls.

However, histopathologic studies demonstrate considerable differences between plaques with identical degrees of stenosis and indicate that certain plaque features are associated with increased risk for ischemic events. The ability to look beyond the lumen using highly developed vessel wall imaging methods to identify plaque vulnerable to disruption has prompted an active debate as to whether a paradigm shift is needed to move away from relying on measurements of luminal stenosis for gauging the risk of ischemic injury. Further evaluation in randomized clinical trials will help to better define the exact role of plaque imaging in clinical decision-making.

175,18991888,Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,An endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward and drug addiction.,"Pharmacologic treatment of drug and alcohol dependency has largely been disappointing, and new therapeutic targets and hypotheses are needed. There is accumulating evidence indicating a central role for the previously unknown but ubiquitous endocannabinoid physiological control system (EPCS) in the regulation of the rewarding effects of abused substances. Thus an endocannabinoid hypothesis of drug reward is postulated. Endocannabinoids mediate retrograde signaling in neuronal tissues and are involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission to suppress neurotransmitter release by the presynaptic cannabinoid receptors (CB-Rs). This powerful modulatory action on synaptic transmission has significant functional implications and interactions with the effects of abused substances. Our data, along with those from other investigators, provide strong new evidence for a role for EPCS modulation in the effects of drugs of abuse, and specifically for involvement of cannabinoid receptors in the neural basis of addiction. Cannabinoids and endocannabinoids appear to be involved in adding to the rewarding effects of addictive substances, including, nicotine, opiates, alcohol, cocaine, and BDZs. The results suggest that the EPCS may be an important natural regulatory mechanism for drug reward and a target for the treatment of addictive disorders.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Correct diagnosis may be delayed by the occult location of the delivery system, delayed onset of symptoms, prolonged action, absence of peripheral manifestations, and negative toxicologic screening tests.

They are G-protein coupled, mostly presynaptic, and are involved in the control of the synthesis and/or release of different neurotransmitters both in the central nervous system and the periphery. The availabiliy of specific ligands has permitted the study of potential therapeutic applications of either stimulating or blocking the function of these receptors. There is experimental evidence that drugs targeted at histamine H(3) receptors could be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, drug abuse and several affective, appetite and sleeping disorders, among others.

Most causes are benign and treatable. This review aims to make physicians more alert to the frequent causes of dizziness in the young.	Epidemiological data confirm that migraine-related syndromes are the most common cause of vertigo in children. Vestibular migraine and benign paroxysmal vertigo have now been defined by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. About half of the adolescents with vertigo and dizziness show psychiatric comorbidity and somatization. Vestibular paroxysmia has been described as a new entity in children that can be treated with low doses of carbamazepine. To assess vestibular deficits, video head impulses (for the semicircular canals) and vestibular-evoked myogenic potentials (for the otoliths) are increasingly being used.	Pediatricians and neuro-otologists should be aware of the full spectrum of causes of vertigo and dizziness in children and adolescents. Vestibular function can reliably be tested nowadays. Although treatment for the common migraine-related syndromes can be done in analogy to the treatment of migraine in general, specific approaches are required for somatoform vertigo, the most frequent diagnosis in adolescent girls.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

184,29074330,Schizophrenia research,Motor dysfunction as an intermediate phenotype across schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders: Progress and perspectives,"Primary motor abnormalities (PMA), as found in patients with schizophrenia, are quantitatively and qualitatively distinct markers of motor system abnormalities. PMA have been often referred to phenomena that are present across schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. A dysfunction of frontoparietal and subcortical networks has been proposed as core pathophysiological mechanism underlying the expression of PMA. However, it is unclear at present if such mechanisms are a common within schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. To address this question, we review recent neuroimaging studies investigating the neural substrates of PMA in schizophrenia and so-called ""nonschizophrenic nonaffective psychoses"" (NSNAP) such as schizophreniform, schizoaffective, brief psychotic, and other unspecified psychotic disorders. Although the extant data in patients with schizophrenia suggests that further investigation is warranted, MRI findings in NSNAP are less persuasive. It is unclear so far which PMA, if any, are characteristic features of NSNAP or, possibly even specific for these disorders. Preliminary data suggest a relationship between relapsing-remitting PMA in hyper-/hypokinetic cycloid syndromes and neurodegenerative disorders of the basal ganglia, likely reflecting the transnosological relevance of subcortical abnormalities. Despite this evidence, neural substrates and mechanisms underlying PMA that are common in schizophrenia and NSNAP cannot be clearly delineated at this stage of research. PMA and their underlying brain circuits could be promising intermediate phenotype candidates for psychotic disorders, but future multimodal neuroimaging studies in schizophrenia and NSNAP patients and their unaffected first-degree relatives are needed to answer fundamental transnosologic questions.",Intermediate phenotype| MRI| NSNAP| Nonschizophrenic nonaffective psychoses| Primary motor abnormalities| Schizophrenia,Non-systematic-review,1,0
185,31706919,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,The role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and inwardly rectifying potassium (Kir) channels in sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP).,"Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is the major cause of death that affects patients with epilepsy. The risk of SUDEP increases according to the frequency and severity of uncontrolled seizures; therefore, SUDEP risk is higher in patients with refractory epilepsy (RE), in whom most antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are ineffective for both seizure control and SUDEP prevention. Consequently, RE and SUDEP share a multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype, which is mainly associated with brain overexpression of ABC-transporters such as P-glycoprotein (P-gp). The activity of P-gp can also contribute to membrane depolarization and affect the normal function of neurons and cardiomyocytes. Other molecular regulators of membrane potential are the inwardly rectifying potassium channels (Kir), whose genetic variants have been related to both epilepsy and heart dysfunctions. Although it has been suggested that dysfunctions of the cardiac, respiratory, and brainstem arousal systems are the causes of SUDEP, the molecular basis for explaining its dysfunctions remain unknown. In rats, repetitive seizures or status epilepticus induced high expression of P-gp and loss Kir expression in the brain and heart, and promoted membrane depolarization, malignant bradycardia, and the high rate of mortality. Here we reviewed clinical and experimental evidences suggesting that abnormal expression of depolarizing/repolarizing factors as P-gp and Kir could favor persistent depolarization of membranes without any rapid functional recovery capacity. This condition induced by convulsive stress could be the molecular mechanism leading to acquired severe bradycardia, as an ineffective heart response generating the appropriate scenario for SUDEP development.

187,33139210,Current problems in pediatric and adolescent health care,Nocturnal events in children: When and how to evaluate.,"Nocturnal events of wide variety and concern are frequently reported by patients and their caregivers. To evaluate suspected abnormal events, primary care physicians must first be familiar with normal behaviors, movements and breathing patterns. Abnormal nocturnal events can then be categorized as nocturnal seizure, parasomnia, sleep-related movement disorder or sleep-related breathing disorder. Diagnoses in the above categories can be made clinically; however, it is important to know when to refer for additional evaluation. Comprehensive literature review was undertaken of nocturnal and sleep-related disorders. This guide reviews nocturnal seizures, normal and abnormal nonepileptic movements and behaviors, discusses broad indications for referral for electroencephalography (EEG) or polysomnography (PSG), and guides counseling and management for patients and their families, ultimately aiding in interpretation of both findings and prognosis. Epilepsy syndromes can result in seizures during sleep or adjacent periods of wakefulness. Parasomnias and sleep-related movement disorders tend to also occur in childhood and may be distinguished clinically. Referral to additional specialists for specific studies including EEG or PSG can be necessary, while other times a knowledgeable and vigilant clinician can contribute to a prompt diagnosis based on clinical features. Nocturnal events often can be managed with parental reassurance and watchful waiting, but treatment or evaluation may be needed. Sleep-related breathing disorders are important to recognize as they present very differently in children than in adults and early intervention can be life-saving. This review should allow both primary and subspecialty non-neurologic pediatric and adolescent health care providers to better utilize EEG and PSG as part of a larger comprehensive clinical approach, distinguishing and managing both epileptic and nonepileptic nocturnal disorders of concern while fostering communication across providers to facilitate and coordinate better holistic long-term care of pediatric and adolescent patients.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

As manifold as the terminology of syringomyelia are the hypotheses of the etiology. Nowadays with MRI without and with gadolinium it is possible to recognize intramedullar cavities safely, the MR especially the cine-MR provides information on pathophysiological details of the flow and intracavitary pressure dependent pulsations of the CSF. Animal models and the findings of own experimental studies have enabled us to study a form of syringomyelia which very closely resembles that brought about by dysrhaphic malformations in the human being and to examine the effectiveness of certain types of surgical therapy. In this paper the term syringomyelia is only used for dysrhaphic cavities in the medulla. After our experience with 61 patients with syringomyelia now we perform the operative decompression of the craniocervical transition as the first step in the operative treatment of the progressive syringomyelia combined with severe craniocervical malformations.

189,29802210,"Clinical science (London, England : 1979)",Neuroprotection via AT2 receptor agonists in ischemic stroke.,"Stroke is a devastating disease that afflicts millions of people each year worldwide. Ischemic stroke, which accounts for ~88% of cases, occurs when blood supply to the brain is decreased, often because of thromboembolism or atherosclerotic occlusion. This deprives the brain of oxygen and nutrients, causing immediate, irreversible necrosis within the core of the ischemic area, but more delayed and potentially reversible neuronal damage in the surrounding brain tissue, the penumbra. The only currently approved therapies for ischemic stroke, the thrombolytic agent recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) and the endovascular clot retrieval/destruction processes, are aimed at restoring blood flow to the infarcted area, but are only available for a minority of patients and are not able in most cases to completely restore neurological deficits. Consequently, there remains a need for agents that will protect neurones against death following ischemic stroke. Here, we evaluate angiotensin II (Ang II) type 2 (AT2) receptor agonists as a possible therapeutic target for this disease. We first provide an overview of stroke epidemiology, pathophysiology, and currently approved therapies. We next review the large amount of preclinical evidence, accumulated over the past decade and a half, which indicates that AT2 receptor agonists exert significant neuroprotective effects in various animal models, and discuss the potential mechanisms involved. Finally, after discussing the challenges of delivering blood-brain barrier (BBB) impermeable AT2 receptor agonists to the infarcted areas of the brain, we summarize the evidence for and against the development of these agents as a promising therapeutic strategy for ischemic stroke.",AT2 receptor| Angiotensin| Stroke| cerebral ischemia,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Based on the literature and our earlier findings, we believe that the impairments of overall (not emotion specific) facial expression recognition is associated with a more general, non-specific psychiatric distress. Thus, first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with SCL-90 global severity index (GSI). Our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the BECK Depression Inventory (BDI).	One hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study. We used a 'Virtual Human' for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions. Subjects filled in the BDI and SCL-90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task.	Significant negative association was found between the GSI of SCL-90 and the overall facial expression recognition. Furthermore, significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the BDI questionnaire and the SCL-90 depression subscale.	The negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the GSI score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis, which states that the impairment of not emotion specific, overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress. Our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on BDI could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate. Abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients. Consequently, we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0
193,27356602,Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),Misregulation of iron homeostasis in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"Iron is essential for all mammalian cells, but it is toxic in excess. Our understanding of molecular mechanisms ensuring iron homeostasis at both cellular and systemic levels has dramatically increased over the past 15 years. However, despite major advances in this field, homeostatic regulation of iron in the central nervous system (CNS) requires elucidation. It is unclear how iron moves in the CNS and how its transfer to the CNS across the blood-brain and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barriers, which separate the CNS from the systemic circulation, is regulated. Increasing evidence indicates the role of iron dysregulation in neuronal cell death observed in neurodegenerative diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). ALS is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by selective cortical czynand spinal motor neuron dysfunction that results from a complex interplay among various pathogenic factors including oxidative stress. The latter is known to strongly affect cellular iron balance, creating a vicious circle to exacerbate oxidative injury. The role of iron in the pathogenesis of ALS is confirmed by therapeutic effects of iron chelation in ALS mouse models. These models are of great importance for deciphering molecular mechanisms of iron accumulation in neurons. Most of them consist of transgenic rodents overexpressing the mutated human superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Mutations in the SOD1 gene constitute one of the most common genetic causes of the inherited form of ALS. However, it should be considered that overexpression of the SOD1 gene usually leads to increased SOD1 enzymatic activity, a condition which does not occur in human pathology and which may itself change the expression of iron metabolism genes.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Psychopathology, medical management and dental implications.","Major depressive disorder, or MDD, is a psychiatric illness in which mood, thoughts and behavioral patterns are impaired for long periods. The illness distresses the person and impairs his or her social functioning and quality of life. MDD is characterized by marked sadness or a loss of interest or pleasure in daily activities, and is accompanied by weight change, sleep disturbance, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, physical impairment and a high suicide rate. In 2000, the World Health Organization, or WHO, identified MDD as the fourth ranked cause of disability and premature death in the world. WHO projected that by 2020, MDD would rise in disease burden to be second only to ischemic heart disease. The disorder is common in the United States, with a lifetime prevalence rate of 17 percent and a recurrence rate of more than 50 percent.	MDD may be associated with extensive dental disease, and people may seek dental treatment before becoming aware of their psychiatric illness. MDD frequently is associated with a disinterest in performing appropriate oral hygiene techniques, a cariogenic diet, diminished salivary flow, rampant dental caries, advanced periodontal disease and oral dysesthesias. Many medications used to treat the disease magnify the xerostomia and increase the incidence of dental disease. Appropriate dental management requires a vigorous dental education program, the use of saliva substitutes and anticaries agents containing fluoride, and special precautions when prescribing or administering analgesics and local anesthetics.

The latter is responsible for the steadily increasing disability in many patients, and there is an urgent need for novel therapies that protect nervous system tissue and enhance axonal growth and/or remyelination. As outlined in this review, solid pre-clinical data suggest neutralization of the neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A as a potential new way to achieve both axonal and myelin repair.

Outcomes showed that both EA preconditioning and regular intervention could relieve CI by reducing toxicity of excitatory amino acids (glutamate, aspartate) and TLR4/NF-κB-mediated inflammatory cascade reaction to relieve inflammatory injury. Moreover, EA preconditioning also could suppress the expression of pro-apoptosis genes and proteins to relieve apoptosis, regulate activation of microglia, and down-regulate the expression of blood brain barrier integrity-related matrix metalloprotein 9. Regular EA intervention also could promote angiogenesis to increase supply of blood and oxygen, facilitate regeneration, proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells via triggering activation of Notch and Shh signaling pathways, and promote the secretion of neurotrophin by up-regulating the expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor and nerve growth factor /Trk A receptor, and promote expression of axon growth and synaptic remodeling-related factor (Ephrin B2/Eph B2) and sr-GTPase activating protein 1 and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42, axon growth and orientated down-stream molecules).

A meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of schizophrenia risk is a critical goal in the field. Endophenotypes in children to relatives of affected individuals may contribute to this early detection. One of the lowest cost and longest theorized domains is motor development in children. METHODS: A meta-analysis was conducted comparing individuals ≤21 years old with affected first-degree relatives (FDR) with (1) individuals from unaffected families (controls), or (2) individuals with FDR having other psychiatric disorders. Studies were classified by motor outcome and separate meta-analyses were performed across six correlated domains, with available N varying by domain. RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were met by k = 23 independent studies with a total N = 18,582, and N across domains varying from 167 to 8619. The youth from affected families had delays in gross and fine motor development in infancy (k = 3, n = 167, Hedges'g = 0.644, confidence intervals (CI) = [0.328, 0.960], p < .001), walking milestones (k = 3, n = 608, g = 0.444, CI = [0.108, 0.780], p = .01), coordination (k = 8, n = 8619, g = 0.625, CI = [0.453, 0.797], p < .0001), and had more abnormal movements such as involuntary movements (k = 6, n = 8365, g = 0.291, CI = [0.041, 0.542], p = .02) compared with controls. However, not all effects survived correction for publication bias. Effects for neurological soft signs were small and not reliably different from zero (k = 4, n = 548, g = 0.238, CI = [-0.106, 0.583], p = .18). When comparing the FDR group to youth from families with other psychiatric disorders, the FDR group was distinguished by poorer gross and fine motor skills (k = 2, n = 275, g = 0.847, CI = [0.393, 1.300], p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Motor deficits during development likely represent an endophenotype for schizophrenia, although its specificity is limited in relation to other serious mental disorders. It holds promise as a low cost domain for early risk detection, although it will have to be combined with other indicators to achieve clinically usable prediction accuracy.

However, while the understanding of mechanisms underlying autophagy in SCI has progressed, there remain several controversial points: (1) temporal pattern results of autophagic activation after SCI are not consistent across studies; (2) effect of accumulation of autophagosomes due to the blockade or enhancement of autophagic flux is uncertain; (3) overall effect of enhanced autophagy remains undefined, with both beneficial and detrimental outcomes reported in SCI literature. In this review, the temporal pattern of autophagic activation, autophagic flux, autophagic cell death, relationship between autophagy and apoptosis, and pharmacological intervention of autophagy in TSCI (contusion injury, compression injury and hemisection injury) and IRSCI are discussed. Types of SCI and severity appear to contribute to differences in outcomes regarding temporal pattern, flux, and function of autophagy. With future development of specific strategies on autophagy intervention, autophagy may play an important role in improving functional recovery in patients with SCI.",autophagy| flux| function| ischemia-reperfusion spinal cord injury| temporal pattern| traumatic spinal cord injury,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Alzheimer published his now famous case study only 110 years ago, and our modern understanding of the disease that bears his name, and its neuropsychological consequences, really only began to accelerate in the 1980s. Since then we have witnessed an explosion of basic and translational research into the causes, characterizations, and possible treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias. We review this lineage of work beginning with Alzheimer's own writings and drawings, then jump to the modern era beginning in the 1970s and early 1980s and provide a sampling of neuropsychological and other contextual work from each ensuing decade. During the 1980s our field began its foundational studies of profiling the neuropsychological deficits associated with AD and its differentiation from other dementias (e.g., cortical vs. subcortical dementias). The 1990s continued these efforts and began to identify the specific cognitive mechanisms affected by various neuropathologic substrates. The 2000s ushered in a focus on the study of prodromal stages of neurodegenerative disease before the full-blown dementia syndrome (i.e., mild cognitive impairment). The current decade has seen the rise of imaging and other biomarkers to characterize preclinical disease before the development of significant cognitive decline. Finally, we suggest future directions and predictions for dementia-related research and potential therapeutic interventions.

207,12697002,CNS drugs,The triptan formulations : how to match patients and products.,"The 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists (the 'triptans') are migraine-specific agents that have revolutionised the treatment of migraine. They are usually the drugs of choice to treat a migraine attack in progress. Different triptans are available in various strengths and formulations, including oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets, nasal sprays and subcutaneous injections. In Europe, sumatriptan is also available as a suppository. Specific differences among the triptans exist, as evidenced by different pharmacological profiles including half-life, time to peak plasma concentrations, peak plasma concentrations, area under the concentration-time curve, metabolism and drug-drug interaction profiles. How or whether these differences translate to clinical efficacy and tolerability advantages for one agent over another is not well differentiated. However, delivery systems may play an important role in onset of action. Given that the clinical distinctions among these agents are subtle, identification of the most appropriate triptan for an individual patient requires consideration of the specific characteristics of the patient and knowledge of patient preference, an accurate history of the efficacy of previous acute-care medications and individual features of the drug being considered. The selection of an acute antimigraine drug also depends upon the stratification of the patient's migraine attack by peak intensity, time to peak intensity, level of associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting, time to associated symptoms, comorbid diseases and concomitant treatments that might cause drug-drug interactions. Individual patient response to the triptans seems to be idiosyncratic and possibly genetically determined. Therefore, a set of specific questions can be used to determine whether a currently used triptan is optimally effective, whether the dose needs to be increased or whether another triptan should be tried. The clinician has in his/her armamentarium an ever-expanding variety of triptans, available in multiple formulations and dosages, which have good safety and tolerability profiles. Continued clinical use will yield familiarity with the various triptans, and it should become possible for the interested physician to match individual patient needs with the specific characteristics of a triptan to optimise therapeutic benefit. Use of the methods outlined in this review in choosing a triptan for an individual patient is probably more likely to lead to migraine relief than making an educated guess as to which triptan is most appropriate.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

210,30658131,Brain research bulletin,Cerebral malaria.,"Malaria remains of significant public health concern under the tropics, causing millions of deaths annually. The disease is caused by protozoans of the Plasmodium genus, of which harbors several distinct species. Human infection occurs during the blood meal of an infected female mosquito belonging to the Anopheles genus. It is estimated that around 1% of children infected with Plasmodium falciparum develops a more severe form of malaria, which may eventually lead to cerebral complications including cerebral malaria (CM). CM can be positively diagnosed in patients unable to localize a painful stimulus, with peripheral asexual P. falciparum parasitemia and no other identifiable causes of an encephalopathy. Unarousable comas along with the presence of asexual forms of the parasite on a peripheral blood smear are hallmarks of the disease. While the molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of CM have yet be fully elucidated, the pathology in itself indicates a clear disease of the vascular endothelium. It is characterized by parasite sequestration, inflammatory cytokine production and vascular leakage, eventually resulting in brain hypoxia. The condition requires systemic health management consisting of focused nursing practices, supportive care, and anti-malarial drugs. The continued understanding of pathogenic mechanisms leading to the onset of CM is fundamental and key for the expansion and development of appropriate neuroprotective interventions. Future research perspectives may also include the development of field-based and rapid diagnostic tests for CM, understanding of host-pathogen interactions to advance development of prevention tools and therapies, and antimalarial drug trials.",Cerebral malaria| Plasmodium falciparum| Tropical neurology,Non-systematic-review,1,0

An Expected Utility Inspired Approach To Shared decision-making For Supratentorial Ischemic Stroke.,"Patients with large territorial supratentorial infarctions are at high risk of cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, tissue herniation and death. There is strong evidence supporting prompt decompressive craniectomy after large hemispheric ischemic stroke as a means to reduce mortality. Nevertheless, functional outcomes can vary significantly. Clinical trials have traditionally judged these outcomes by a priori dichotomization without taking into account individual patient and caregiver preferences. If these are not incorporated into shared decision-making, there are significant risks in both directions, i.e. producing outcomes that may be judged as unacceptable to survivors, or not offering life-saving treatments to patients that according to their own values could be beneficial. In the absence of decision aids, we explore insights from decision theory and propose an expected utility-inspired approach as a supplementary navigating tool in the decision-making process. Four patient case scenarios are discussed as a demonstration of using individualized rankings of outcome preferences, and deriving expected utilities for interventions such as decompressive craniectomy versus medical therapy. The ultimate aim of the suggested approach is to assure that patient values are elicited and incorporated, and possible range and nature of outcomes are discussed, and by attempting to connect best available means to patient individualized ends.",Decision-making| Decompressive craniectomy| Expected utility| Hemispheric stroke| Modified Rankin,Non-systematic-review,1,0

Throughout history, liver transplantation for this population has been controversial, and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol. In recent years, the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcohol-associated liver disease have increased dramatically; however, disparities persist. For instance, many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing, such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use, are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder. In addition, few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder, and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment. Finally, current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction, which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years. As we look toward the future, we must emphasize the use of evidence-based measures in selecting patients for listing, ensure access to high-quality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant, and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs. We believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

The main symptoms of AS are severe impairment in social interaction and communication, and restricted interests, without significant delay in cognitive and language development. Its prevalence is not clearly established but might be around 0.26 per 1000. Symptoms of high-functioning autism (HFA), which is not an official diagnostic category, are quite similar. Children and adolescents with AS or HFA mostly have a social skills deficit, in connection with a lack of understanding concerning the rules governing social interactions. This deficit often leads to social isolation and peer rejection, which can alter their quality of life. Their lack of social skills can also have effects on success at school or work, integration among peers and mental health. According to recent guidelines of the French national authority for health (Haute autorité de santé, HAS) about the special needs of persons with PDD, professionals have to develop evidence-based interventions, emphasizing social interactions and participation, as described by the international classification of functioning, disability and health (ICF): social and professional participation as well as participation in leisure activities, clubs and societies, etc.	To explore the studies that give evidence of the value of these social skills training groups, to review the methods and programs worked out in these groups, and to highlight the best general operating principles to be adopted and combined.	Systematic searches of electronic databases, journals, and reference lists identified 12 studies published since 1984, involving social competence group interventions, led by psychotherapists who were trained in cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT), for children and adolescents from 6 to 18years old with a diagnosis of AS or HFA.	According to these 12 studies, these interventions are useful and significantly effective. Adaptation of their contents and educational means to how children and adolescents with AS function is necessary to facilitate learning and decrease anxiety. Concerning the groups' setting, most of these studies insist on the value of working with a small number of participants and creating a friendly, predictable and structured environment (even the progress of the sessions itself has to be structured). The programs' contents should ally didactic teaching and training exercises, which should be diverse and adapted to the objectives. The techniques usually applied in CBT (role plays, modeling, problem-solving strategies, etc.), must be completed with strategies known to be appropriate for children and adolescents with ASD, such as social scenarios.	Although new studies are necessary to assess the generalization and long-term efficacy of such approaches, this review confirms the advantages of the main methods of social skills training groups for children and adolescents with AS. It opens up perspectives to developing new programs of social skills training groups, integrating various approaches, dimensions and objectives, working on a long-term basis.",,Non-systematic-review,1,0

However, it remains unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive training facilitates cortical activity and further influences cognitive function after stroke. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effects of 2 hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on neuroplastic changes and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline. METHODS: This study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Stroke survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) sequential exercise-cognitive training (SEQ), (2) dual-task exercise-cognitive training (DUAL), or (3) control group (CON). All groups underwent training 60 min per day, 3 days per week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary behavioral outcomes included cognitive and physical functions. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of training, patients in the SEQ group (n = 21) exhibited increased RS FC between the left occipital lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus with right parietal lobe, compared to the DUAL (n = 22) and CON (n = 20) groups. Additionally, patients in the DUAL group showed increased FC of the left temporal lobe. However, changes in behavioral outcome measures were non-significant among the 3 groups (all P's > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the distinct neuroplastic mechanisms associated with 2 types of exercise-cognitive hybridized trainings. The pre-post functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements illustrated the time course of neural mechanisms for cognitive recovery in stroke survivors following different exercise-cognitive training approaches.

230,475542,Archives of general psychiatry,A comparative trial of home and hospital psychiatric care. One-year follow-up,"The effectiveness of community-based treatment stressing home care was compared with hospital-based psychiatric care. One hundred and fifty-five patients destined for inpatient psychiatric care were randomly assigned to Home Care (76 patients) and to Hospital Care (79 patients). Symptoms, role functioning, and psychosocial burden on the family were similar at admission, one month, three months, six months, and one year. The mean in-hospital stay of Hospital Care patients was 41.7 days compared with a mean stay of 14.5 days for Home Care patients. The difference in the amount of ambulatory care received by patients in the two groups was not significant. The evidence is consistent: community-based psychiatric care is an effective alternative to hospital-based care for many but not all severely disabled patients.

METHOD: This study was a three-group, repeated-measures design with random assignment to treatment group. Forty-five nursing home residents with moderate to severe AD were randomly assigned to a 16-week programme of comprehensive exercise, supervised walking or social conversation. Raters were blinded to treatment group assignment. Major outcome variables were depression measured by the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, mood measured by the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and the Alzheimer's Mood Scale, and affect measured by the Observed Affect Scale. Depression was reduced in all three groups with some evidence of superior benefit from exercise. Depression is a common problem with serious and costly consequences for nursing home residents with AD. Exercise as a behavioural approach to treatment of depression in nursing home residents with severe AD evidenced a clear benefit to participants in this study.

233,25242806,Parkinsonism & related disorders,Effects of cognitive training in Parkinson's disease: a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: In Parkinson's Disease (PD), cognitive dysfunctions which can reduce patients' quality of life occur frequently. Data on non-pharmacological intervention effects on cognitive functions in patients with PD are rare. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different cognitive group trainings (structured vs. unstructured) on cognition, depression, and quality of life in non-demented PD patients. METHODS: In this randomized controlled trial, 65 non-demented patients with PD according to UK Brain Bank criteria (Hoehn & Yahr I-III) were allocated to one of two cognitive multi-component treatments (""NEUROvitalis"", a structured training, or the unstructured training ""Mentally fit"" with randomly assembled cognitive tasks, each including 12 group-sessions à 90 min over 6 weeks) or a waiting list control group (CG). A neuropsychological test battery was performed before and after the training. RESULTS: Compared to the CG, patients from the ""NEUROvitalis"" group improved in short-term memory (word list learning ""Memo"": p < .01) and working memory (digit span reverse from ""DemTect"": p < .05), whereas depression scores where reduced in the ""Mentally fit"" group (Beck Depression Inventory-II: p < .05). The ""NEUROvitalis"" group improved significantly more in working memory than the ""Mentally fit"" group (DemTect: p < .05). DISCUSSION: Cognitive and affective functions can be improved by cognitive trainings in PD patients. Specific effects (e.g. on memory and working memory versus depression) seem to be dependent on the type of training. Further research is needed to define long-term effects and the efficacy in PD patients with different extent of cognitive and neuropsychiatric symptoms.",Cognitive training| Depression| Intervention| Parkinson's disease,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The present study aimed to examine the effects of a self-applied computerized program based on SSL that maintains the same objectives and contents as the face-to-face program.	In this randomized controlled study, 75 children (49.3 % female) aged 8-12 years (Mage = 9.45, SD = 1.31), selected for exhibiting emotional symptoms, were randomly assigned to either the intervention (n = 35) or the waiting list control (WLC) group (n = 40). Pre- and post-intervention data were collected through self-reports and the report of parents who completed parallel versions of the same measures of emotional and behavioral problems.	Overall, compared to the WLC group, the intervention group showed positive effects on targeted emotional symptomatology in the short term. Based on parents' reports, a significant reduction was found in outcomes such as anxiety, depression, emotional symptoms, and internalizing problems, while self-reported results were similar except for anxiety. In addition, a positive impact was found on symptoms related to other types of difficulties (e.g., externalizing problems and general difficulties measured).	Small sample size, non-inclusion of follow-up assessment and other informants (e.g., teachers).	In conclusion, this research provides novel and promising data on the self-applied computerized adapted version of the SSL program, within a multi-informant approach, suggesting that it may be a useful tool for the indicated prevention of childhood emotional problems.",Children| Emotional problems| Indicated prevention| Self-applied computerized intervention| Super Skills for Life,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Other partner dances may be more suitable and preferable for those with Parkinson's disease. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of tango, waltz/foxtrot and no intervention on functional motor control in individuals with Parkinson's disease.	This study employed a randomized, between- notsubject, prospective, repeated measures design.	Fifty-eight people with mild-moderate Parkinson's disease participated.	Participants were randomly assigned to tango, waltz/foxtrot or no intervention (control) groups. Those in the dance groups attended 1-h classes twice a week, completing 20 lessons in 13 weeks. Balance, functional mobility, forward and backward walking were evaluated before and after the intervention.	Both dance groups improved more than the control group, which did not improve. The tango and waltz/foxtrot groups improved significantly on the Berg Balance Scale, 6-minute walk distance, and backward stride length. The tango group improved as much or more than those in the waltz/foxtrot group on several measures.	Tango may target deficits associated with Parkinson's disease more than waltz/foxtrot, but both dances may benefit balance and locomotion.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Controversy exists about whether open microsurgical methods serve to reduce shunt dependency compared with endovascular techniques.	To determine predictors of shunt-dependent hydrocephalus and functional outcomes after aneurysmal SAH.	A total of 471 patients who were part of a prospective, randomized, controlled trial from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. All variables including demographic data, medical history, treatment, imaging, and functional outcomes were included as part of the trial. No additional variables were retrospectively collected.	Ultimately, 147 patients (31.2%) required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) in our series. Age, dissecting aneurysm type, ruptured vertebrobasilar aneurysm, Fisher grade, Hunt and Hess grade, admission intraventricular hemorrhage, admission intraparenchymal hemorrhage, blood in the fourth ventricle on admission, perioperative ventriculostomy, and hemicraniectomy were significant risk factors (P < .05) associated with shunt-dependent hydrocephalus on univariate analysis. On multivariate analysis, intraventricular hemorrhage and intraparenchymal hemorrhage were independent risk factors for shunt dependency (P < .05). Clipping vs coiling treatment was not statistically associated with VPS after SAH on both univariate and multivariate analyses. Patients who did not receive a VPS at discharge had higher Glasgow Outcome Scale and Barthel Index scores and were more likely to be functionally independent and to return to work 72 months after surgery (P < .05).	There is no difference in shunt dependency after SAH among patients treated by endovascular or microsurgical means. Patients in whom shunt-dependent hydrocephalus does not develop after SAH tend to have improved long-term functional outcomes.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

While animal-assisted therapy (AAT) can benefit physical function in older adults and improve symptoms of psychotic disorders, the effect of AAT on middle-aged patients with schizophrenia is unclear. The current randomized controlled trial aimed to explore the efficacy of AAT for middle-aged patients with schizophrenia. Forty participants were randomly assigned to either the AAT or control group. The AAT group participated in one-hour sessions with dog-assisted group activities once a week for 12 weeks. The controls participated in dose-matched, non-animal-related recreational activities. Both groups remained on their usual psychotropic medication during the trial. Evaluations included the Chair Stand Test (CST), Timed Up-and-Go (TUG) test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 5-Meter walk test (5MWT), and Assessment of Communication and Interaction Skills (ACIS). The increases in CST repetitions and ACIS scores were larger in the AAT group than in the controls. The two groups did not differ significantly in MoCA scores, TUG performance, or the 5MWT. The AAT group showed a greater increase in lower extremity strength and social skills, but no improvement in cognitive function, agility, or mobility. Further research with more sensitive evaluations and longer follow-up is needed.",aging| animal-assisted therapy (AAT)| physical function| schizophrenia| social function,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

There is a lack of research on this matter. AIM: The aim was to investigate, in a group of severely mentally ill persons, whether the use of a simple communication tool could influence the sense of empowerment, satisfaction with care, therapeutic alliance and unmet needs. METHOD: The study had a cluster randomized design. The intervention was a communication tool (2-COM) applied in two teams during one year. In a comparison group of two other teams, the treatment was as usual. At baseline, after six months, and after one year, assessments were made. RESULTS: After one year the 2-COM groups seemed to have a larger reduction in unmet needs compared to the treatment-as-usual group. However, there were large problems with attrition in the study, and it was not possible to draw relevant conclusions. CONCLUSIONS: The methodological problems were substantial, and the study may be considered as a pilot study.

FindMyApps is a tablet intervention consisting of a selection tool to help people with dementia find usable apps for self-management and meaningful activities, including training to support informal carers in employing errorless learning principles to help people with dementia learn tablet and tool usage.	We conducted an exploratory, pilot randomized controlled trial with a mixed-methods design. Twenty persons with mild dementia and carer dyads were randomly assigned to the FindMyApps group (n = 10), receiving either the FindMyApps training and selection tool, or a control condition (n = 10), receiving only a short tablet training. Pre- and post-test measurements at a three month follow-up, consisted of questionnaires and post-test semi-structured interviews.	The FindMyApps tool was mostly perceived as useful and easy to use. Persons with dementia were generally able to learn how to use the tool, though they regularly needed support from informal carers. Persons with dementia found apps through the tool, which they used regularly. Persons with dementia and informal carers were positive about the training and support they received. No significant differences were found on outcome measures of persons with dementia, but based on effect sizes FindMyApps is a promising intervention.	Qualitative results indicate that the FindMyApps intervention has the potential to positively influence the self-management abilities and engagement in meaningful activities of people with dementia. Remarks are made to improve the intervention and recommendations are given for future effectiveness studies.Implications for rehabilitationThe person-centred tablet intervention FindMyApps has the potential to positively influence the self-management and engagement in meaningful activities in people with dementia.Based on the input of persons with dementia and informal carers, the FindMyApps intervention and study procedure will be further improved and evaluated in terms of effectiveness in an RCT.",Dementia| meaningful activities| randomized controlled feasibility study| self-management| tablet computers,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
241,1737074,Biological psychiatry,Controlled trial of bright light for nonseasonal major depressive disorders,"Psychotropic drug-free hospitalized veterans with nonseasonal major depressive disorders or depressed forms of bipolar disorder were treated with light for 1 week. Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to bright white light treatment (2000-3000 lux), and 26 patients were randomized to dim red light placebo control treatment. Unlike those treated with dim red light, those treated with bright white light showed declines in three measures of depression during treatment. Partial relapse appeared within 2 days. A global depression score showed a statistically significant (p = 0.02) difference favoring bright white light treatment. Two bright-light-treated patients became mildly hypomanic, but side effects were mild. Improvement was not correlated with patient expectations; indeed, patients expected somewhat greater benefit from the placebo. Patients treated in summer responded as well as those treated in winter. Baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stage data (e.g., rapid eye movement; REM latency) did not predict treatment responses. These 1-week treatment results suggest that bright light might produce benefits for patients with nonseasonal depression.

242,18245417,Pediatrics,Improving child and parent mental health in primary care: a cluster-randomized trial of communication skills training,"OBJECTIVE: We examined child and parent outcomes of training providers to engage families efficiently and to reduce common symptoms of a range of mental health problems and disorders. METHODS: Training involved three 1-hour discussions structured around video examples of family/provider communication skills, each followed by practice with standardized patients and self-evaluation. Skills targeted eliciting parent and child concerns, partnering with families, and increasing expectations that treatment would be helpful. We tested the training with providers at 13 sites in rural New York, urban Maryland, and Washington, DC. Children (5-16 years of age) making routine visits were enrolled if they screened ""possible"" or ""probable"" for mental disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or if their provider said they were likely to have an emotional or behavioral problem. Children and their parents were then monitored for 6 months, to assess changes in parent-rated symptoms and impairment and parent symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-eight providers (31 trained and 27 control) and 418 children (248 patients of trained providers and 170 patients of control providers) participated. Among the children, 72% were in the possible or probable categories. Approximately one half (54%) were white, 30% black, 12% Latino, and 4% other ethnicities. Eighty-eight percent (367 children) completed follow-up monitoring. At 6 months, minority children cared for by trained providers had greater reduction in impairment (-0.91 points) than did those cared for by control providers but no greater reduction in symptoms. Seeing a trained provider did not have an impact on symptoms or impairment among white children. Parents of children cared for by trained providers experienced greater reduction in symptoms (-1.7 points) than did those cared for by control providers. CONCLUSION: Brief provider communication training had a positive impact on parent mental health symptoms and reduced minority children's impairment across a range of problems.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

DESIGN: Proof-of-concept, parallel group RCT design. SETTING: Regional burn center. PARTICIPANTS: Acutely injured, hospitalized adult survivors of burn injury (N=50) were randomly assigned to SMART (n=28) or nondirective supportive psychotherapy (n=22). Due to dropout and missing data, final sample size was 40, SMART (n=21) and nondirective supportive psychotherapy (n=19). INTERVENTIONS: SMART is a manualized, 4-session cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychological intervention targeting ASD, PTSD, and MDD symptoms. NDSP is a manualized, 4-session protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Davidson Trauma Scale ([DTS]; diagnostic proxy for ASD and PTSD; clinical cutoff=40, with higher score=higher severity) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ([PHQ-9]; diagnostic proxy for MDD; clinical cutoff=10, with higher score=higher severity) at pretreatment, immediate posttreatment, and 1 month posttreatment. RESULTS: At baseline, median DTS scores and PHQ-9 scores were above clinical cutoffs and did not differ across groups. At 1 week and 1 month posttreatment, median DTS and PHQ-9 scores were beneath clinical cutoffs in the SMART group; scores remained above clinical cutoffs in the NDSP group at these time points. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to conduct an RCT of SMART in hospitalized adult survivors of burn injury. SMART has the potential to yield clinically significant outcomes.

Useful data were available for the other 10 children. Of the long-term survivors 74 had received routine, and 84 had received intensive nursery care. At eight years of age there were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of a variety of individual abnormalities; fewer of the intensively managed children had cerebral palsy, but sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities occurred more frequently. Individual children were graded into four carefully defined groups: (a) profound handicap (4.4 per cent of entire study group); (b) severe handicap (10.1 per cent); (c) significant handicap (37.3 per cent); and (d) trivial or no handicap (41.8 per cent).

Therefore, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on sexual function and intimacy among older adult WWE in Iran. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at 15 neurology clinics in three Iranian cities. WWE together with their partners and healthcare providers were randomly assigned in patient and partner (PP; n = 220), patient, partner, and healthcare provider (PPHP; n = 220), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 220) group. WWE and their partners in both the PP and PPHP groups received eight weeks of MBCT-S sessions. In the PPHP group, three individual sessions on sexual counseling were added for healthcare providers. Self-assessment scales were used at baseline, one month and six months after completing the intervention. Mixed linear regression models were developed to determine differences among the three groups. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to understand the mediating effects of mindfulness, intimacy, patient-physicians relationship and sexual counseling barriers. RESULTS: Improvements in sexual function, sexual distress, and intimacy were found in both the PP and PPHP groups at one-month and six-month follow-ups. The PPHP group compared with the PP group had greater improvement in intimacy at both follow-ups. Regarding sexual function, the PPHP group performed better than the PP group at the six-month follow-up.

METHOD: Inpatients with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed, treatment-resistant bipolar depression, who were acutely admitted to 1 of the 7 clinical study centers in Norway, were recruited from May 2008 to April 2011 into a prospective, randomized controlled, 6-week acute treatment trial. General neurocognitive function was assessed with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), and retrograde memory for autobiographical events was assessed with the Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form (AMI-SF) before and shortly after (mean = 23.5 days) a trial with either RUL brief-pulse ECT (mean dose = 233.3 mC) or APT. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients entered, and 39 (nECT = 19, nAPT = 20) completed. Both groups showed improvements in all MCCB domain scores, with no significant differences between the study groups (no interaction effect: F₁,₃₇ = 1.52, P = NS). Improvements in neurocognitive performance were significantly correlated with reductions in depression ratings posttreatment. The AMI-SF score was significantly lower (based on consistent answers from pre- to posttreatment) in the ECT group (72.9%) than in the APT group (80.8%, P = .025), indicating reduced consistency in autobiographical memory after ECT. CONCLUSIONS: General neurocognitive function was unaffected by RUL brief-pulse ECT treatment and positively related to improved mood in bipolar depression. Autobiographical memory consistency was reduced in patients treated with ECT. The results suggest that ECT can be used in treatment-resistant bipolar depression without compromising general neurocognitive function. The clinical relevance of reduced autobiographical memory consistency in the ECT group requires further investigation.

In this study, the authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of CBT4CBT as a virtual stand-alone treatment, delivered with minimal clinical monitoring, and clinician-delivered cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) compared with treatment as usual in a heterogeneous sample of treatment-seeking outpatients with substance use disorders.	This was a randomized clinical trial in which 137 individuals who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for current substance abuse or dependence were randomly assigned to receive treatment as usual, weekly individual CBT, or CBT4CBT with brief weekly monitoring.	Rates of treatment exposure differed by group, with the best retention in the CBT4CBT group and the poorest in the individual CBT group. Participants who received CBT or CBT4CBT reduced their frequency of substance use significantly more than those who received treatment as usual. Six-month follow-up outcomes indicated continuing benefit of CBT4CBT (plus monitoring) over treatment as usual, but not for clinician-delivered CBT over treatment as usual. Analysis of secondary outcomes indicated that participants in the CBT4CBT group demonstrated the best learning of cognitive and behavioral concepts, as well as the highest satisfaction with treatment.

250,17516492,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Bright light therapy in Parkinson's disease: a pilot study.,"Several observations suggest a beneficial effect of melatonin antagonism for Parkinson's disease (PD). Although bright light therapy (BLT) suppresses melatonin release and is an established treatment for depression and sleep disturbances, it has not been evaluated in PD. We examined effects of BLT on motor symptoms, depression, and sleep in PD in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind study in 36 PD patients, using Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) I-IV, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale. All patients received BLT for 15 days in the morning, 30 min daily. Illuminance was 7.500 lux in the active treatment group and 950 lux in the placebo group. Although group differences were small, BLT led to significant improvement of tremor, UPDRS I, II, and IV, and depression in the active treatment group but not in the placebo group. It was very well tolerated. Follow up studies in more advanced patient populations employing longer treatment durations are warranted.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 77 community-dwelling individuals with a TBI, and a diagnosis of depression. Participants were randomized into treatment conditions either CBT or SPT and received up to 16 sessions of individual psychotherapy. MEASURES: Participants completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and self-report measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), perceived social support (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List), stressful life events (Life Experiences Survey), and quality of life (QOL) before beginning and immediately following treatment. RESULTS: No significant differences were found at baseline between CBT and SPT groups on demographic factors (sex, age, education, race, and time since injury) or baseline measures of depression, anxiety, participation, perceived social support, stressful life events, or QOL. Analyses of variance revealed significant time effects for the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and QOL outcome measures but no group effects. Intention-to-treat mixed effects analyses did not find any significant difference in patterns of scores of the outcome measures between the CBT and SPT intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both forms of psychotherapy were efficacious in improving diagnoses of depression and anxiety and reducing depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that in this sample of individuals with TBI, CBT was not more effective in treating depression than SPT, though further research is needed with larger sample sizes to identify different components of these interventions that may be effective with different TBI populations.

252,22440072,Behavior therapy,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy improves emotional reactivity to social stress: results from a randomized controlled trial.,"The high likelihood of recurrence in depression is linked to a progressive increase in emotional reactivity to stress (stress sensitization). Mindfulness-based therapies teach mindfulness skills designed to decrease emotional reactivity in the face of negative affect-producing stressors. The primary aim of the current study was to assess whether Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is efficacious in reducing emotional reactivity to social evaluative threat in a clinical sample with recurrent depression. A secondary aim was to assess whether improvement in emotional reactivity mediates improvements in depressive symptoms. Fifty-two individuals with partially remitted depression were randomized into an 8-week MBCT course or a waitlist control condition. All participants underwent the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) before and after the 8-week trial period. Emotional reactivity to stress was assessed with the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory at several time points before, during, and after the stressor. MBCT was associated with decreased emotional reactivity to social stress, specifically during the recovery (post-stressor) phase of the TSST. Waitlist controls showed an increase in anticipatory (pre-stressor) anxiety that was absent in the MBCT group. Improvements in emotional reactivity partially mediated improvements in depressive symptoms. Limitations include small sample size, lack of objective or treatment adherence measures, and non-generalizability to more severely depressed populations. Given that emotional reactivity to stress is an important psychopathological process underlying the chronic and recurrent nature of depression, these findings suggest that mindfulness skills are important in adaptive emotion regulation when coping with stress.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) combined with auditory feedback for trunk control on UE function and activities of daily living among subacute stroke patients with moderate impairment.	Twenty participants with hemiparesis were randomly assigned to either the mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group (n = 10) or the control group (n = 10). The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group received the mCIMT protocol training at the same time as the auditory feedback for control of the compensatory movement of the trunk. The control group only received the mCIMT protocol. Each group underwent 20 (1 hour/day) intervention sessions (5 days/week for 4 weeks).	The mCIMT combined with auditory feedback group exhibited greater changes in the Action Research Arm Test (P = .027; 95% CI .429-6.171), Fugl-Meyer Assessment upper extremity (P = .034; 95% CI .360-8.039), modified Barthel Index (P = .003; 95% CI 3.465-14.536), and amount of use of motor activity log (P = .009; 95% CI .078-.476) compared to the control group. There were no significant differences in the quality of movement (P = .054, 95% CI -.005 to .457) and modified Ashworth Scale (P = .288; 95% CI -.583 to .183) grades between the 2 groups.

There is a need for empirically validated psychotherapy interventions for these patients. Cognitive behavioral social skills training teaches cognitive and behavioral coping techniques, social functioning skills, problem solving, and compensatory aids for neurocognitive impairments. The authors compared treatment as usual with the combination of treatment as usual plus cognitive behavioral social skills training. METHOD: The randomized, controlled trial included 76 middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia, who were assigned to either treatment as usual or combined treatment. Cognitive behavioral social skills training was administered over 24 weekly group sessions. Blind raters assessed social functioning, psychotic and depressive symptoms, cognitive insight, and skill mastery. RESULTS: After treatment, the patients receiving combined treatment performed social functioning activities significantly more frequently than the patients in treatment as usual, although general skill at social functioning activities did not differ significantly. Patients receiving cognitive behavioral social skills training achieved significantly greater cognitive insight, indicating more objectivity in reappraising psychotic symptoms, and demonstrated greater skill mastery. The overall group effect was not significant for symptoms, but the greater increase in cognitive insight with combined treatment was significantly correlated with greater reduction in positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: With cognitive behavioral social skills training, middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia learned coping skills, evaluated anomalous experiences with more objectivity (achieved greater cognitive insight), and improved social functioning. Additional research is needed to determine whether cognitive insight mediates psychotic symptom change in cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD. METHODS: 28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-s train duration, 20-s inter-train interval) for 15 min (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain. Assessments were conducted before, after, and one month following treatment. RESULTS: Participants in the active condition showed a near significant reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms from pre-treatment to one month follow-up, and a significant reduction in social relating symptoms (relative to sham participants) for both post-treatment assessments. Those in the active condition also showed a reduction in self-oriented anxiety during difficult and emotional social situations from pre-treatment to one month follow-up. There were no changes for those in the sham condition. CONCLUSION: Deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex yielded a reduction in social relating impairment and socially-related anxiety. Further research in this area should employ extended rTMS protocols that approximate those used in depression in an attempt to replicate and amplify the clinical response.",Autism spectrum disorder| Deep rTMS| Medial prefrontal cortex| Mentalizing| Social relating,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

At present, this population demonstrates decreased participation in physical activities and sport compared to peers due to barriers ranging from body function to accessibility challenges. Sport provides culturally relevant opportunities for social integration, community participation and physical activity and has been shown to improve the fitness, self-esteem, confidence and quality of life of children with disabilities. The Sports Stars physiotherapy group has been designed to support the development of a range of fundamental movement and sports skills through activity skill practice and participation in modified popular Australian sports.	This randomised, waitlist controlled, assessor blinded, superiority trial with two parallel groups will aim to compare the effectiveness of Sports Stars to standard care across all ICF domains. Children in the Sports Stars group are expected to demonstrate greater improvement in their individually-selected, sports related goals measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure. This study will aim to assess sixty ambulant children aged six to 12 years with a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Children will be excluded if they have had recent Botox or neurological/orthopaedic surgery. The Sports Stars intervention includes eight, one-hour, weekly physiotherapy group sessions with four to six participants and one lead physiotherapist. Outcome measures will be collected pre, post and 12 weeks post the immediate Sports Stars group to assess change immediately after, and at follow up time points.	This will be the first study of its kind to investigate a culturally relevant sports-focussed fundamental movement skills physiotherapy group for ambulant children with cerebral palsy. The findings will add to a growing pool of evidence supporting group physiotherapy for children with cerebral palsy and the Sports Stars group will provide an avenue for children to transition from individual physiotherapy to mainstream and modified recreational and competitive sports.

Cognitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few community-based cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to examine and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome of a cognitive intervention program for older patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. METHODS: Community-dwelling older subjects with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 sessions of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hierarchic Dementia Scale (HDS). RESULTS: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was significant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective and acceptable means in providing cognitive assessment and intervention to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the accessibility of dementia service to the community.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The present study tested a GAD treatment that targeted intolerance of uncertainty, erroneous beliefs about worry, poor problem orientation, and cognitive avoidance. Twenty-six primary GAD patients were randomly allocated to a treatment condition (n = 14) or a delayed treatment control condition (n = 12). Self-report, clinician, and significant other ratings assessed GAD and associated symptoms. The results show that the treatment led to statistically and clinically significant change at posttest and that gains were maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Furthermore, 20 of 26 participants (77%) no longer met GAD diagnostic criteria following treatment. With regard to the treatment's underlying model, the results show that intolerance of uncertainty significantly decreased over treatment and that gains were maintained at both follow-ups.

METHOD: Of 160 patients, 57 were randomly assigned to the control condition and 103 were assigned to the experimental condition. Control patients received standard clinical care. In the experimental condition, day treatment was attempted as soon as the patient's condition permitted. The average number of nights per week that experimental patients spent away from the hospital was compared to the average number of nights away for patients under standard care. RESULTS: Day treatment was satisfactory for 40% of the experimental patients but was completely infeasible for another 40%. The level of surveillance needed in the first week, physical illness, number of previous admissions, depressive symptoms, and treatment by qualified psychiatrists versus registrars were variables predictive of these differences. CONCLUSIONS: In this unselected group of patients, no absolute contraindications against day treatment were found. This suggests that the selection criteria applied in nearly all other controlled studies on the subject were unwarranted.

This study examined predictors of response to 2 interventions delivered to mandated college students (N = 598) using a stepped care approach incorporating a peer-delivered 15-min brief advice (BA) session (Step 1) and a 60- to 90-min brief motivational intervention (BMI) delivered by trained interventionists (Step 2).	Analyses were completed in 2 stages. First, 3 types of variables (screening variables, alcohol-related cognitions, mandated student profile) were examined in a logistic regression model as putative predictors of lower risk drinking (defined as 3 or fewer heavy episodic drinking [HED] episodes and/or 4 or fewer alcohol-related consequences in the past month) 6 weeks following the BA session. Second, we used generalized estimating equations to examine putative moderators of BMI effects on HED and peak blood alcohol content compared with assessment only (AO) control over the 3-, 6-, and 9-month follow-ups.	Participants reporting lower scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, more benefits to changing alcohol use, and those who fit the 'Bad Incident' profile at baseline were more likely to report lower risk drinking 6 weeks after the BA session. Moderation analyses revealed that Bad Incident students who received the BMI reported more HED at 9-month follow-up than those who received AO.

267,31443692,BMC neurology,Remote ischemic conditioning improves cognition in patients with subcortical ischemic vascular dementia.,"Subcortical ischemic vascular dementia (SIVD) is very common among the older people, but has no approved treatment. Preclinical trials show that remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) reduces recurrence of ischemic stroke. We hypothesize that RIC may also be an effective therapy for patients with SIVD.	Thirty-seven consecutive SIVD cases were enrolled in this randomized control study. Eighteen RIC patients underwent five brief cycles of conditioning (bilateral upper limb compression at 200 mmHg) followed by reperfusion twice daily over 6 consecutive months. Nineteen control patients underwent the same process, but at a pressure of 60 mmHg which caused no restriction on the blood flow of the upper limb. The primary outcome measures were changes in neuropsychological assessments. The secondary outcomes included the changes in high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentration, white matter lesion volume (WMLV), diffusion tension imaging (DTI) metrics of white matter. All data were collected at baseline and follow-up.	A significant treatment difference favoring RIC at 6 months was observed on performance of Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Trail Making Test A and B (TMT-A & TMT-B), and Judgment of Line Orientation (JLO) (p < 0.05). The control group did not show much improvement after the treatment, and only with a slight change in HVLT-R and TMT-R (p < 0.05). Covariance analysis of efficacy between the two groups suggested that RIC patients performed better on JLO than control patients at the 6-month follow-up (RIC 23.10 vs. control 18.56; p = 0.013). Although DTI metrics were comparable, Hs-CRP levels and WMLV in RIC patients showed a declining trend.	Over the 6-month treatment period, we found that RIC was safe and effective for improving cognitive function in SIVD patients.

Pharmacotherapy is the standard of care in epilepsy; however, few interventions exist to promote cognitive development and to mitigate disease burden. We aimed to examine the impact of two different modalities of neurofeedback (NFB) on cognitive functioning and quality-of-life (QOL) measurements in children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy. The study also explored the effects of NFB on clinical outcomes and electroencephalography (EEG) quantitative analysis. METHODS: Participants (n = 44) with controlled focal epilepsy were randomized to one of three arms: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) NFB (n = 15), slow cortical potentials (SCP) NFB (n = 16), or sham NFB (n = 13). All participants received 25 sessions of intervention. The attention switching task (AST), Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS), seizure frequency (SF), EEG power spectrum, and coherence were measured at baseline, postintervention, and at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: In children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy, SMR training significantly reduced reaction time in the AST (p = 0.006), and this was correlated with the difference of change for theta power on EEG (p = 0.03); only the SMR group showed a significant decrease in beta coherence (p = 0.03). All groups exhibited improvement in QOL (p = <0.05).

Participants were 18-65 years old and recruited from 17 clinics at 4 different sites to participate in a randomized controlled trial for anxiety disorders, which compared the Coordinated Anxiety Learning and Management (CALM) intervention (consisting of CBT, medication, or both) with usual care. Of those participants who were randomized to the intervention arm and selected CBT (either alone or in combination with medication), 85 were Latino and 251 were non-Latino White; the majority of the Latino participants received the CBT intervention in English (n = 77). Blinded assessments of clinical improvement and functioning were administered at baseline and at 6, 12, and 18 months after baseline. Measures of engagement, including attendance, homework adherence, understanding of CBT principles, and commitment to treatment, were assessed weekly during the CBT intervention.	Findings from propensity-weighted linear and logistic regression models revealed no statistically significant differences between Latinos and non-Latino Whites on symptom measures of clinical improvement and functioning at almost all time points. There were significant differences on 2 of 7 engagement outcomes, namely, number of sessions attended and patients' understanding of CBT principles.	These findings suggest that CBT can be an effective treatment approach for Latinos who are primarily English speaking and likely more acculturated, although continued attention should be directed toward engaging Latinos in such interventions.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

In this work, we present a randomized controlled wait-list trial evaluating 2 different intervention durations (standard = 17 vs brief = 11 sessions) of a cognitive stimulation program developed for older adults with cognitive impairments with or without dementia. 20 participants were randomly assigned to the standard duration intervention program (17 sessions, 1.5 months) or to a wait-list group. At postintervention of the standard intervention group, the wait-list group crossed over to receive the brief intervention program (11 sessions, 1 month). Changes in neuropsychological, functionality, quality of life, and caregiver outcomes were evaluated. Experience during intervention and costs and feasibility were also evaluated. The current cognitive stimulation programs (ie, standard and brief) showed high values of experiential relevance for both intervention durations.

CMHN training and supervision commenced prior to, and continued throughout, the 18-month study.	Patient cognition declined in both groups, but problem behaviour reduced in experimental group families. However this effect was associated with the practice of some, not all, CMHNs. Carer management and mood improved with PSI support. In contrast, by 18 months, families supported by conventional CMHNs reported reduced coping resources, increased problem behaviour and their level of depression worsened. Only two CMHNs adhered to the PSI-protocol.	Some, but not all, 'trained' CMHNs used the PSI to help family carers reduce behavioural problems. A relatively long but not intensive PSI of 12-18 months was needed to moderate carer mood. Dementia-specific practice arrangements, training and sustained clinical supervision are important for the delivery of effective psychosocial interventions in dementia.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
272,6780021,British medical journal (Clinical research ed.),Electric convulsion therapy in depression: a double-blind controlled trial.,"The therapeutic effect of simulated and real bilateral electric convulsion therapy was examined in a double-blind, randomised trial on 22 patients with a primary depressive illness. Each treatment was given twice weekly for three weeks and the results assessed by the psychiatrist using a visual analogue rating scale, nurses using a nine-point rating scale, and the patients themselves using the Beck Depression Inventory. With all three methods of assessment patients given the real treatment substantially improved (p less than 0.001), whereas those given simulated treatment showed little change. Three weeks after substituting real treatment for simulated, however, these patients were also significantly improved (psychiatrist's rating p less than 0.001; nurses' rating p less than 0.005; Beck inventory p less than 0.005). These findings confirm the value of electric convulsion therapy in severe depressive illness and strongly suggest that the convulsion is important for the therapeutic effect.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
273,15897725,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The effectiveness of anxiety treatment on alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid phobic disorder: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence has emerged which indicates that the post-treatment relapse rate for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder is higher than for alcohol-dependent patients without a comorbid anxiety disorder. The question raised by this evidence is whether the relapse rate in these dually diagnosed patients could be reduced if they were given additional treatment for the comorbid anxiety disorder. We attempted to answer this question by conducting a trial among patients with a double diagnosis of alcohol dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia. METHOD: We conducted a 32-week randomized controlled trial among 96 abstinent patients with a primary diagnosis of alcohol dependence and a comorbid anxiety disorder involving agoraphobia or social phobia. The patients were randomly assigned to an intensive psychosocial relapse-prevention program on its own (n = 49) or in combination with an anxiety treatment program comprising cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and optional pharmacotherapy consisting of an SSRI (n = 47). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients who suffered an alcohol relapse during a 32-week period. The secondary outcome measures were total abstinence, a reduction in the days of heavy drinking, and less severe anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Although the additional therapy clearly reduced the anxiety symptoms, it had no significant effect on the alcohol relapse rates. CONCLUSION: Anxiety treatment for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder can alleviate anxiety symptoms, but it has no significant effect on the outcome of alcohol treatment programs.",,Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The widespread access to TAT makes it a potentially cost-effective and inventive option available for delivery in multiple settings. This study assessed acceptability of the web-based Therapeutic Education System (TES) in hospitalized dual diagnosis patients with SUDs and other psychiatric disorders. Methods: Eligible participants were nonpsychotic, voluntary patients with self-reported drug or alcohol use in the 30 days prior to admission. They were randomly assigned to treatment as usual (TAU, n = 47) or TAU + TES (n = 48). Acceptability of this Internet-based intervention was assessed by observed utilization and self-report. Results: The TAU + TES group (# analyzed = 41) completed a mean total of 5.5 (SEM = 0.8) modules with about one module per day while hospitalized and rated TES highly on several constructs of acceptability, including novelty, usefulness and ease of understanding. Conclusions: These findings support further exploration of TAT for treatment expansion in a high acuity, dual diagnosis population and indicate the value of future research on efficacy.

276,14689176,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Community attitudes toward and knowledge of mental illness in South Africa.,"Although recent advances in psychiatry have increased our understanding of psychiatric disorders,many people with chronic or severe psychiatric disorders may be unaware that effective treatment is available. It is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help, and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the help-seeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill. Nevertheless, there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the South African community.	The aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general South African public toward mental illness, specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options.	The study design employed a questionnaire survey. Structured interviews (n = 667) were conducted with members of the general public. One of eight vignettes, portraying depression, schizophrenia, panic disorder or substance abuse, with subtle or obvious symptoms, was presented to each respondent.	The main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stress-related or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders. Treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help. Psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option, particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle, and in cases of substance abuse.	These data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist, influencing preferred treatment modality and help-seeking behaviour. More work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments. A better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions.",,Remaining,0,0

The aim of the study was to investigate the time of sobriety required to normalize immune function. Delayed hypersensitivity was investigated during disulfiram controlled abstinence in ten heavy alcoholics and in seven moderate drinkers without liver diseases. For comparison a control group of eight previous drinkers was tested. The skin test responses were modest initially with a median area of response of 12 mm2 (range 0-31) in the heavy alcoholics and 3 mm2 (0-15) in the moderate drinkers. It improved significantly in both groups after two weeks of sobriety. The responses stabilized after 8 weeks at 74 mm2 (54-102) in the heavy alcoholics and after 9 weeks at 63 mm2 (42-76) in the moderate drinking group. The control group had skin test responses of 70 mm2 (46-87), not different from the responses of the alcohol groups after two months of abstinence. The results suggest that while 2 weeks of abstinence from alcohol will improve the depressed cellular immunity, 2 months of sobriety is necessary to normalize it.",,Remaining,0,0

Clinical endocrinology & metabolism,The MCT8 thyroid hormone transporter and Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome.,"Thyroid hormone is essential for the proper development and function of the brain. The active form of thyroid hormone is T(3), which binds to nuclear receptors. Recently, a transporter specific for T(3), MCT8 (monocarboxylate transporter 8) was identified. MCT8 is highly expressed in liver and brain. The gene is located in Xq13 and mutations in MCT8 are responsible for an X-linked condition, Allan-Herndon-Dudley syndrome (AHDS). This syndrome is characterized by congenital hypotonia that progresses to spasticity with severe psychomotor delays. Affected males also present with muscle hypoplasia, generalized muscle weakness, and limited speech. Importantly, these patients have elevated serum levels of free T(3), low to below normal serum levels of free T(4), and levels of thyroid stimulating hormone that are within the normal range. This constellation of measurements of thyroid function enables quick screening for AHDS in males presenting with cognitive impairment, congenital hypotonia, and generalized muscle weakness.",,Remaining,0,0

281,1838124,Journal of inherited metabolic disease,Allele-specific amplification of genomic DNA for detection of deletion mutations: identification of a French-Canadian Tay-Sachs mutation.,"A rapid and efficient method for the detection of a 7.6-kb deletion in the beta-hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit gene, a mutant allele causing Tay-Sachs disease in French Canadians, is described. The protocol involves PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification of target sequences on normal and mutant chromosomes. Three amplification primers, a single 5' primer complementary to normal and mutant DNA templates and two 3' primers specific for normal and mutant DNA templates are required. The primers direct amplification of two unique fragments (normal and mutant) that are easily separated by gel electrophoresis. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization using normal and mutant probes to genomic DNA samples from normal, heterozygous and homozygous individuals confirms these results and is consistent with results of genotypic classification of individuals using Southern analysis. The method is applicable to detection of deletion mutations in cases where some deletion-flanking sequence is known.",,Remaining,0,0
282,27477332,Journal of clinical nursing,The experiences of families living with the anticipatory loss of a school-age child with spinal muscular atrophy - the parents' perspectives.,"To probe into parents' anticipatory loss of school-age children with Type I or II spinal muscular atrophy.	Spinal muscular atrophy is a rare disorder that causes death. Children die early due to either gradual atrophy or an infection of the lungs. Therefore, family members experience anticipatory loss, which causes grief before the actual loss. Family members feel physically and mentally exhausted, which results in a family crisis. Therefore, it is important to explore their experiences related to anticipatory loss to assist with the adjustment of the families to their circumstances.	This study applied a phenomenology method and purposive sampling.	The 19 parents who participated in this study were referred to us by two medical centers in Taiwan. Their average age was 32-49 years.	Using in-depth interviews, this study explored parents' anticipatory loss. The interviews were recorded and transcribed. Meanings were extracted using Giorgi analysis, and precision was assessed according to Guba and Lincoln, which was treated as the evaluation standard.	Four themes were identified from the parents' interviews. The themes included enduring the helplessness and pressure of care, suffering due to the child's rare and unknown condition, loss of hope and a reinforcement of the parent-child attachment, and avoiding the pressure of death and enriching the child's life.	The research findings help nurses identify anticipatory loss among parents of school-age children with type I or II spinal muscular atrophy. They enhance health professionals' understanding of the panic that occurs in the society surrounding the families, family members' dynamic relationships, and the families' demands for care.	In an attempt to providing intersubjective empathy and support with family having a child with type I and II SMA, nurses may recognize relevant family reactions and enhancing their hope and parent-child attachment. Encourage family members and child go beyond the pressure of death and create customized care plans meeting families' emotional and medical needs.",anticipatory loss| school-age children| spinal muscular atrophy,Remaining,0,0
283,23520058,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,High-resolution tracking of motor disorders in Parkinson's disease during unconstrained activity.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) can present with a variety of motor disorders that fluctuate throughout the day, making assessment a challenging task. Paper-based measurement tools can be burdensome to the patient and clinician and lack the temporal resolution needed to accurately and objectively track changes in motor symptom severity throughout the day. Wearable sensor-based systems that continuously monitor PD motor disorders may help to solve this problem, although critical shortcomings persist in identifying multiple disorders at high temporal resolution during unconstrained activity. The purpose of this study was to advance the current state of the art by (1) introducing hybrid sensor technology to concurrently acquire surface electromyographic (sEMG) and accelerometer data during unconstrained activity and (2) analyzing the data using dynamic neural network algorithms to capture the evolving temporal characteristics of the sensor data and improve motor disorder recognition of tremor and dyskinesia. Algorithms were trained (n=11 patients) and tested (n=8 patients; n=4 controls) to recognize tremor and dyskinesia at 1-second resolution based on sensor data features and expert annotation of video recording during 4-hour monitoring periods of unconstrained daily activity. The algorithms were able to make accurate distinctions between tremor, dyskinesia, and normal movement despite the presence of diverse voluntary activity. Motor disorder severity classifications averaged 94.9% sensitivity and 97.1% specificity based on 1 sensor per symptomatic limb. These initial findings indicate that new sensor technology and software algorithms can be effective in enhancing wearable sensor-based system performance for monitoring PD motor disorders during unconstrained activities.",EMG| Parkinson's disease quantification| accelerometer| dyskinesia| motor disorder| tremor,Remaining,0,0

The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) was divided into proximal (brainstem, preganglionic, gasserian ganglion, and cavernous sinus) and distal (extracranial V1, V2, and V3) segments. Lesions were organized according to segments and correlated with the type and distribution of clinical symptoms or signs. The purpose of the study was to (1) determine the efficacy of clinical localization of cranial nerve V lesions, (2) compare CT and MR for cranial nerve V imaging, (3) develop an MR protocol for effective cranial nerve V imaging, and (4) construct a differential diagnosis by anatomic segment for lesions of cranial nerve V. Clinical localization was found to be extremely inaccurate. CT was not as sensitive as MR for lesions involving the basal cisterns and skull base and will not detect the most common brainstem lesions (small infarcts and multiple sclerosis plaques). The MR protocol developed does not rely heavily on clinical localization. On the basis of lesions found in this series, a differential diagnosis by segment was developed. Patients with cranial nerve V symptoms should undergo MR imaging according to the protocol provided in this article. CT is not as effective as MR in imaging some cranial nerve V segments.

The total sleep time was shorter and nighttime awakenings were more frequent in the preterm mothers at 2 weeks after childbirth, but without a significant difference. We analyzed the changes in the sleep data of the mothers of preterm infants longitudinally, including sleep behaviors and the EPDS and PSQI scores. The total sleep time at 1 month postpartum was shorter than that at other periods, and significantly shorter than that at 2 weeks and 6 months postpartum.

291,9745353,Seishin shinkeigaku zasshi = Psychiatria et neurologia Japonica,[A study of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in the presenium and senium].,"Recently, with the increase in elderly population, we have had more opportunities to administer neuroleptics to elderly patients for hallucinatory delusional state, delirium, psychomotor excitement, wandering etc. However, little is known about the characteristics of the neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) in elderly patients, which is the most serious side effect of neuroleptics. In this paper, we present the clinical course of five NMS patients in the presenium and senium. Case 1 was 72-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). He showed nocturnal wandering, insomnia, and irritability. Tiapride 60 mg per day had been administered previously. Just after the addition of oxypertine 10 mg per day, NMS occurred, and he died of pneumonia a week later. Case 2 was 75-year-old male who was diagnosed as having vascular dementia. He showed insomnia, hyperactivity and wandering. He had been given levomepromazine (LPZ) 10 mg per day over a long period of time. At first, he had daily episodic fever, however, serum CPK levels did not increase at that time. A month later, all the symptoms of NMS appeared and then the patient's condition suddenly deteriorated and he died three days later. Case 3 was a 64-year-old male who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with early onset). He showed insomnia, irritability and violence. Tiapride 50-125 mg per day was administered along with oxypertine 50-115 mg per day. Almost two months later, NMS occurred. He had daily episodic fever at first, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities gradually increased. Soon after symptoms of NMS were completed. In this case, NMS seemed to be induced by bacterial pneumonia after long term administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. Case 4 was a 75-year-old female who was diagnosed as having dementia of Alzheimer's type (with late onset). She showed hallucinatory delusional state. Although she had autonomic instabilities just after adminstration of haloperidol 1-2 mg per day, NMS itself occurred after discontinuing the neuroleptic. Case 5 was a 61-year-old female who was diagnosed as having schizophrenia at the age of forty. She was given various neuroleptics over a period of time. The neuroimaging in SPECT showed her cerebral cortex was generally hypoactive. She had a tendency to have autonomic instabilities after the administration of relatively high potential neuroleptics. Risperidone 3-6 mg per day was administered, and almost a month later, autonomic instabilities increased and she was diagnosed as having NMS. All the patients would be able to have brain dysfunction, which suggested that such patients may be liable to NMS. In our patients, NMS occurred after the additional administration of oxypertine 10 mg per day or after long time administration of LPZ 5 mg per day. It was suggested that NMS could occur after the administration of low dose and relatively low potential neuroleptics in elderly patients. Our 3 of 5 patients showed the delayed type of NMS, which might be relatively more frequent in senior and presenior patients than in younger patients. In case 3, NMS was induced by the somatic disease (bacterial pneumonia), however in other cases, NMS was not always induced by somatic disease. Our 4 of 5 patients experienced some of the symptoms of NMS--episodic fever, extrapyramidal symptoms and autonomic instabilities--before the onset of NMS. Such symptoms may be 'pre-steps' to NMS. Once NMS occurred, the patient's systemic condition tended to deteriorate acutely. Due to the fact that our 2 of 5 patients died, it was suggested that the prognosis of the NMS patients in presenium and senium tends to be much worse. It is important to find the 'pre-steps' to NMS and treat them as soon as possible for better prognosis.",,Remaining,0,0
292,34131185,Scientific reports,Association of age-related cognitive and obstacle avoidance performances.,"An association between cognitive impairment and tripping over obstacles during locomotion in older adults has been suggested. However, owing to its memory-guided movement, whether this is more pronounced in the trailing limb is poorly known. We examined age-related changes in stepping over, focusing on trailing limb movements, and their association with cognitive performance. Age-related changes in obstacle avoidance were examined by comparing the foot kinematics of 105 older and 103 younger adults when stepping over an obstacle. The difference in the clearance between the leading and trailing limbs (Δ clearance) was calculated to determine the degree of decrement in the clearance of the trailing limb. A cognitive test battery was used to evaluate cognitive function among older adults to assess their association with Δ clearance. Older adults showed a significantly lower clearance of the trailing limb than young adults, resulting in greater Δ clearance. Significant correlations were observed between greater Δ clearance and scores on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and immediate recall of the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised Logical Memory test. Therefore, memory functions may contribute to the control of trailing limb movements, which can secure a safety margin to avoid stumbling over an obstacle during obstacle avoidance locomotion.",,Remaining,0,0
293,25031221,Schizophrenia bulletin,Mediodorsal and visual thalamic connectivity differ in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder with and without psychosis history.,"Empirical and theoretical studies implicate thalamocortical circuits in schizophrenia, supported by emerging resting-state functional connectivity studies (rs-fcMRI). Similar but attenuated alterations were found in bipolar disorder (BD). However, it remains unknown if segregated loops within thalamocortical systems show distinct rs-fcMRI alterations in schizophrenia. For instance, the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus, known to project to prefrontal networks, may be differently altered than the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), known to project to the occipital cortex. Also, it remains unknown if these circuits show different patterns of alterations in BD as a function of psychosis history, which may be associated with a more severe clinical course. We addressed these questions in 90 patients with chronic schizophrenia and 73 remitted BD patients (33 with psychosis history) matched to 146 healthy comparison subjects. We hypothesized that the MD vs LGN would show dissociations across diagnostic groups. We found that MD and LGN show more qualitative similarities than differences in their patterns of dysconnectivity in schizophrenia. In BD, patterns qualitatively diverged between thalamic nuclei although these effects were modest statistically. BD with psychosis history was associated with more severe dysconnectivity, particularly for the MD nucleus. Also, the MD nucleus showed connectivity reductions with the cerebellum in schizophrenia but not in BD. Results suggest dissociations for thalamic nuclei across diagnoses, albeit carefully controlling for medication is warranted in future studies. Collectively, these findings have implications for designing more precise neuroimaging-driven biomarkers that can identify common and divergent large-scale network perturbations across psychiatric diagnoses with shared symptoms.",bipolar illness| connectivity| cross-diagnostic comparisons| mediodorsal nucleus| resting-state| schizophrenia| thalamus,Remaining,0,0
294,12707046,The American journal of pathology,Microtubule reduction in Alzheimer's disease and aging is independent of tau filament formation.,"Biochemical studies show that phosphorylated tau, like that found in paired helical filaments (PHFs), does not promote microtubule assembly leading to the view that PHF formation leads to microtubule deficiency in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of AD, no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in AD and its relationship with PHFs has been performed. To examine this issue directly, we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from AD and control cases. Ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of PHF accumulation. We found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from AD in comparison to control cases (P = 0.000004) but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to PHFs (P = 0.8). Further, we found a significant age-dependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases (P = 0.016). These findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of AD and aging.",,Remaining,0,0

All patients presented with a similar retinal appearance of dense stalk tissue, globular dystrophic retina, and peripheral avascular retina with pigmentary changes. Each patient was found to have a mutation in the Norrie gene affecting a cystine residue in the cystine knot domain. The mutations are predicted to disrupt the structure of the protein product, norrin, which is required for activation of the Wnt receptor:beta-catenin pathway.	No other vitreoretinopathy that the authors have seen demonstrates this characteristic retinal presentation of severe retinal dysplasia.

296,22909445,Journal of psychiatry & neuroscience : JPN,Morphometric differences in central stress-regulating structures between women with and without borderline personality disorder.,"Experiences of early life stress, increased psychological arousal and the body's physiologic stress response seem to play an important role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of borderline personality disorder (BPD). In the present study, we investigated alterations in grey matter of central stress-regulating structures in female patients with BPD.	We examined T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging scans of unmedicated, right-handed female patients with BPD (according to DSM-IV criteria) and healthy controls matched for age, intelligence and education using fully automated DARTEL voxel-based morphometry. Our regions of interest analyses included the hippocampus, amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and hypothalamus.	We enrolled 30 patients and 33 controls in our study. The grey matter of patients with BPD was reduced in the hippocampus, but increased in the hypothalamus compared with healthy participants. Hypothalamic volume correlated positively with the history of traumatization in patients with BPD. No significant alterations were found in the amygdala and ACC.	This study is limited by the lack of measures of corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol levels. Furthermore, moderate sample size and comorbid disorders need to be considered.	Our findings provide new evidence for grey matter alterations in the hypothalamus and replicate previously reported decrements in hippocampal volume in patients with BPD. Understanding the role of the hypothalamus and other central stress-regulating structures could help us to further understand the neurobiological underpinnings of this complex disorder.",,Remaining,0,0

Youngsters were assessed at age 3 years (n = 60) and 3.5 years later (n = 44). Data were collected from children, parents, teachers, and clinicians. Results revealed that most diagnoses of SAD were not stable during this developmental period, as many children drifted toward subclinical or nonclinical status. In addition, children with clinical SAD, compared to those with subclinical SAD or no symptoms of SAD, had a disproportionately higher number of comorbid diagnoses and experienced significantly greater somatic concerns, anxiety, and general internalizing behavior. In addition, their parents experienced greater depression, obsessive-compulsive behavior, phobic anxiety, and general distress. The results preliminarily support prior findings that most children experience a dissipation of SAD symptoms in young childhood but that some children continue to experience stable, significant distress. The results are consistent with prior research on older children that SAD remits for many but not all youth and suggest that parent and family variables may have much to do with cases of poor remission in this population.",,Remaining,0,0

Up till now there is no specific documentation tool for the outpatient care of depressive disorders. Within the project 'Comprehensive Quality Management in Out-patient Care' a documentation tool for primary care as well as for psychiatric care of depressive patients has been developed, which embraces the principal diagnostic and therapeutic measures. This documentation tool consisting of an instrument for the physician to record the first consultation, a second instrument to record the following consultations as well as a patient questionnaire has been implemented and evaluated in primary care and psychiatric practices. The evaluation results demonstrate that the documentation tool is able to assess guideline-oriented treatment measures.

301,36085340,Pituitary,Historical and future trends in emergency pituitary referrals: a machine learning analysis.,"Acute pituitary referrals to neurosurgical services frequently necessitate emergency care. Yet, a detailed characterisation of pituitary emergency referral patterns, including how they may change prospectively is lacking. This study aims to evaluate historical and current pituitary referral patterns and utilise state-of-the-art machine learning tools to predict future service use.	A data-driven analysis was performed using all available electronic neurosurgical referrals (2014-2021) to the busiest U.K. pituitary centre. Pituitary referrals were characterised and volumes were predicted using an auto-regressive moving average model with a preceding seasonal and trend decomposition using Loess step (STL-ARIMA), compared against a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm, Prophet and two standard baseline forecasting models. Median absolute, and median percentage error scoring metrics with cross-validation were employed to evaluate algorithm performance.	462 of 36,224 emergency referrals were included (referring centres = 48; mean patient age = 56.7 years, female:male = 0.49:0.51). Emergency medicine and endocrinology accounted for the majority of referrals (67%). The most common presentations were headache (47%) and visual field deficits (32%). Lesions mainly comprised tumours or haemorrhage (85%) and involved the pituitary gland or fossa (70%). The STL-ARIMA pipeline outperformed CNN-LSTM, Prophet and baseline algorithms across scoring metrics, with standard accuracy being achieved for yearly predictions. Referral volumes significantly increased from the start of data collection with future projected increases (p < 0.001) and did not significantly reduce during the COVID-19 pandemic.	This work is the first to employ large-scale data and machine learning to describe and predict acute pituitary referral volumes, estimate future service demands, explore the impact of system stressors (e.g. COVID pandemic), and highlight areas for service improvement.",COVID-19| Machine learning| Referrals| Service demand| Time-series forecasting,Remaining,0,0

Furthermore, a specific category of women, deemed to be women-at-risk, face particular challenges in their journey and resettlement process. This longitudinal study investigated psychological distress in refugee women-at-risk one year after resettlement in Australia. Follow-up survey of 83 women-at-risk (mean age = 33.41 years; SD = 11.93) assessed: trauma events and symptoms; loss events and loss distress; level of post-migration problems; anxiety, depression, and somatic symptoms; and absence of trust in community members. Participants demonstrated no symptom change since initial assessment (p > .05). Substantial proportions of women reported traumatization (39%), PTSD (20%), anxiety (32%), and depression (39%) above clinical cut-offs, and high levels of somatization and loss distress. Post-migration problems, trauma events, and region of birth were associated with all symptoms, with post-migration problems the strongest predictor. Absence of trust in community members was associated with trauma, depression, and somatic symptoms. Initial trauma and somatic symptoms were associated with follow-up traumatic and somatic symptoms. Loss and trauma events were associated with loss distress. Findings underline the role of post-migration problems on psychological distress and the need to consider women's psychological wellbeing in the context of their trauma and loss history, potential impacts of ethnicity, and complex socio-cultural dynamics underpinning issues of trust within communities. Effective service delivery requires that practitioners screen for and address psychological distress in women-at-risk at least up to 18 months after resettlement.",longitudinal| loss| psychological symptoms| refugees| trust| women-at-risk,Remaining,0,0

306,10652033,Kidney international,Genetic polymorphism of the renin-angiotensin system and organ damage in essential hypertension.,"The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) plays a significant role in the development of hypertensive cardiac and vascular remodeling. Recently, several genetic variants of its key components, which may be clinically relevant and thus prove to be useful in the evaluation of cardiovascular risk, have been described. We therefore investigated the association between ACE I/D, AGT M235T, and AT1 A1266C gene polymorphisms and early signs of target organ damage in 215 untreated patients with essential hypertension (EH).	Genotyping was based on the polymerase chain reaction technique, with further restriction analysis when required. Albuminuria was measured as the albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR). The left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was assessed by echocardiography (LVH = LVMI > or = 125 g/m2), carotid wall thickness (IMT) by an ultrasonographic (US) scan, and retinal vascular changes by direct ophthalmoscopy (Keith-Wagener classification).	The prevalence of microalbuminuria (Mi), LVH, and retinal vascular changes was 14, 46, and 74%, respectively. ACE, AGT, and AT1 genotype distribution was in agreement with the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no difference in age, duration of disease, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure, and lipid profile when data were analyzed on the basis of genotype. Serum levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) were related to the ACE genotype (10.2 +/- 0.5, DD; 8.2 +/- 0.3, ID; 6.5 +/- 0.4 IU/mL, II; P < 0. 0001 by analysis of variance). The ACE genotype independently influences serum ACE levels and accounts for approximately 14% of its variations (F = 26.7, r2 = 0.1393, df 1 to 214, P < 0.0001). Patients with DD and ID genotypes showed higher levels of ACR (1.59 +/- 0.2, DD + ID; 0.8 +/- 0.2 mg/mmol, II; P < 0.006 by ANOVA) and bigger LVMI (124.1 +/- 2.3, DD + ID vs. 117.8 +/- 3.6 g/m2, II; P < 0.01 by ANOVA). No differences in the prevalence and degree of target organ damage (TOD) were found when data were analyzed on the basis of the AGT and AT1 genotypes, respectively. Potentially unfavorable combinations of genotypes were also investigated by K-means cluster analysis. Two subgroups of patients were identified (cluster 1, N = 70; cluster 2, N = 57), and each differed significantly with regards to the presence and degree of TOD and patterns of RAAS gene polymorphisms (F, 15.97 for ACR; F, 7.19 for IMT; F, 217.03 for LVMI; F, 3.91 for ACE; F, 4.06 for AGT; and F, 5. 22 for AT1; df 1 to 214, P < 0.02, for each one of the variables examined).	The D allele of the ACE gene may be an independent risk factor for the development of target organ damage, and evaluating it could be useful for assessing cardiovascular risk in EH. Unfavorable patterns of RAAS genotypes seem to predispose patients to subclinical cardiovascular disease in EH.",,Remaining,0,0

Secondly, to investigate whether the HRQoL of spouses was correlated with the assessment of their partner's depression, their own depression and the self-perceived level of care burden experienced by the caregiver partner.	Assessment of patients was based on the clinical diagnosis of a major depressive disorder as established by the criteria of the DSM-IV-TR, the geriatric depression scale GDS-15 and the LEIPAD questionnaire specific to subjects aged 65 or over living at home. Spouses were assessed by GDS-15, the Zarit scale for assessing caregiver burden and the LEIPAD questionnaire. The HRQoL of controls, who were matched for age, sex and educational level, was assessed by LEIPAD.	The study sample (n=38) was made up of 19 patients (mean age of 76.6 years, standard deviation 8.1) and their spouses (mean age of 75.3 years, standard deviation 8.2). The HRQoL score of the spouses was significantly poorer for the scale 'Sexual functioning' (P=0.0007) than that of controls and was negatively affected by their partner's depression (P=0.02). The HRQoL scores of the spouses for 'Physical function', 'Depression and anxiety' and 'Sexual functioning' were negatively affected by their own depression (correlation coefficients r=0.50, 0.53 and 0.54, respectively). The HRQoL scores for 'Self-care', 'Sexual functioning' and 'Life satisfaction' were also negatively affected in spouses by the self-perceived burden of care (correlation coefficients r=0.59, 0.57 and 0.51, respectively).	The sexual quality of life of spouses of elderly patients suffering from a major depressive disorder was significantly impaired. The patients' and spouses' depression and the caregivers' burden also had a negative impact on several aspects of the HRQoL of the spouses.

However, the past decade of gene discovery in ASD has been most notable for the application, in large family-based cohorts, of high-density microarray studies of submicroscopic chromosomal structure as well as high-throughput DNA sequencing-leading to the identification of an increasingly long list of risk regions and genes disrupted by rare, de novo germline mutations of large effect. This genomic architecture offers particular advantages for the illumination of biological mechanisms but also presents distinctive challenges.

Three scales, derived from orthogonal factor analyses, were developed and cross-validated: (1) Autonomic Response Frequency, assessing spontaneous fluctuations in autonomic responding; (2) Autonomic Response to Stress, assessing the amount of autonomic arousal perceived by a subject in stress situations; and (3) Somatic Response Control, a self-report measure of capacity to control both autonomic and fine muscle responses.

A representative sample of clubhouses more than three years old that were based on the Fountain House model participated in a 1998 mail survey. To verify that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality for use in setting benchmark performance rates, 71 certified and 48 noncertified programs were compared on a variety of organizational variables.	Even though certified and noncertified clubhouses were similar in organizational structure and resources, findings from a logistic regression analysis confirmed that certified clubhouses provided a wider array of rehabilitation services and achieved higher rates of employment.	The findings suggest that ICCD certification is a valid indicator of program quality. The ICCD has therefore proposed that the average performance of certified U.S. clubhouses in specific domains be adopted as benchmarks for organizational performance. When tailored for programs in particular regions and with specific levels of funding, the ICCD benchmarks for clubhouse performance set fair and reasonable expectations for clubhouse programs and for the design of performance contracts between departments of mental health and ICCD clubhouses.",,Remaining,0,0
321,37660045,Translational psychiatry,Brain mediators of biased social learning of self-perception in social anxiety disorder.,"Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is characterized by an excessive fear of social evaluation and a persistently negative view of the self. Here we test the hypothesis that negative biases in brain responses and in social learning of self-related information contribute to the negative self-image and low self-esteem characteristic of SAD. Adult participants diagnosed with social anxiety (N = 21) and matched controls (N = 23) rated their performance and received social feedback following a stressful public speaking task. We investigated how positive versus negative social feedback altered self-evaluation and state self-esteem and used functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to characterize brain responses to positive versus negative feedback. Compared to controls, participants with SAD updated their self-evaluation and state self-esteem significantly more based on negative compared to positive social feedback. Responses in the frontoparietal network correlated with and mirrored these behavioral effects, with greater responses to positive than negative feedback in non-anxious controls but not in participants with SAD. Responses to social feedback in the anterior insula and other areas mediated the effects of negative versus positive feedback on changes in self-evaluation. In non-anxious participants, frontoparietal brain areas may contribute to a positive social learning bias. In SAD, frontoparietal areas are less recruited overall and less attuned to positive feedback, possibly reflecting differences in attention allocation and cognitive regulation. More negatively biased brain responses and social learning could contribute to maintaining a negative self-image in SAD and other internalizing disorders, thereby offering important new targets for interventions.",,Remaining,0,0

Pathological changes occur mostly in the pallidium and stratium.	We report seven patients with a new form of chronic manganese toxicity due to long-term intravenous use of a solution consisting of ephedrine, acetylsalicylic acid and potassium permanganate as a psycho-stimulant, popularly known as 'Russian Cocktail'.	The age of the patients ranged between 19 and 31 years, and the duration of substance abuse was between nine and 106 months. The onset of symptoms from first use ranged seven to 35 months. The initial symptom was impaired speech followed by gait disturbance and bradykinesia. In addition to these symptoms, choreic movements, ataxia presenting as backward falls and dystonia were also seen. Serum and urine samples revealed high levels of manganese. Hyperintense lesions on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging were seen in bilateral basal ganglia and brainstem, dentate nuclei, features consistent with manganese intoxication.	Manganese toxicity, which may cause a distinctive irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, can be seen frequently with 'Russian Cocktail' abuse, a substance which can be accessed very easily and at a low cost.",,Remaining,0,0

From March 2006 to July 2008, MRI was performed on 135 pregnant women whose fetuses diagnosed as fetal ventriculomegaly at an average of 32 gestational weeks in Shengjing Hospital Affiliated to China Medical University. Mild ventriculomegaly was defined when the width of unilateral or bilateral fetal cerebral ventricle triangle was 10-15 mm, moderate ventriculomegaly 16-20 mm and severe ventriculomegaly >20 mm. We introduced the Denver developmental screening test (DDST) to follow-up the mild ventriculomegaly and normal babies, confirmed by MRI, at 6-12 months after birth and a case-control study was conducted. The intelligence and growth of these infants were analyzed.	(1) Diagnostic rate of fetal ventriculomegaly through MRI: Among the 135 gravidas, 60 (44.4%) showed isolated ventriculomegaly, 5(3.7%) complicated with ventricular hemorrhage; 12 (8.9%) complicated with agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC) and 2 (1.5%) complicated with cerebellar hypoplasia, while 56 (41.5%) were normal. Seventy-nine cases had fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI and 15.2% (n = 12) of them complicated with ACC. (2) Degree of fetal ventriculomegaly on MRI: Among the 60 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 55 (91.7%) were mild and 5 (8.3%) moderate ones. Among the 5 cases complicated with ventricular hemorrhage, one was mild ventriculomegaly, and 4 moderate or severe cases. Among the 12 cases with ACC, 8 (66.7%) were moderate ventriculomegaly and 4 (33.3%) severe cases. The 2 cases with cerebellar hypoplasia were both moderate ventriculomegaly fetuses. (3) Follow-up at 6-12 months after birth: thirty out (case group) of the 55 isolated ventriculomegaly cases, 38 out of the 56 normal babies and 42 babies with normal MRI results were followed up, and the later 80 cases were taken as control. Four infants (13.3%) in the case group and 10 (12.5%) in the control group showed abnormal or suspected results in DDST (P > 0.05), the rest babies were all normal. (4) Clinical outcomes of the 79 ventriculomegaly fetuses diagnosed by MRI: thirty mild ventriculomegaly babies and 5 moderate ones were born at term and showed normal at follow ups. However, 7 gravidas were not compliant, 6 pregnancies were terminated, and 12 were lost. Three of the 12 cases with ACC continued the pregnancy, and postnatal MRI of the babies showed the same with the prenatal MRI, 8 pregnancies were induced and one was lost. All of the 5 fetuses with ventricular hemorrhage were induced and the prenatal diagnosis was confirmed by autopsy. One of the 2 fetuses with cerebellar hypoplasia was term delivered and diagnosed as cerebral palsy at the age of 6 months, and the other one was induced.	MRI is an indispensable complementary diagnostic method for fetal ventriculomegaly diagnosed through ultrasound.

The authors analyze the clinical and financial outcomes of OUD in a contemporary cohort of AMI hospitalizations.	All non-elective adult (≥ 18 years) hospitalizations for AMI were tabulated from the 2016‒2019 Nationwide Readmissions Database using relevant International Classification of Disease codes. Patients were grouped into OUD and non-OUD cohorts. Bivariate and regression analyses were performed to identify the independent association of OUD with outcomes after non-elective admission for AMI, as well as subsequent readmission.	Of an estimated 3,318,257 hospitalizations for AMI meeting study criteria, 36,057 (1.1%) had a concomitant diagnosis of OUD. While OUD was not significantly associated with mortality, OUD patients experienced superior cardiovascular outcomes compared to non-OUD. However, OUD was linked to increased odds of non-cardiovascular complications, length of stay, costs, non-home discharge, and 30-day non-elective readmission.	Patients with OUD presented with AMI at a significantly younger age than non-OUD. While OUD appears to have a cardioprotective effect, it is associated with several markers of increased resource use, including readmission. The present findings underscore the need for a multifaceted approach to increasing social services and treatment for OUD at index hospitalization.",Acute myocardial infarction| Cardiovascular| Coronary artery bypass graft| Opioid use disorder| Percutaneous coronary intervention| Readmissions,Remaining,0,0

The current study is the first to examine changes in meal-related anxiety as a predictor of outcomes in the context of a family-based partial hospitalization program. A sample of 51 adolescents with anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia rated anxiety before and after all treatment meals using the Subjective Units of Distress Scale (SUDS). Regression analyses suggested that participants experiencing a greater reduction in meal anxiety endorsed fewer eating disordered symptoms on the EDE at the end of treatment. Reductions in meal anxiety did not predict EBW at end of treatment, which could be because family-based treatment (FBT) supports adequate food intake regardless of meal anxiety (i.e., parents ensure food intake). Findings suggest that reductions in meal-related anxiety may be an important predictor of outcomes in family-based interventions, and future research is needed to examine if directly targeting meal anxiety may enhance outcomes.",,Remaining,0,0

This article reports the results of speech and language assessments for a group of 28 children aged 12 to 24 months who were newly adopted from Eastern Europe. Most of the children did well, with average English language standard scores within normal limits on the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scale-Developmental Profile. The majority of children were also rapidly learning to understand and produce English words as measured on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory. These findings were used to develop peer-based infant-toddler guidelines for early speech and language intervention.

330,26876488,Scientific reports,Brain-derived neurotrophic factor promoter methylation and cortical thickness in recurrent major depressive disorder.,"Recent studies have reported that methylation of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene promoter is associated with major depressive disorder (MDD). This study aimed to investigate the association between cortical thickness and methylation of BDNF promoters as well as serum BDNF levels in MDD. The participants consisted of 65 patients with recurrent MDD and 65 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Methylation of BDNF promoters and cortical thickness were compared between the groups. The right medial orbitofrontal, right lingual, right lateral occipital, left lateral orbitofrontal, left pars triangularis, and left lingual cortices were thinner in patients with MDD than in healthy controls. Among the MDD group, right pericalcarine, right medical orbitofrontal, right rostral middle frontal, right postcentral, right inferior temporal, right cuneus, right precuneus, left frontal pole, left superior frontal, left superior temporal, left rostral middle frontal and left lingual cortices had inverse correlations with methylation of BDNF promoters. Higher levels of BDNF promoter methylation may be closely associated with the reduced cortical thickness among patients with MDD. Serum BDNF levels were significantly lower in MDD, and showed an inverse relationship with BDNF methylation only in healthy controls. Particularly the prefrontal and occipital cortices seem to indicate key regions in which BDNF methylation has a significant effect on structure.",,Remaining,0,0

Advances in our knowledge of RRB are hindered by the inconsistencies in how RRB is measured. The present study examined the factor structure of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) in a sample of 350 children with ASD ages 2-9. Confirmatory factor analysis designed for items with categorical response types was implemented to examine six proposed structural models. The five-factor model demonstrated the most parsimonious fit based on common overall fit indices that was further supported by examination of local model fit indicators, though, the four- and six-factor models evidenced adequate-to-good fit as well. Examination of RRB factor score approaches indicated only minor differences between summed item subscale scores and extracted factor scores with regard to associations with diagnostic measures. All RRB subtypes demonstrated significant associations with cognitive functioning and adaptive behavior. Implications for future research validating the RBS-R as a more extensive clinical measure of RRB in ASD are discussed.

To better understand the role of repetitive behaviors, we must establish effective ways of measuring them. This study assessed the measurement qualities of the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) in a sample of 350 children with ASD ages 2-9. We found that the RBS-R measures multiple types of repetitive behaviors and that these behaviors are related to thinking ability and independence.",adaptive behavior| autism| children| factor analysis| restricted/repetitive behaviors,Remaining,0,0

Suggestions have been made to advance psychological understanding of negative symptoms by focusing on the social cognitive processes involved in symptom formation and maintenance.	Following the recommendations by the National Institute of Mental Health workshop on social cognition in schizophrenia, this study investigated associations between negative symptoms and various aspects of social cognition including Theory of Mind (ToM), attribution, empathy, self-esteem, and interpersonal self-concepts in 75 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders and 75 healthy controls.	Negative symptoms were significantly associated with difficulties in ToM, less readiness to be empathic, lower self-esteem, less self-serving bias, negative self-concepts related to interpersonal abilities, and dysfunctional acceptance beliefs. Different aspects of social cognition were mildly to moderately correlated and interacted in their impact on negative symptoms: Difficulties in ToM were associated with negative symptoms in persons with low but not in persons with medium or high levels of self-esteem. Taken together, the social cognition variables and their hypothesized interaction explained 39% of the variance in negative symptoms after controlling for neurocognition and depression.	The results highlight the relevance of self-concepts related to social abilities, dysfunctional beliefs, and global self-worth alone and in interaction with ToM deficits for negative symptoms and thereby provide a helpful basis for advancing psychosocial interventions.",,Remaining,0,0

S8 and Prx2) genes by characterizing the expression of the human orthologs and their potential for causing specific human malformations. The expression pattern of PRRX2 and its close relative, PRRX1, were analyzed in human tissue by RT-PCR. Although the expression of these human genes is similar to their mouse orthologs, there are notable differences in expression. PRRX2 was detected in the human kidney and lung, whereas in mice and chickens neither of these tissues has been reported to express Prrx2. For PRRX1 the expression pattern was quite similar to other vertebrates, but the ratio of the two isoforms was reversed. To begin the search for the gene-disease connection, both genes were mapped to human chromosomes by FISH. The PRRX1 locus maps to 1q23, whereas the PRRX2 locus maps to 9q34.1. This localization, along with the recently described phenotypes of the gene-targeted Prrx1, Prrx2 and double mutant mice, enabled us to search the human disease databases for similar malformations. This examination suggested that mutations at the PRRX1 and/or PRRX2 loci could result in Nager Acrofacial Dysostosis (NAFD) syndrome.

Also, there are controversial data about the comparison between euthymic bipolar patients and different subgroups of schizophrenia in neurocognition, functioning, and QoL level. The present study aimed to compare the neurocognitive performance, functional outcome, and QoL of remitted and non-remitted patients with SC with respect to a group of euthymic patients with BD, and a control group. It included 655 subjects: 98 patients with schizophrenia in remission (SC-R), 184 non-remitted patients with schizophrenia (SC-NR), 117 euthymic patients with bipolar I disorder (BD), and 256 healthy subjects. A comprehensive clinical, neurocognitive (six cognitive domains), functional, and QoL assessment was carried out. Remission criteria of Andreasen were used to classify schizophrenia patients as remitted or non-remitted. Compared with control subjects all groups of patients showed impaired neurocognitive performance, functioning and QoL. SC-R patients had an intermediate functioning between control subjects and SC-NR, all at a neurocognitive, functional, or QoL level. There were no significant differences between SC-R and BD. These results suggest that reaching clinical remission is essential to achieve a better level of psychosocial functioning, and QoL.

The present study reviewed the records of 100 male and female cocaine abusers admitted to a private substance abuse treatment program between 1987 and 1989. Patterns of cocaine use and levels of impairment were found to be similar for men and women, with male cocaine abusers more likely to abuse additional substances. Male cocaine abusers were employed more frequently than women and held higher status jobs despite equivalent levels of education. Female cocaine abusers were more likely to be diagnosed with concurrent psychiatric disorders and were more likely to report family histories of substance abuse. Both groups produced elevations on MMPI scales indicating depression, anxiety, paranoid features, and acting-out tendencies.

After being translated into Spanish, the scale was applied to a sample of 80 patients. All had a history of auditory hallucinations, 71 with Schizophrenia and 9 with schizoaffective disorder according to DSM-IV diagnostic criteria. Demographic and clinical data were collected by a semi-structured interview, tape recording the sessions for every patient. For the reliability study, 27 patients of the sample were evaluated independently by the first four auhors of this paper. For the study of concurrent validity the results of this scale were compared with those of the Krawiecka scale in 60 patients of the sample.	In the Spanish version, the 11 items were conserved with slight modifications in two of them. The scale showed high reliability with coefficients in the 11 items higher than 0.85. The concurrent validity showed high association between the hallucination item of the Krawiecka scale and the PSYRATS. In the factorial analysis four factors that explained 62% of the variance were obtained.	The Spanish version of the PSYRATS (for hallucinations) is, to our knowledge, the first scale adapted to Spanish for the study of auditory hallucinations, showing excellent psychometric properties.",,Remaining,0,0
346,8332920,Social science & medicine (1982),Knowledge for use: anthropology and community-centered substance abuse research.,"The anthropological world has changed. The ethnographic Other is no longer available and pliant, awaiting anthropological representation, but has acquired a voice of his/her own. As a result, anthropology is faced with a dilemma. What is to be the anthropological role in this transformed world? Two alternatives are examined. The first, postmodernism, stresses the development of experimental ethnographic texts that inscribe the voice of the transformed Other. Noting the weaknesses of the postmodern 'solution,' this paper proposes community-centered research as a more appropriate response to contemporary social realities. In this approach, the anthropologist seeks collaboration with the Other in the struggle for self-determination. Illustration is provided with the case study of anthropologists employed in a Puerto Rican community based organization (CBO), with specific reference to the emergence and development of the substance abuse prevention and treatment work of this CBO. While noting the difficulties of this role, the paper argues that scholarly activism, a model adopted from the Third World, is well suited to the postmodern world.",,Remaining,0,0
347,19682673,Cognition,Visual perspective taking impairment in children with autistic spectrum disorder.,"Evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking - the knowledge that different people may see the same thing differently at the same time - is a mentalising task. Thus, we would expect children with autism, who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief, to perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well. However, prior data on this issue are inconclusive. We re-examined this question, testing a group of 23 young autistic children, aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children (n=60) ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task. The results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation, relative to typical children. Furthermore, performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance. These findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism, and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task.",,Remaining,0,0
348,19544314,Depression and anxiety,Comorbid anxiety as a suicide risk factor among depressed veterans.,"Depressive disorders greatly increase suicide risk; however, little is known about the contribution of comorbid anxiety disorders or anxiety symptoms to the risk of suicide death among depressed patients. We examined whether depressed veterans with comorbid anxiety had higher risks of suicide death.	Using VA administrative databases we identified 887,859 patients with depression. We then used univariate and multivariate logistic regression, controlling for demographics and substance use disorders, to determine the odds ratios of completed suicide associated with individual comorbid anxiety disorders, the presence of any comorbid anxiety disorder, the prescription of an antianxiety medication, or the prescription of a high dose of an antianxiety medication.	In multivariate analyses, the odds of completed suicide were significantly increased for patients with panic disorder (OR 1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.53), generalized anxiety disorder (OR 1.27, 95% CI: 1.09-1.47), and anxiety disorder, not otherwise specified (OR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.12-1.38). The odds of completed suicide were also greater among patients who received any antianxiety medication (OR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.55-1.88), and were further increased among those who received high dose treatment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.98-2.57). Odds of completed suicide were decreased among patients with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.97), and there was no statistically significant relationship between social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and all other anxiety disorders and suicide.	These findings emphasize the importance of comorbid anxiety disorders and symptoms in increasing suicide risk among depressed patients and may inform suicide prevention efforts among these patients.",,Remaining,0,0

Muscle tone underpins movement. We investigated muscle tone in 34 ASD children using a standardized neuro-developmental battery, which uses the French norms for muscular tone in children.	Dangling and extensibility were used to examine passive muscle tone in the upper and lower limbs and the body axis. A comparison between muscles of the right and left sides enabled the determination of tonic laterality.	We found a disharmonious tonic typology, with a tonic component for the muscles of the trunk and the proximal muscles of the lower limbs and a laxity component for the ankles and the proximal and distal muscles of the upper limbs (wrists and shoulders). No establishment of tonic laterality was found in the upper limbs in 61% of ASD children (P<0.001).	The disturbed tonic organization influenced by subcortical structures, such as the cerebellum, may partially explain the motor disorders, and indefinite tonic laterality may also be linked to low hemispheric brain dominance described in autism. This preliminary examination is necessary before any gross motor assessments to understand the nature of movement disorders, explore typologies and highlight possible soft neuro-motor signs.",Autism spectrum disorder| Children| Enfants| Muscular tone| Neurodevelopmental standardized assessment| Tonus musculaire| Trouble du spectre de l’autisme| Évaluation neurodéveloppementale standardisée,Remaining,0,0
350,25380591,Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD,Downsizing of lean body mass is a key determinant of Alzheimer's disease.,"Lean body mass (LBM) encompasses all metabolically active organs distributed into visceral and structural tissue compartments and collecting the bulk of N and K stores of the human body. Transthyretin (TTR) is a plasma protein mainly secreted by the liver within a trimolecular TTR-RBP-retinol complex revealing from birth to old age strikingly similar evolutionary patterns with LBM in health and disease. TTR is also synthesized by the choroid plexus along distinct regulatory pathways. Chronic dietary methionine (Met) deprivation or cytokine-induced inflammatory disorders generates LBM downsizing following differentiated physiopathological processes. Met-restricted regimens downregulate the transsulfuration cascade causing upstream elevation of homocysteine (Hcy) safeguarding Met homeostasis and downstream drop of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) impairing anti-oxidative capacities. Elderly persons constitute a vulnerable population group exposed to increasing Hcy burden and declining H2S protection, notably in plant-eating communities or in the course of inflammatory illnesses. Appropriate correction of defective protein status and eradication of inflammatory processes may restore an appropriate LBM size allowing the hepatic production of the retinol circulating complex to resume, in contrast with the refractory choroidal TTR secretory process. As a result of improved health status, augmented concentrations of plasma-derived TTR and retinol may reach the cerebrospinal fluid and dismantle senile amyloid plaques, contributing to the prevention or the delay of the onset of neurodegenerative events in elderly subjects at risk of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease| homocysteine| hydrogen sulfide| lean body mass| nutritional assessment| retinoids| transthyretin,Remaining,0,0

The aim of the present study was to investigate the changes in temporal-spatial dimensional properties of EEG under different cognitive tasks in patients with schizophrenia.	EEG was recorded by using EEG-1518K system and mapping system (Nihon Kohden Tomioka Corporation, Japan) in 45 schizophrenic patients and 47 healthy adults (normal control, NC) under five states: eyes closed, eyes open, mental arithmetic test with eyes closed, memory test with eyes open, and number cancellation test. Correlation dimension (D2) and point-wise correlation dimension (PD2) were calculated for all EEG analyses.	(1) There were no significant differences of D2 and PD2 between NC and schizophrenic patients under states of eyes open and closed. (2) Compared with NC, schizophrenic patients showed decreased performance of D2 in mental arithmetic test with eyes closed and number cancellation test (mental arithmetic test with eyes closed: Nc 5.9 ± 0.6, Sch 3.0 ± 0.8; number cancellation test: Nc 6.0 ± 0.6, Sch 4.4 ± 0.7; P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

American journal of neuroradiology,Spinal cord pial metastases: MR imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine.,"The purpose of this investigation was to describe gadopentetate-dimeglumine-enhanced MR findings in metastatic disease to the pial lining of the spinal cord. Correlation was made with clinical data, other radiologic studies, and pathologic findings. Eighty-six patients with a known malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms were studied with pre- and postcontrast T1-weighted images. In seven of these patients, abnormal enhancement of the pial lining of the cord was seen on the sagittal postcontrast T1-weighted images. This appeared as a thin rim of enhancement along the surface of the cord in six patients and as a focal, thick rim of enhancement in addition to the thin rim of enhancement in the seventh patient. Axial images confirmed the location along the pial lining in each case. Precontrast T1-weighted images in all seven cases and precontrast T2-weighted images in five cases failed to detect any focal abnormalities of the pial lining of the cord. Pathologic confirmation was available in five of the seven patients. Primary malignancies in these patients included breast carcinoma (two), lymphoma (one), leukemia (one), adenocarcinoma of the lung (one), prostate carcinoma (one), and malignant melanoma (one). Three of seven patients had metastatic disease evident only within the CNS, while four patients had widespread disease outside the CNS. We conclude that contrast-enhanced MR imaging is useful in the diagnosis of pial spread of metastatic disease in patients with a known primary malignancy and unexplained neurologic signs or symptoms.",,Remaining,0,0

Overexpression of neuronal HGF has been shown to result in the attenuation of neuronal cell death and progression of disease in a familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) transgenic mouse model. HGF might be beneficial for motor neuron survival and is a good candidate agent for the treatment of ALS. So far, studies of the skin of ALS have shown unique pathological and biochemical abnormalities. However, there has been no study of HGF in ALS skin.	We made a quantitative immunohistochemical study of the expression of HGF in the skin from 19 patients with sporadic ALS and 16 controls.	Hepatocyte growth factor immunoreactivity was positive in the epidermis, some dermal blood vessels, and glands in patients with ALS. These findings became more conspicuous as ALS progressed. The optical density for HGF immunoreactivity of the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in ALS was significantly higher (P < 0.001 and P < 0.001) than in controls. There was a significant positive relation (r = 0.53, P < 0.02 and r = 0.73, P < 0.001) between HGF immunoreactivity and duration of illness in the nucleus and the cytoplasm in the epidermis in patients with ALS.

The current study aimed to describe khat dependence, use patterns, and khatrelated health problems in Australian migrant communities.	A 48-item questionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 52 participants from African migrant communities who self-reported using khat in four Australian state capital cities between April 1 and June 1, 2012. Associations between Severity of Dependence Scale for khat use (SDS-khat) screening status, use patterns, and khat-related psychological and physical health problems were assessed using multivariate loglinked Poisson regression controlling for potential sociodemographic confounders.	Overall, 44.2% (n = 23) of the study participants screened positive on the SDS-khat, indicating probable khat dependence. Screening positive for khat dependence was associated with increased risk for khat use frequency in the last 30 days (adjusted prevalence risk ratio [APRR] = 2.26, 95% CI [1.23, 4.15], p = .009), experiencing three or more psychological health problems (APRR = 1.87, 95% CI [1.04, 3.36], p = .037), and experiencing two or more physical health problems (APRR = 1.92, 95% CI [1.13, 3.27], p = .016) after using khat.	Screening positive on the SDS-khat is associated with increased recent khat use frequency and elevated physical and psychological health problems, providing preliminary evidence that probable khat use dependence may be associated with an increased risk of harm in Australia. Furthermore, these preliminary results support the potential utility of the SDS-khat to healthcare providers to identify those at risk for khatrelated harms.

However, it is unclear whether co-use of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, and/or cannabis is associated with higher levels of nicotine dependence than cigarette-only use. We investigated the relationship between cigarette/nicotine dependence and co-use of tobacco and cannabis among 4 groups of cigarette smokers aged 18-35: cigarette-only smokers, cigarette-e-cigarette (CIG-ECIG) co-users, cigarette-cannabis (CIG-CAN) co-users, and cigarette-e-cigarette-cannabis (CIG-ECIG-CAN) co-users.	Data were from a 2018 cross-sectional survey based on a national convenience sample of smokers aged 18-35 (n = 315). Cigarette/nicotine dependence was measured by the Fagerstrom Test of Nicotine Dependence (FTND) and e-cigarette dependence was measured by the Penn State E-cigarette Dependence Index. Bivariate analyses examined sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status and multivariable linear regression assessed the relationship between co-use and nicotine dependence.	In the sample, 27.6% were cigarette-only smokers, 24.8% were CIG-ECIG, 27.6% were CIG-CAN, and 20.0% were CIG-ECIG-CAN co-users. Significant differences were observed in sociodemographic and tobacco/other substance use characteristics by co-use status. E-cigarette co-users had low e-cigarette dependence, but moderate FTND scores. In adjusted analyses, only CIG-ECIG co-use was associated with higher FTND scores compared to cigarette-only smoking. However, CIG-ECIG and CIG-ECIG-CAN co-use were associated with higher FTND scores compared to CIG-CAN co-use.

All patients with isolated MCA-M1 occlusion who achieved complete reperfusion(mTICI2C-3), had a witnessed symptom onset and follow-up MRI were included. IGR was calculated as final infarct volume (FIV)(ml)/symptom onset to reperfusion time(hours) and was dichotomized according to the median value into slow-(SP) versus fast-progressors (FP). The primary analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of symptom-reperfusion time on 90-day mRS in SP and FP. Secondary analysis was performed to identify predictors of IGR.	A total of 137 patients were eligible for analysis. Mean age was 63 ± 15.4 years and median IGR was 5.13ml/hour. SP(n = 69) had higher median ASPECTS, lower median rCBF<30% lesion volume, higher proportion of favorable collaterals and hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR)<0.4, higher minimal mean arterial blood pressure before reperfusion, and lower rates of general anesthesia compared to FP(n = 68). Symptom-reperfusion time was comparable between both groups. SP had higher rates of 90-day mRS0-2(71.9%vs.38.9%,aOR;7.226,95%CI[2.431-21.482],p < 0.001) and lower median FIV.

Using a longitudinal design, we examined developmental patterns of the bidirectional links between neural mechanisms and substance use throughout adolescence.	167 adolescents (aged 13-14 years at Time 1, 53% male) were assessed annually four times. Risk-related neural processing was assessed by blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses in the insula during a lottery choice task, cognitive control by behavioral performance during the Multi-Source Interference Task, and substance use by adolescents' self-reported cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use.	Latent change score modeling indicated that greater substance use predicted increased insula activation during risk processing, but the effects of insula activation on changes in substance use were not significant. The coupling effect from substance use to insula activation was particularly strong for adolescents with low cognitive control, which supports the theorized moderating role of cognitive control.	Our results elucidate how substance use may alter brain development to be biased toward maladaptive decision-making, particularly among adolescents with poor cognitive control.

A prospective cohort study of 64 710 Swedish citizens whose fathers were conscripted for compulsory military training at ages 18-20 in 1969/70. Information on fathers' alcohol consumption, frequency of intoxication and apprehended for drunkenness, was collected during conscription. Offspring was followed for substance-related disorders from age 12 to end of follow up in 2009.	All measures of fathers' alcohol use were significantly and positively associated with risk for substance-related disorders in offspring. The associations were to a large extent explained by other risk factors in childhood. In the fully adjusted model, those with fathers in the highest alcohol consumption quintile still had a 63% higher risk (HR=1.63 CI 1.26-2.12) of substance-related disorders compared to those whose fathers' reported abstinence. The highest risk was found among offspring to fathers with alcohol-related disorders or that had been apprehended for drunkenness, with a more than two-fold increased risk for substance-related disorders.	Despite the lower risk found among offspring to fathers with sub-clinical drinking when compared to those with alcohol-related disorders, the former group accounts for a much larger proportion of all cases of substance-related disorders in the population, prompting universal prevention efforts targeting the level of total alcohol consumption in society.",Alcohol-related harm| Harm to others| Offspring negative outcome| Parental alcohol use,Remaining,0,0

Using dimensions of handicap identified and described by the WHO, CHART uses measurable, behavioral terms to compare such individuals with the norms of able-bodied members of society. Test-retest, proxies, and independent raters have established the validity and reliability of CHART. Rasch analysis has verified the CHART scaling and scoring procedures. In addition, an initial application of CHART, with a group of 342 spinal cord injured individuals, is described. Beyond demonstrating the instrument's effectiveness in assessing the extent of handicap or social disadvantage, this application, by documenting rehabilitation outcomes, demonstrates the potential usefulness of CHART for program evaluation.",,Remaining,0,0
366,25149026,Journal of psychosomatic research,Diabetes and psychiatric illness in the total population of Stockholm.,"Concomitant psychiatric disorders in people with diabetes affect morbidity and mortality. We aimed to study psychiatric morbidity in people with diabetes and the general population using administrative health care data in Stockholm County.	The study population included all living persons who resided in Stockholm County, Sweden, on January 1, 2011 (N=2,058,408). Subjects with a diagnosis of diabetes were identified with data from all consultations in primary health care, specialist outpatient care and inpatient care during the time span 2009-2013. As outcome, information was obtained on all consultations due to any psychiatric diagnosis as well as, specifically, schizophrenia, bipolar disorders, depression, and anxiety disorders, in 2011-2013. Analyses were performed by age group and gender. Age-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for women and men with diabetes, using individuals without diabetes as referents, were calculated.	Age-adjusted OR for all psychiatric diagnoses among people with diabetes was 1.296 (95% CI 1.267-1.326) for women and 1.399 (95% CI 1.368-1.432) for men. The greatest excess risk was found for schizophrenia, with OR 3.439 (95% CI 3.057-3.868) in women and 2.787 (95% CI 2.514-3.089) in men, with ORs between 1.276 (95% CI 1.227-1.327) and 1.714 (95% CI 1.540-1.905) for the remaining diagnoses.	The prevalence of psychiatric disorders is elevated in people with diabetes, which calls for preventive action to be taken to minimize suffering and costs to society.",Administrative databases| Age differences| Anxiety| Depression| Epidemiology| Gender differences| Primary care| Psychosis| Schizophrenia,Remaining,0,0

The aim of the study was to determine normal values and to assess the accuracy of CCA flow as a predictor of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis. One hundred one people who did not have disease were studied; the overall mean flow rate was 395 +/- 79 ml/min (mean +/- S.D.). There was no significant correlation with age, height, or body surface area but there was with body weight (p less than 0.05). A statistically significant difference was evident between men (424 +/- 88 ml/min) and women (371 +/- 62 ml/min) (p less than 0.001). The intrasessional variation (S.D./mean) was 13% and the intersessional variation, 16%. No significant difference was seen between the sides. Ninety-two patients who had carotid angiography were studied and the flow rates compared with the degree of ICA stenosis on each side. The flow rate for mild ICA stenosis (1% to 39%) was 404 +/- 109 ml/min, for moderate stenoses (40% to 69%), 390 +/- 91 ml/min, and for severe stenoses (70% to 99%), 351 +/- 109 ml/min. There was a significant difference in flows only between mild and severe grades of stenosis of the ICA (p less than 0.01). With unilateral stenosis, comparison of flow values in the normal and affected sides showed the greatest discriminatory power when the absolute difference of flow values was taken (p less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Remaining,0,0

The four boys presented in our study, between 10 and 17 years of age, with classical Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease, who all had a duplicated proteolipid protein gene, invariably manifested type I despite their various clinical severities. Follow-up MRI after an interval of 5 years and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy was performed in three of the patients. The white matter on the last MRI was unchanged in volume and the distribution of high-intense areas. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy revealed no abnormal peaks. These results were consistent with the lack of definite neurologic regression in the last 5 years and with the pathologic characteristics of well-preserved axons and the absence of sclerosis. Further study is required to precisely determine whether the patterns of MRI findings can be divided into subtypes corresponding to those of proteolipid protein gene abnormalities.",,Remaining,0,0

A sample of 1074 German teachers participated in this study. Two samples of the general population (N = 824 and N = 792) were used as comparison groups. Work distress was assessed with the Effort-Reward-Imbalance questionnaire, and mental health problems were measured with the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Teachers reported more effort-reward imbalance (M = 0.64) compared with the general population (M = 0.57), and they perceived more mental health problems (GHQ: M = 12.1) than the comparison group (M = 9.5). School type was not associated with work stress and mental health. Teachers with leading functions perceived high degrees of effort and reward, resulting in a moderate effort-reward ratio and no heightened mental health problems. Teachers working full time reported more effort than teachers working part time, but the reward mean values of both groups were similar. This results in a somewhat unfavourable effort-reward ratio of teachers working full time. Moreover, teachers working full time reported more mental health problems. The results support the appropriateness of the effort-reward conception, applied to the profession of teachers. The higher degree of effort-reward imbalance and the level of mental health problems warrant preventive measures.

370,18760507,Neurobiology of aging,Early diagnostic accuracy and pathophysiologic relevance of an autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer's disease peripheral biomarker.,"Treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the discovery of promising drug candidates depend on early diagnosis. Few currently available diagnostic tests have significantly improved this early uncertainty, while the 'gold standard' diagnosis continues to require clinical dementia in life and the presence of pathologic brain lesions of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brain at autopsy. Here, the inflammatory agonist bradykinin, a small nano-peptide, that induces PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 in fibroblasts, was applied to punch-biopsy-obtained human skin fibroblasts. Quantitative imaging of the phosphorylated Erk1 and Erk2 bands was then used in a ratio that is mathematically configured into an AD-Biomarker Index (AD-Index). In the population described here (N=264), there were 64 autopsy examinations. Demented individuals were clinically diagnosed as AD with an overall accuracy of 78%. Among the 42 autopsy-confirmed cases for which there were also AD-Biomarker measurements, the overall accuracy of the AD-Biomarker was 98%. Among both the autopsy-confirmed and the clinically diagnosed patients, the AD-Index values were inversely correlated with the duration of disease, i.e., the time from the onset of dementia symptoms. Among the autopsy-confirmed cases, the AD-Biomarker diagnosis showed remarkably high sensitivity (97%) and specificity (100%) compared to clinical diagnosis (sensitivity: 78% and specificity: 20%). Using autopsy validation, the clinical diagnosis was only accurate at 52% level vs. the AD-Biomarker accuracy of 100% for cases with dementia not larger than 4 years of duration. Finally, application of soluble Abeta(1-42) to the fibroblasts of normal controls induced the abnormal AD-Biomarker phenotype, suggesting the pathophysiologic relevance of this AD-Biomarker measurement. In summary, the AD-Biomarker, as confirmed by autopsy validation, showed significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than did clinical diagnosis, particularly at early stages of disease, and pathophysiological relevance was demonstrated for the mechanistic basis of the AD-Biomarker measurements.",,Remaining,0,0

372,18952610,The Journal of biological chemistry,A Drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to Tay-Sachs GM2-activator protein.,"Low volatility, lipid-like cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by Drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior, but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood. Recently, we showed that the CheB42a protein, which is expressed in only 10 pheromone-sensing taste hairs on the front legs of males, modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to female-specific cuticular hydrocarbons. Here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the CheB gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatory-specific, and occurs in many different, often non-overlapping patterns. Only the Gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatory-specific expression patterns. Unlike Grs, however, expression of all but one CheB gene is sexually dimorphic. Like CheB42a, other CheBs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones. We also show that CheBs belong to the ML superfamily of lipid-binding proteins, and are most similar to human GM2-activator protein (GM2-AP). In particular, GM2-AP residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in CheBs but not in other ML proteins. Finally, CheB42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromone-sensing taste hairs, where pheromones interact with membrane-bound receptors. We propose that CheB proteins interact directly with lipid-like Drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery. Furthermore, as loss of GM2-AP in Tay-Sachs disease prevents degradation of GM2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration, the function of CheBs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons.",,Remaining,0,0

Here we report data from the survey on prevalence of mental disorders (a cross-sectional descriptive study).	The screenings included the following tests administered to 535 subjects: anxiety, depression, dementia, neurosis were measured; recent medical records were compared to survey data for 330 of the same subjects.	The summary of prevalence of mental disorders measured in this study was as follows: anxiety 34.7% (severe), dementia 44.68% (mild), depression 66% (mild), 15.94% (medium), 7.88% (severe), neurosis 66.73% (mild, medium, and severe). Medical records maintained by village physicians since 1960 differed from the results obtained in the present study. A treatment gap was observed between mental health treatment for neurosis, as indicated by medical records, and the diagnostic prevalence of neurosis as measured by the survey instruments: there were three times as many people diagnosed as neurotic in the survey as had been noted in village medical records. Additionally, the unique position of cerebrovascular alteration was established between the mental and somatic factors.	The study demonstrates the successful simultaneous collection of a wide spectrum of data on somatic conditions, mental disorders, and socio-economic status of the subjects. The study showed that 1. patient-centered medical care can simultaneously address both somatic and mental factors; 2. it is possible to decrease the treatment gap in mental health; 3. there is value in systematic collection of data in order to optimize the planning of prevention, health care costs and decision making.",,Remaining,0,0

Older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for face-to-face interviews regarding their interest in being screened for MCI. A short description of MCI adapted from The Alzheimer's Association's 'Fact Sheet' was presented before asking about MCI testing. Multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for MCI. The strongest, most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has Alzheimer disease. Another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past. Older adults appear to have psychologically connected MCI to Alzheimer disease, but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study.",,Remaining,0,0

The majority of treatment for depression occurs in primary care, but effective care remains elusive. Clinical decision making and comparative studies of real-world antidepressant effectiveness are limited by the absence of clinical measures of severity of illness and suicidality.	The Distributed Ambulatory Research in Therapeutics Network (DARTNet) was engaged to systematically collect data using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) at the point of care. We used electronic health records (EHRs) and the PHQ-9 to capture, describe, and compare data on both baseline severity of illness and suicidality and response and suicidality after diagnosis for depressed patients in participating DARTNet practices.	EHR data were obtained for 81,028 episodes of depression (61,464 patients) from 14 clinical organizations. Over 9 months, data for 4900 PHQ-9s were collected from 2969 patients in DARTNet practices (this included 1892 PHQ-9s for 1019 adults and adolescents who had at least one depression diagnosis). Only 8.3% of episodes identified in our depression cohort had severity of illness information available in the EHR. For these episodes, considerable variation existed in both severity of illness (32.05% with no depression, 26.89% with minimal, 19.54% with mild, 12.04% with moderate, and 9.47% with severe depression) and suicidality (69.43% with a score of 0, 22.58% with a score of 1, 4.97% with a score of 2, and 3.02% with a score of 3 on item 9 of the PHQ-9). Patients with an EHR diagnosis of depression and a PHQ-9 (n = 1019) had similar severity but slightly higher suicidality levels compared with all patients for which PHQ-9 data were available. The PHQ-9 showed higher sensitivity for identifying depression response and emergent (after diagnosis) severity and suicidality; 25% to 30% of subjects had some degree of suicidal thought at some point in time according to the PHQ-9.	This study demonstrated the value of adding PHQ-9 data and prescription fulfillment data to EHRs to improve diagnosis and management of depression in primary care and to enable more robust comparative effectiveness research on antidepressants.",,Remaining,0,0

To assess the spatial and temporal expression patterns of transforming growth factor-beta1 and -beta2 (TGF-beta1 and TGF-beta2) in the human spinal cord after traumatic injury.	Germany, Aachen, Aachen University Hospital.	Sections from human spinal cords from 4 control patients and from 14 patients who died at different time points after traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) were investigated immunohistochemically.	In control cases, TGF-beta1 was confined to occasional blood vessels, intravascular monocytes and some motoneurons, whereas TGF-beta2 was only found in intravascular monocytes. After traumatic SCI, TGF-beta1 immunoreactivity was dramatically upregulated by 2 days after injury (the earliest survival time investigated) and was detected within neurons, astrocytes and invading macrophages. The staining was most intense over the first weeks after injury but gradually declined by 1 year. TGF-beta2 immunoreactivity was first detected 24 days after injury. It was located in macrophages and astrocytes and remained elevated for up to 1 year. In white matter tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration, there was no induction of either isoform.	The early induction of TGF-beta1 at the point of SCI suggests a role in the acute inflammatory response and formation of the glial scar, while the later induction of TGF-beta2 may indicate a role in the maintenance of the scar. Neither of these TGF-beta isoforms appears to contribute to the astrocytic scar formation in nerve fibre tracts undergoing Wallerian degeneration.",,Remaining,0,0

The underlying mechanisms of the mental health benefits of green space are not fully understood, but different pathways have been suggested, such as the psychologically restoring capacities of green space, the ability to facilitate physical activity and social cohesion, and the mitigation of exposure to air pollution.	In this nationwide cohort study, we investigated associations between residential green space in early childhood and a clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).	The cohort included individuals, who were born in Denmark between 1992 and 2007 (n=814,689) and followed for a diagnosis of ADHD from age 5, during the period 1997-2016. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) as a measure of vegetation greenness surrounding each residential address in a quadratic area of 210m×210m in which the residence was located in the center of the quadrate. Individual exposure to green space was calculated as the average of NDVI surrounding each individual's residential address (or addresses if more than one) between birth and the fifth birthday. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate the incidence rate ratios (IRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for ADHD, according to exposure level and adjusted for calendar time, age, sex, parental socioeconomic status, neighborhood level socioeconomic status, and urbanicity.	Individuals living in areas defined by sparse green vegetation (lowest decile of NDVI) had an increased risk of developing ADHD, compared with individuals living in areas within the highest decile of NDVI (IRR=1.55; 95% CI: 1.46, 1.65). Adjusting for the known confounders attenuated the result, but the association remained (IRR=1.20; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.28).	Our findings suggest that lower levels of green space in residential surroundings, during early childhood, may be associated with a higher risk of developing ADHD. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6729.",,Remaining,0,0

We investigated an A --> G substitution polymorphism in the 3'-untranslated region of exon 8 (E8) of DRD2 with allele frequencies of f(G) = 0.295 - 0.329.

In addition, E8 A/A was associated with increased suicide attempts and showed a tendency towards more severe withdrawal symptoms, early relapse and reduced responsiveness to the dopaminergic agonist apomorphine. Regression analysis revealed the DRD2 E8 genotype as the only significant factor determining withdrawal severity in female alcoholics.

We used message levels of the growth-associated protein, GAP-43, as a marker of axonal plasticity to examine the hypothesis of defective neuronal plasticity in AD. When all AD cases are combined, the average level of GAP-43 message in area 9 of the AD frontal association cortex was not significantly different from the level in the comparably aged control cortex. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) density revealed that in AD cases with high tangle density average GAP-43 message level was reduced fivefold relative to levels in AD cases with low NFT density. AD cases with low neurofibrillary tangle density had levels of GAP-43 message that were not significantly different from the levels of normal controls. Differentiation of AD cases on the basis of neuritic plaque density did not indicate as strong a relationship to GAP-43 message level. The association between neurofibrillary tangle density and GAP-43 message level suggests the hypothesis that neurofibrillary tangles may reduce GAP-43 expression. Data of others show a relationship between high NFT density and reduced levels of synaptophysin-like immunoreactivity and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism. These data combine to suggest a set of AD cases with high NFT density, reduced axonal plasticity, reduced synaptic density, and reduced cerebral glucose metabolism--all variables that may be directly related to the functioning of the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Remaining,0,0

In total, 62 patients with PVE were enrolled (45 males, 17 females). The patients' age ranged from 23 to 79 years (51.69 ± 15.01). Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) was the most common reason for valve replacement. Of the patients, 58 were found to have vegetations by echocardiography. Blood cultures revealed the most common pathogens to be Staphylococcus (12 cases) and fungal infections (n = 7); 18 (29.03%) patients had strokes. There were 12 cases of ischemic stroke, three cases of cerebral hemorrhage, one case of subarachnoid hemorrhage, and two cases of unclear etiology. The most commonly found clinical symptoms of stroke patients were hemiplegia (n = 10) and coma (n = 5). The five patients in coma died during hospitalization. The incidence of RHD, double valve replacement, atrial fibrillation, and mitral valve vegetation was significantly higher in the stroke group than in the non-stroke group (p = 0.045, 0.000, 0.033, and 0.045, respectively).

The study sought to identify whether individual socio-economic status (as measured by income from lifetime occupation) and community socio-economic status (measured in a number of ways) predicts the onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for individual risk factors (e.g., smoking, obesity and hypertension). Logistic regression results show that individual socio-economic status and all of the community socio-economic status measures predict the onset of stroke before controlling for individual risk factors. However, there is a high correlation between the various measures of community socio-economic status. Stepwise regression results suggest that average household income is the measure of community-level socio-economic status with the greatest predictive power. The results suggest that individual income and average household income are significant predictors of onset of stroke both independently and after controlling for behavioural and medical risk factors. Logistic regression analysis of the pathway suggests that individual income is a significant predictor of smoking and obesity, and that community socio-economic status is a significant predictor of heart disease, heavy drinking, diabetes, smoking and obesity.",,Remaining,0,0

Clinical,Parietal operculum and motor cortex activities predict motor recovery in moderate to severe stroke.,"While motor recovery following mild stroke has been extensively studied with neuroimaging, mechanisms of recovery after moderate to severe strokes of the types that are often the focus for novel restorative therapies remain obscure. We used fMRI to: 1) characterize reorganization occurring after moderate to severe subacute stroke, 2) identify brain regions associated with motor recovery and 3) to test whether brain activity associated with passive movement measured in the subacute period could predict motor outcome six months later. Because many patients with large strokes involving sensorimotor regions cannot engage in voluntary movement, we used passive flexion-extension of the paretic wrist to compare 21 patients with subacute ischemic stroke to 24 healthy controls one month after stroke. Clinical motor outcome was assessed with Fugl-Meyer motor scores (motor-FMS) six months later. Multiple regression, with predictors including baseline (one-month) motor-FMS and sensorimotor network regional activity (ROI) measures, was used to determine optimal variable selection for motor outcome prediction. Sensorimotor network ROIs were derived from a meta-analysis of arm voluntary movement tasks. Bootstrapping with 1000 replications was used for internal model validation. During passive movement, both control and patient groups exhibited activity increases in multiple bilateral sensorimotor network regions, including the primary motor (MI), premotor and supplementary motor areas (SMA), cerebellar cortex, putamen, thalamus, insula, Brodmann area (BA) 44 and parietal operculum (OP1-OP4). Compared to controls, patients showed: 1) lower task-related activity in ipsilesional MI, SMA and contralesional cerebellum (lobules V-VI) and 2) higher activity in contralesional MI, superior temporal gyrus and OP1-OP4. Using multiple regression, we found that the combination of baseline motor-FMS, activity in ipsilesional MI (BA4a), putamen and ipsilesional OP1 predicted motor outcome measured 6 months later (adjusted-R[2] = 0.85; bootstrap p < 0.001). Baseline motor-FMS alone predicted only 54% of the variance. When baseline motor-FMS was removed, the combination of increased activity in ipsilesional MI-BA4a, ipsilesional thalamus, contralesional mid-cingulum, contralesional OP4 and decreased activity in ipsilesional OP1, predicted better motor outcome (djusted-R[2] = 0.96; bootstrap p < 0.001). In subacute stroke, fMRI brain activity related to passive movement measured in a sensorimotor network defined by activity during voluntary movement predicted motor recovery better than baseline motor-FMS alone. Furthermore, fMRI sensorimotor network activity measures considered alone allowed excellent clinical recovery prediction and may provide reliable biomarkers for assessing new therapies in clinical trial contexts. Our findings suggest that neural reorganization related to motor recovery from moderate to severe stroke results from balanced changes in ipsilesional MI (BA4a) and a set of phylogenetically more archaic sensorimotor regions in the ventral sensorimotor trend, in which OP1 and OP4 processes may complement the ipsilesional dorsal motor cortex in achieving compensatory sensorimotor recovery.",,Remaining,0,0

There are limited data on mycobacterial genotypic diversity in children with tuberculous meningitis (TBM). We investigated mycobacterial genotypic diversity in children with TBM and analyzed the relationship among genotype, clinical presentation and outcome.	Data were extracted from an ongoing prospective study on children with confirmed TBM from 1992 through 2003 at a referral hospital in the Western Cape Province, South Africa. Mycobacterial isolates were genotyped by standardized restriction fragment length polymorphism methodology. Clinical data at diagnosis, inflammatory progression during the first month of antituberculosis therapy and neurologic outcomes after 6 months of therapy were analyzed according to the principal genetic group of the strain and the presence of the Beijing strain, respectively.	Fifty-nine children were included (median age at diagnosis, 23 months); 37 presented with stage II and 22 with stage III presented with TBM. At completion of antituberculosis therapy, 6 children were neurologically normal, 22 were moderately neurologically impaired, 23 were severely neurologically impaired and 6 children died; detailed outcomes were not available in 2 children. All 3 principal genetic groups were represented (group 1, 27.1%; group 2, 59.3%; group 3, 13.6%); the most prevalent strains were of the Beijing genotype (family 29; 25.4%), followed by family 28 (10.2%) and family 11 (8.5%). Predictors of poor neurologic outcome included advanced disease at diagnosis and male gender. There was no association between the principal genetic group of the strain or the presence of the Beijing genotype, and clinical presentation or outcome.

This study attempted to screen mutations and to investigate the mutation distribution and related phenotypes including epilepsy of Chinese TSC patients.	We performed the genotypic analysis of TSC1 and TSC2 genes in 77 unrelated Chinese TSC patients using direct Sanger sequencing and Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).	Mutations were identified in a total of 63 (81.8%) cases, including 18 TSC1 mutations (8 nonsense mutations, 6 frameshift, 1 in-frame shift, 1 missense and 2 splice-site) and 45 TSC2 mutations (13 missense, 3 nonsense, 6 splicing, 6 in-frame shift,12 frameshift mutations and 5 large deletions). Large deletions were presented exclusively in TSC2 gene, accounting for 7.9% of all mutations in this study. Fourteen novel mutations were identified in this study.	Epilepsy occurs in approximately 75.3% (58/77) of patients. Hypomelanotic macules occurred significantly more often in patients with TSC2 mutations and cases with TSC1/TSC2 mutations had a significantly higher frequency of cortical nodule than patients with no mutations identified. Overall, our data expands the spectrum of mutations associated with the TSC loci and will be of value to the genetic counseling in patients with the disease.",Genotype-phenotype correlation| MLPA| TSC1| TSC2| Tuberous Sclerosis Complex,Remaining,0,0
389,1882722,Acta neurochirurgica,A comparative study of the Reaction Level Scale (RLS85) with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Edinburgh-2 Coma Scale (modified) (E2CS(M)).,"In this work a new coma scale for the assessment of responsiveness in acute brain disorders, constructed near the year 1985 by Scandinavian investigators, the Reaction Level Scale (RLS85), is compared with two other coma scales namely: (i) the Glasgow Coma Scale: (GCS); (ii) the Edinburgh-2 Coma Scale, after modification: (E2CS(M)). The study proceeded in the form of a statistical analysis of assessments made on 46 patients according to RLS85 and GCS (i.e., when comparison was with GCS) and on 28 patients according to RLS85 and E2CS(M). In all 74 cases two physicians participating as 'observers' carried out the assessments. They were both contacting the patient--not together but--successively within a time interval of less than 20'. Hence the data appeared as 'pairwise' observations for any of the three scales above. The results of the analysis, arising from a rather strict statistical reasoning, can be summarized as follows: (1) The rank correlation coefficient r(s) between: (i) RLS85 and GCS sum score, (ii) RLS85 and E2CS(M), was found to be at a satisfactory level meaning that all three scales indicate almost the same 'ranking order of severity'. (2) Reliability was compared by taking into account as to what extent the two observers agreed on RLS85 and--simultaneously--disagreed on the other scale. The 'sign' test was applied and as a result RLS85 proved to be more reliable than; (i) GCS (EMY profile), (ii) GCS sum score, and (iii) E2CS(M), in all the above mentioned at a high level of significance. (3) Apart from the test above, some values of the index kappa (kappa) of interobserver agreement were calculated. Those corresponding to RLS85 are considerably higher. In particular the overall value based on 74 pairwise assessments amounted to kappa = 0.733 associated with a standard error sigma(kappa) = 0.061. This was a satisfactory result regarding the features of RLS85. (4) As far as coverage is concerned, again--by the 'sign' test--the predominance of RLS85 versus GCS (EMY profile) was accepted.",,Remaining,0,0
390,9268809,Journal of clinical and experimental neuropsychology,The Post-Stroke Depression Rating Scale: a test specifically devised to investigate affective disorders of stroke patients.,"Owing to the lack of instruments specifically constructed to study emotional and affective disorders of stroke patients, the nature of post-stroke depression (PSD) remains controversial. With this in mind, the authors constructed a new scale, the Post-Stroke Depression Scale (PSDS) which takes into account a series of symptoms and problems commonly observed in depressed stroke patients. The PSDS and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDS) were administered to a group of 124 patients, who had been classified, on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria, in the following categories: No depression (n = 32); Minor PSD (n = 47); Major PSD (n = 45). Scores obtained by these stroke patients on the PSDS and on the HDS were compared to those obtained on the same scales by 17 psychiatric patients also classified as major depression on the basis of DSM III-R diagnostic criteria. An analysis of the symptomatological profiles clearly showed that: (1) a continuum exists between the so-called 'major' and 'minor' forms of PSD; (2) in both groups of depressed stroke patients the depressive symptomatology seems due to the psychological reaction to the devastating consequences of stroke, since the motivated aspects of depression prevailed in depressed stroke patients, whereas the (biologically determined) unmotivated aspects prevailed in patients with a functional form of major depression; and (3) in stroke patients a DSM III-based diagnosis of major PSD could be in part inflated by symptoms (such as apathy and vegetative disorders) that are typical of major depression in a patient free from brain damage, but that could be due to the brain lesion per se in a stroke patient.",,Remaining,0,0

PAH gene mutations were examined in 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled in the Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total of 84 different mutations were detected, and complete genotype was obtained in 199 individuals. Based on previous knowledge about mutation-phenotype associations, 78 of the mutations could be assigned to one of four classes of severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, and mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects were grouped according to the various combinations of mutation classifications. The sample sizes were large enough for statistical testing in four groups with at least one mutation that completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients are considered functionally hemizygous.	The biochemical phenotype predicted from the genotype in functionally hemizygous patients was related significantly to the assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) was also significantly related to genotype. The IQ of PAH-deficient mothers with a severe PKU mutation in combination with a MHP mutation or a mild PKU mutation was 99 and 96, respectively, whereas the IQ of PKU mothers with two severe PKU mutations or with one severe and one moderate PKU mutation was 83 and 84, respectively. Of the patients with PKU, 92% had been treated during childhood. Those who were untreated or treated late had lower than average IQ scores for their group of mutation combinations. Females with moderate or mild PKU who were treated early and treated for >6 years showed IQ scores 10 points above average for their group.	The reproductive outcome in maternal phenylketonuria is dependent on prenatal metabolic control and postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend on the intellectual resources of the mother with PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, and cognitive performance observed in the present study is of importance for the development of an optimal strategy for future treatment of females with PKU who plan pregnancy.",,Remaining,0,0

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 is caused by the expansion of an unstable CAG repeat in the first exon of the SCA7 gene.	Clinical and related examinations were performed in all affected or at-risk individuals from 4 Chinese families presenting with autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia and decreased visual acuity. The size of the (CAG)(n) array of the SCA7 gene was detected by polymerase chain reaction, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and related techniques in the 4 families and 67 healthy controls. The relationship between expanded repeat number and age of onset was statistically analyzed.	The SCA7 mutation was identified in 2 families. Clinical study revealed that great variation occurred in the age of onset, initial symptoms, and associated signs. Meanwhile, the analysis of 11 parent-child couples demonstrated the existence of marked anticipation. Some distinct retinal changes were noted in 2 affected patients. All SCA7 patients in our series exhibited expanded CAG repeats, ranging from 44 to 85 repeats, with a strong negative correlation between repeat size and age of onset. Repeat lengths of expanded alleles showed somatic mosaicism in leukocyte DNA. There were some subtle clinical differences between the SCA7-positive and -negative cases.	Clinical variation occurred not only among the SCA7 families but also within the same kindred. Meiotic and mitotic instability of the CAG repeat in the SCA7 gene were demonstrated, and intergenerational instability of the array was associated with the clinical phenomenon of anticipation.

394,2625165,European journal of vascular surgery,Extracranial carotid artery aneurysms.,"Aneurysms of the extracranial carotid arteries are uncommon vascular lesions. During the period 1976 to 1986 we encountered 18 extracranial carotid aneurysms in 14 patients. The aneurysms were atherosclerotic (12 in 9 patients), congenital (3 in 2 patients), mycotic (1) and secondary (false aneurysms) after previous carotid surgery (2 in 2 patients). The patients presented with neurological symptoms (11) or a pulsating mass in the neck (2). In one patient the aneurysm was detected accidentally during angiography. From this study it became clear that 'carotid aneurysm' is not a well defined entity. The 'normal' configuration of the carotid bulb with its usually larger diameter, is in part a cause of the problem of definition. A recently described technique for predicting normal vessel diameters in stenosing lesions of the carotid arteries was retrospectively applied to all our patients with aneurysms. With these measurements, made on standard preoperative angiograms, it was possible to quantify the degree of dilatation, and confirm the diagnosis of aneurysm. Eleven of the 14 patients were operated on without mortality, no neurological deficits were seen as a result of the operation and minimal morbidity occurred in six patients. From this study we conclude that surgical correction of accessible carotid artery aneurysms is a relatively safe procedure and these lesions should be operated on irrespective of symptoms. This is the first report that gives clear guidelines for measuring dilatation of the extracranial carotid arteries and based on these guidelines we suggest criteria for the discrimination between physiological dilatation and pathological aneurysm formation, the latter condition being an indication for operation.",,Remaining,0,0

There was a positive correlation between FeNa and FeK both during and after recovery from the illness but they did not exactly mirror each other in every individual. Urine sodium:potassium ratios were similar during and after recovery from the illness and was related to FeNa. Fractional glucose excretion was zero.

If untreated, WD, which is initially a liver disease, can turn into a multi-systemic disease with neurological involvement. Very few studies have described cognitive impairment in WD. The aim of this study is to report the cognitive profile of 31 treated WD patients.	Patients were classed into two groups using the Unified Wilson Disease Rating Scale (UWDRS): WD patients without neurological signs (WD-N(-)) (n=13), and WD patients with neurological signs (WD-N(+)) (n=18). The patients participated in a neuropsychological assessment evaluating memory, executive function and visuo-spatial abilities.	Both groups performed well for verbal intelligence and episodic memory skills. However, the majority of these patients exhibited altered performance for at least one cognitive test, particularly in the executive domain. The WD-N(+) group performed less well than the WD-N(-) group on cognitive tests involving rapid motor function, abstract thinking, working memory and top-down inhibitory control.	Cognitive impairment in treated WD patients essentially affects executive function involving fronto-striatal circuits. Verbal intelligence and episodic memory abilities seem to be remarkably preserved. Neuropsychological assessment is a valuable tool to evaluate the presence and the consequences of these cognitive impairments in WD patients with or without neurological signs in the course of this chronic disease.",Cognition| Examen neuropsychologique| Executive function| Fonctions exécutives| Maladie de Wilson| Maladie métabolique| Metabolic disease| Neuropsychology| Wilson's disease,Remaining,0,0

Since CARP is induced by pressure overload to the heart, it is proposed to be a genetic marker for cardiac hypertrophy. We recently identified a novel protein, ankyrin repeat protein with PEST and proline-rich region (ARPP), which is homologous to CARP and is preferentially expressed in type 1 skeletal muscle fibers (cf. slow fibers). We also found that both ARPP and CARP expression is induced in experimentally denervated skeletal muscles in mice. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that their expression may be induced in skeletal muscles in neurodegenerating disease. This work aimed to determine the expression pattern of ARPP and CARP in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).	In this study, we immunohistochemically analyzed the expression of ARPP and CARP in skeletal muscles of 9 ALS cases.	We found that CARP was aberrantly expressed in atrophic skeletal muscle fibers in ALS. Although ARPP-positive fibers were randomly scattered in a checkerboard-like pattern in normal skeletal muscle, this pattern was absent in ALS muscles. Furthermore, we also found that ARPP was expressed in fast myosin heavy chain-positive fibers (cf. type 2 fiber).

Of the later, 13 had severe obstructions of the extracranial portion of the carotid artery, four had obstruction of the intracranial portion, and five had severe aortic valve insufficiency (AI), with more than 60% regurgitation in all cases. Measurements could be performed within an accuracy of about +/- 20% under clinical conditions and revealed perfusion values of 5 to 8 ml per second (300 to 480 ml per minute) in healthy persons. Of the patients, values less than 3 ml per second (180 ml per minute) were detected in nine, between 3 and 5 mm per second (180 to 300 ml per minute) in four, and normal values in another four, while significant backflow was observed only in patients with severe AI. Consecutive blood flow profiles were recorded every 4 msec; these demonstratedthat, for a period lasting from 40 msec to 280 msec after the initial systolic peak, blood flow decelerated more rapidly in the central portion of the vessel lumen than near the wall. This situation was present in all healthy persons and in most patients with pathological flow. In patients with AI, flow reinversion from reverse to normal began near the vessel wall, while in the middle third of the vessel lumen, blood was still flowing backward. These phenomena seem to be in agreement with the theoretical and experimental findings of Wormersly, Müller, and others. The AI patients who underwent artificial valve implantation were studied ten days after operation and showed no or little backflow in the common carotid artery at that time.",,Remaining,0,0

The ITT and Brief SST showed no differential effect of AmED versus alcohol (gs < 0.30 and gs < 0.36, respectively). Moderate magnitude improvements in alcohol-induced impairment of CTT and DSST performance were observed after AmED versus alcohol on the descending BrAC limb (gs > 0.45 and gs > 0.37, respectively). A moderate magnitude decrease in DSST errors was also observed after AmED relative to alcohol at 0.050% ascending target BrAC (gs > 0.43).	Changes in cognitive function after AmED administration were dependent on the degree of intoxication, BrAC curve limb, and ED volume. Co-administration of ED doses which matched (500 ml) and exceeded (500 ml) maximum daily intake guidelines with alcohol decreased impairment of psychomotor function and global information processing after alcohol consumption. These results cannot be necessarily interpreted to suggest that people are less impaired after AmED, as behavior is the result of coordination of multiple cognitive functions, and reduced impairment on one aspect of cognition may not translate into global improvements.",Alcohol| Caffeine| Cognition/Drug Effects| Dose-Response Relationship| Energy Drink,Remaining,0,0

The CBFVs, resistive index (RI) and pulsatility index (PI) were measured in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries (ACA and MCA) of 38 normal neonates.	The mean peak systolic, end diastolic and time-averaged velocities (PSV, EDV and TAV) were 36.3 ± 6.6, 12.4 ± 3.9 and 22.0 ± 4.0 cm/s (ACA) and 41.4 ± 13.2, 13.0 ± 5.5 and 25.8 ± 7.9 cm/s (MCA), respectively. All CBFVs in the ACA correlated with gestation; only EDV was correlated to post-natal age. The RI in the ACA (0.67 ± 0.06) and MCA (0.68 ± 0.07) were correlated (r = 0.72, P < 0.001); RI correlated to post-natal age. Two infants with RI < 0.55 were both fed within 25 mins of the study; RI correlated with post-prandial time (dichotomous, pivot 25 min). The mean PI was 1.11 ± 0.18 (ACA) and 1.17 ± 0.23 (MCA). Correlations were observed with post-natal age and post-prandial time (dichotomous). The average angle of insonation was greater in the ACA than in the MCA (median of 5° vs. 18°).	Results corresponded with previous published studies. No correlation was observed between Doppler indices and gestation as component velocities all increase with advancing gestation. Less variation and smaller standard deviation of CBFV's was associated with a smaller angle of insonation.

The objective was to determine and expand the phenotypic spectrum of KCS1 and KCS2 in order to anticipate complications that may arise in these disorders.	We clinically and genetically analyzed 10 KCS2 patients from 7 families. Because we found unusual phenotypes in our cohort, we performed a systematic review of genetically confirmed KCS cases using PubMed and Scopus. Evaluation by 3 researchers led to the inclusion of 26 papers for KCS1 and 16 for KCS2, totaling 205 patients. Data were extracted following the Cochrane guidelines and assessed by 2 independent researchers.	Several patients in our KCS2 cohort presented with intellectual disability (3/10) and chronic kidney disease (6/10), which are not considered common findings in KCS2. Systematic review of all reported KCS cases showed that the phenotypes of KCS1 and KCS2 overlap for postnatal growth retardation (KCS1: 52/52, KCS2: 23/23), low parathyroid hormone levels (121/121, 16/20), electrolyte disturbances (139/139, 24/27), dental abnormalities (47/50, 15/16), ocular abnormalities (57/60, 22/23), and seizures/spasms (103/115, 13/16).

Sixty male psychotic inpatients, legally detained at a forensic unit in New York City, were assessed with semi-structured interviews, supplemented with information from hospital and official records, family members and the treating clinician. Results indicated that in this unique sample of detained persons with psychotic disorders; (1) increase in the severity of community violence is associated with medication non-adherence, all dimensions of poor insight into illness, and several previously reported covariates such as substance use comorbidity; (2) no relationship was found between insight and adherence in this particular sample; (3) multivariate analyses showed that select covariates, along with medication adherence, and select insight domains predicted a total of 73% of the magnitude of ODV behavior in this sample. Overall, medication non-adherence explained a large amount of how violently participants behaved toward others. Since non-adherence was independent of poor insight, it may be more worthwhile for clinicians to develop treatment strategies to target medication adherence without directly addressing an elusive target such as insight into illness. Treatment addressing medication adherence needs to concomitantly target substance use behaviors since the latter was responsible for a substantial increase in ODV.",,Remaining,0,0

Levels of Δ4-androstenedione were significantly associated with 1-month mortality in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals: 1.540 [1.107-2.138)], P = .010). Δ4-androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels were associated with poor outcome in the univariate analysis, that is, combined severe handicap (modified Rankin Scale ≥4) and death, 1 month poststroke, although this was not significant in the multivariate analysis. Adrenal sex steroids, and especially Δ4-androstenedione, are significantly associated with stroke severity on admission and short-term prognosis among female stroke subjects. Well-designed prospective studies will further clarify their role in cerebrovascular disease.",,Remaining,0,0

Participants in the Women's Health Initiative who had Type 2 diabetes and data on depressive symptoms (N=8895) were included in the analyses. In multivariable linear regression models controlling for sociodemographic, medical and psychosocial covariates, we examined the main effect of depressive symptoms, as well as the interactions between depressive symptoms and antidepressant use, and between depressive symptoms and optimism, on sleep disturbance, physical activity, physical health-related quality of life; and global quality of life.	In all, 16% of women with Type 2 diabetes reported elevated depressive symptoms. In multivariable analyses, women with depressive symptoms had greater sleep disturbance (P<0.0001) and lower global quality of life (P<.0001). We found evidence of significant statistical interaction in the models for quality-of-life outcomes: the increased risk of poor physical health-related quality of life associated with antidepressant use was stronger in women without vs with depressive symptoms, and the association between greater optimism and higher global quality of life was stronger in women with vs without depressive symptoms.	To improve health behaviours and quality of life in women with Type 2 diabetes, sociodemographic and medical characteristics may identify at-risk populations, while psychosocial factors including depression and optimism may be important targets for non-pharmacological intervention.",,Remaining,0,0

There have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for GD, although the results have been inconsistent. On the other hand, GD was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude. We aimed to examine the heterogeneity of GD by combining a behavioral economics task and voxel-based morphometry. Thirty-six male GD patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion, which can assess risk attitude in real-life decision-making. The GD patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion, low and high. While both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum, high loss-aversion GD showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our study suggests that the heterogeneity of GD is underpinned at the brain structural level. This result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for GD.",Gambling disorder| Gray matter volume| Loss aversion| Subtypes,Remaining,0,0
409,11781147,Biochimica et biophysica acta,Characterization of a missense mutation at histidine-44 in a pyruvate dehydrogenase-deficient patient.,"Genetic defects in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) cause lactic acidosis, neurological deficits, and often early death. Most mutations of PDC are localized in the alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase (E1) component. We have kinetically characterized a patient's missense mutation alphaH44R in E1alpha by creating and purifying three recombinant human E1s (alphaH44R, alphaH44Q, and alphaH44A). Substitutions at histidine-15 resulted in decreased V(max) values (6% alphaH44R; 30% alphaH44Q; 90% alphaH44A) while increasing K(m) values for thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) compared to wild-type (alphaH44R, 3-fold; alphaH44Q, 7-fold; alphaH44A, 10-fold). This suggests that the volume of the residue at site 15 is important for TPP binding and substitution by a residue with a longer side chain disrupts the active site more than the TPP binding site. The rates of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of alphaH44R E1 by E1-kinase and phospho-E1 phosphatase, respectively, were similar to that of the wild-type E1 protein. These results provide a biochemical basis for altered E1 function in the alphaH44R E1 patient.",,Remaining,0,0

Participants' (N = 12) narratives were initially analyzed utilizing a grounded theory framework as 68 violent incidents were coded for perceived threat and coping levels. Coping strategies were examined from a Transactional Model of Stress and Coping perspective taking into account the context and severity of each violent exposure itself. A comprehensive assessment map was developed to plot and visually reveal participants (N = 12) overall contextualized coping responses. Overall 'coping zone' scores were generated to index perceived threat and coping responses associated with each violent incident described. These scores were then correlated with indicators of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Results indicated that urban children with less optimal coping zone scores across context have a greater likelihood of PTSD than do children who do not.,assessment| contextual coping| post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)| urban children| violence exposure,Remaining,0,0

This study examines this relationship by applying network analysis to a large sample collected at 18-months follow-up in a longitudinal dataset.	One thousand four hundred and eighty-six college students were recruited and completed a set of self-reported questionnaires on empathy, schizotypy, depression, anxiety and stress. Networks were constructed by taking the subscale scores of these measures as nodes and partial correlations between each pair of nodes as edges. Network Comparison Tests were performed to investigate the differences between individuals with high and low schizotypy.	Cognitive and affective empathy were strongly connected with negative schizotypy in the network. Physical and social anhedonia showed high centrality measured by strength, closeness and betweenness while anxiety and stress showed high expected influence. Predictability ranged from 22.4% (personal distress) to 79.9% (anxiety) with an average of 54.4%. Compared with the low schizotypy group, the high schizotypy group showed higher global strength (S = 0.813, p < 0.05) and significant differences in network structure (M = 0.531, p < 0.001) and strength of edges connecting empathy with schizotypy (adjusted ps < 0.05).	Only self-rating scales were used, and disorganized schizotypy was not included.	Our findings suggest that the cognitive and affective components of empathy and dimensions of schizotypy are closely related in the general population and their network interactions may play an important role in individuals with high schizotypy.",Anhedonia| Centrality| Empathy| Network analysis| Network comparison| Schizotypy,Remaining,0,0

Despite growing efforts to understand associations between potential risk factors and outcomes after injury, prognosis is elusive and lacks the inclusion of genetic variables which may convey additional predictive power. This study assessed which factors contribute to pediatric QoL 6 and 18 months post-recruitment in 159 participants (mTBI = 52; orthopedic injury [OI] = 43; typically developing controls [TDC] = 64) aged 18 to 60 months at the time of injury (M = 37.50, SD = 11.69). Family environment, injury characteristics, and child cognitive-behavioral functioning were assessed at 6 months via parent questionnaires and socio-cognitive assessment. QoL was determined using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at both time points. Genetic information (Brain-derived neurotrophic factor [BDNF] genotype) was collected using saliva samples. Hierarchical regression analyses testing biological, family-environmental, injury and cognitive-behavioral factors revealed that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism was a significant independent predictor of better QoL 6 months post-injury in the mTBI group. Lower parental distress significantly and independently predicted higher QoL 18 months after mTBI, and 6 months post-recruitment in the TDC group. At 18 months, models were non-significant for both control groups. Genetic factors involved in neuroplasticity may play an important role in recovery 6 months after mTBI and contribute to outcome via their interplay with environmental factors.

417,33837088,Science advances,C9orf72-derived arginine-containing dipeptide repeats associate with axonal transport machinery and impede microtubule-based motility.,"A hexanucleotide repeat expansion in the C9orf72 gene is the most common genetic cause of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD). How this mutation leads to these neurodegenerative diseases remains unclear. Here, we show using patient stem cell-derived motor neurons that the repeat expansion impairs microtubule-based transport, a process critical for neuronal survival. Cargo transport defects are recapitulated by treating neurons from healthy individuals with proline-arginine and glycine-arginine dipeptide repeats (DPRs) produced from the repeat expansion. Both arginine-rich DPRs similarly inhibit axonal trafficking in adult Drosophila neurons in vivo. Physical interaction studies demonstrate that arginine-rich DPRs associate with motor complexes and the unstructured tubulin tails of microtubules. Single-molecule imaging reveals that microtubule-bound arginine-rich DPRs directly impede translocation of purified dynein and kinesin-1 motor complexes. Collectively, our study implicates inhibitory interactions of arginine-rich DPRs with axonal transport machinery in C9orf72-associated ALS/FTD and thereby points to potential therapeutic strategies.",,Remaining,0,0

To test the hypothesis that visual acuity is impaired in ALS, we compared three measures of visual acuity in ALS patients (n = 25) attending a multidisciplinary ALS clinic and age matched control subjects (n = 25). Bilateral monocular and binocular visual acuities were assessed using high contrast (black letters on white background) and low contrast (2.5%, 1.25% grey letters on white background) visual acuity charts under controlled lighting conditions following refraction. Binocular summation was calculated as the difference between binocular and best monocular acuity scores. There were no associations between binocular or monocular high contrast visual acuity or low contrast visual acuity and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis diagnosis (generalized estimating equation models accounting for age). Binocular summation was similar in both amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects. There was a small magnitude association between increased duration of ALS symptoms and reduced 1.25% low contrast visual acuity. This study does not confirm prior observations of impaired visual acuity in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and does not support this particular measure of visual function for use in broad scale assessment of visual pathway involvement in ALS patients.",,Remaining,0,0

A study in opioid-dependent patients.,"A history of sexual violence has been related to more complex treatment needs in patients with substance use disorders (SUD). Most of the existing studies, however, included patients with various types of SUD, did not examine gender differences and focused on a small range of clinical domains. Our sample consisted of opioid-dependent outpatients treated during a three-year period in a German metropolitan region. The analysis was based on a local case register and included all patients for whom information on lifetime sexual violence was available (N=3531; 68.3% males). In a case-control design, patients with a history of sexual violence were compared to patients without these experiences regarding a wide range of clinical and social factors indicative of potential needs. Almost two thirds (65.6%) of the female patients and 10.9% of the males reported experiences of sexual violence. Victims differed from non-victims across a variety of domains, including more psychiatric symptoms and suicide attempts, more legal problems, financial and family problems, as well as a higher use of services. In contrast to a previous study among alcohol-dependent patients, no gender differences became apparent. Our findings suggest that experiences of sexual violence are an indicator for more complex needs in opioid-dependent patients of both genders.

Ubiquitin-positive neurofibrillary tangles were less numerous than those labelled by Gallyas, anti-tau, Bodian's and Bielschowsky's methods. There were five times more beta A4 deposits than ubiquitin positive plaques. beta A4 deposits could be numerous in cases in which ubiquitin immunolabelling was entirely negative. Bielschowsky's method, silver methenamine and thioflavin S revealed more senile plaques than anti-ubiquitin, whereas anti-tau, Gallyas', Bodian's and Cross' techniques revealed similar numbers. Anti-ubiquitin positive lesions were correlated with the severity of dementia. Compared with other staining methods, sensitivity of anti-ubiquitin was weaker for neurofibrillary tangles than for senile plaques.

All specimens displayed variable expression patterns of chronic low-grade foreign body reactions in the vicinity of the incorporated stent struts as characterized by the appearance of CD68-positive macrophages and mainly CD3- and CD45-R0-positive T lymphocytes. Overwhelming proliferations in relation to intimal hyperplasia can be regarded as the main cause of stent-associated vascular restenosis. After a period of 6 months the expression of factor VIII-positive neoendothelial cells on the luminal surface can be detected in individual cases. Reactions of the vascular wall depend on the state of the underlying atherosclerotic lesions prior to stenting. In cases of predominantly atheromatous soft plaques, the typical reaction pattern triggered by the metallic foreign body pressed into vessel tissue can be absent. In summary, the morphological findings show a chronic tissue reaction in response to stent incorporation.

427,30544301,Journal of neurosurgery,A novel method to determine the natural course of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations without the need for follow-up information.,"OBJECTIVEThere is a strong clinical need to accurately determine the average annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). This need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy. The authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex, pregnancy, AVM volume, and location on the risk for AVM rupture.METHODSThe present study does not consider any specific management of the AVMs, but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage, the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients. For this purpose, the authors collected observations, including age at first hemorrhage and AVM size and location, in 3425 patients. The average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age. For a subset of the patients, the information regarding occurrence of AVM hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from AVM location and pregnancy.RESULTSThe age distribution for the first AVM hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured AVMs at adult ages (25-60 years). It was concluded to be 3.1% ± 0.2% and unrelated to AVM volume but influenced by its location, with the highest risk for centrally located AVMs. The hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile years.CONCLUSIONSThe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first AVM hemorrhage at 3.1% ± 0.2% without the need for individual patient follow-up. This methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations. The conclusion that centrally located AVMs carry a higher risk was confirmed by follow-up information. Follow-up information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater AVM hemorrhage risk. The age distribution for AVM hemorrhage is incompatible with AVMs present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as AVMs in adults. Plausibly, they instead develop in the early years of life, possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period.",AVM| AVM = arteriovenous malformation| GKS = Gamma Knife surgery| hemorrhage| risk| stereotactic radiosurgery| vascular disorders,Remaining,0,0
428,33479201,Translational psychiatry,"Brain dynamics: the temporal variability of connectivity, and differences in schizophrenia and ADHD.","We describe advances in the understanding of brain dynamics that are important for understanding the operation of the cerebral cortex in health and disease. In data from 1017 participants from the Human Connectome Project, we show that early visual and connected areas have low temporal variability of their functional connectivity. We show that a low temporal variability of the connectivity of cortical areas is related to high mean functional connectivity between those areas, and provide an account of how these dynamics arise. We then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders. We find that in both first episode and long-term schizophrenia, reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity, consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing. In ADHD, we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased, and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in ADHD. We further show that these differences in the dynamics of the cortex in schizophrenia, and ADHD can be related to differences in the functional connectivity of the specific sensory vs. association thalamic nuclei.

The 17-item HDRS and MADRS were used to assess the severity of major depressive symptoms on day 3, day 7, and day 14 after admission. The diagnoses of depression were made in accordance with DSM-IV criteria for post-stroke depression (PSD).

Meanwhile, 50 healthy control subjects were also recruited and underwent measurement of serum BDNF and tPA once.	We found that 37 patients (37.0%) were diagnosed of major depression at the end of the follow-up. Serum BDNF on day 1 was significantly higher in non-PSD stroke patients than in normal controls, while PSD patients had significantly lower BDNF than non-PSD patients. There was a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF and tPA on day 1 only in PSD patients (r = -0.440, p = 0.006).

431,22720308,Journal of gastrointestinal and liver diseases : JGLD,The His1069Gln mutation in the ATP7B gene in Romanian patients with Wilson's disease referred to a tertiary gastroenterology center.,"Wilson's disease (WD) is a rare autosomal recessive disease. More than 500 mutations have been described so far, out of which 29 in exon 14. H1069Q mutation in the exon 14 of ATP7B gene is the most frequently encountered in Europe. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the incidence of mutations occurring in exon 14 of ATP7B gene in Romanian patients referred to a tertiary gastroenterology center, with known or suspected WD and in asymptomatic first degree relatives of index cases.	93 patients were included in the study. Exon 14 of ATP7B gene has been amplified by PCR from genomic DNA and mutations identified by sequencing.	Only H1069Q missense mutation was detected in our study group. In patients with an established diagnosis of WD (38 cases), 34.2% were heterozygous for H1069Q and 21.1% were homozygous, with an allelic frequency of 38.1%. In paediatric WD patients (12 cases) 25% were heterozygous and 16.7% were homozygous (not significant versus adult population). Among asymptomatic first degree relatives of patients with WD (12 siblings, 25 parents) there were 40.5% cases heterozygous for H1069Q. In patients with suspected WD (17 cases), only 5.9% were heterozygous and no homozygous patient was identified. In our study group, H1069Q screening alone could not raise the Leipzig score to confirm diagnosis in patients with suspected WD or in asymptomatic first degree relatives.	H1069Q mutation is highly prevalent in Romanian WD patients and first degree relatives, similar to other central and continental western European populations.",,Remaining,0,0

Clinicians may also question service users' ability to make considered decisions about their treatment when in crisis. Therefore, this qualitative study aimed to investigate crisis treatment preferences of a sample of community-dwelling adults with borderline personality disorder.	Participants were 41 adults with borderline personality disorder who had created joint crisis plans during a randomized controlled trial. Data from all 41 joint crisis plans were analyzed iteratively via a thematic analysis framework.	Participants gave clear statements in their crisis plans relating to the desire to recover from the crisis and to improve their social functioning. Key themes included the desire to be treated with dignity and respect and to receive emotional and practical support from clinicians. Many participants spoke of the importance of connecting with others during periods of crisis, but several reported a clear desire to be left alone during a future crisis. Other themes concerned preferences for specific treatment refusals during crises, including particular types of psychotropic medication and involuntary treatment.	The variation of participants' preferences underscores the importance of developing individually tailored crisis plans for people with borderline personality disorder. The need to be treated with dignity and respect and to be given autonomy in decision making--also identified in global surveys of people with severe mental illness--is important to people with borderline personality disorder. Key messages for clinicians, service users, and policy makers, in addition to staff training issues, are discussed.",,Remaining,0,0

Twenty-four ambulatory patients (mean age, 10.0 years) with spastic cerebral palsy who were scheduled for single event multilevel surgery, including distal hamstring lengthening, were included. Preoperatively, peak isometric muscle strength was measured for the hip flexor, hip extensor, knee flexor, and knee extensor muscle groups using a handheld dynamometer, and three-dimensional (3D) gait analysis and gross motor function measure (GMFM) scoring were also performed. Correlations between peak isometric strength and GMFM, gait kinematics, and gait kinetics were analyzed.	Peak isometric muscle strength of all muscle groups was not related to the GMFM score and the gross motor function classification system level. Peak isometric strength of the hip extensor and knee extensor was significantly correlated with the mean pelvic tilt (r=-0.588, p=0.003 and r=-0.436, p=0.033) and maximum pelvic obliquity (r=-0.450, p=0.031 and r=-0.419, p=0.041). There were significant correlations between peak isometric strength of the knee extensor and peak knee extensor moment in early stance (r=0.467, p=0.021) and in terminal stance (r=0.416, p=0.043).	There is no correlation between muscle strength and gross motor function. However, this study showed that muscle strength, especially of the extensor muscle group of the hip and knee joints, might play a critical role in gait by stabilizing pelvic motion and decreasing energy consumption in a flexed knee gait.",Muscle strength| cerebral palsy| gait parameter| gross motor function,Remaining,0,0

Levels of circulating interleukin-18 (IL-18) have been positively correlated with carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and coronary plaque area and have identified IL-18 levels as important predictors of coronary events and cardiovascular mortality. This study aimed to examine the relationship between serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG antibody as a sign of H. pylori infection in patients with carotid atherosclerosis.	The carotid IMT, traditional atherosclerotic risk factors, levels of serum H. pylori-IgG and IL-18 were measured in 573 health checkup examinees.	Serum IL-18 and H. pylori-IgG levels were significantly increased in subjects with increased IMT in comparison with those with normal IMT. In subjects with increased IMT, serum H. pylori-IgG was positively correlated with serum IL-18 (r = .402, p = .002), and the association was independent of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors (β = 0.310, p < .001).

435,28928448,Scientific reports,Intact animacy perception during chase detection in ASD.,"We explored the strength of implicit social inferences in adolescents with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using a chasing paradigm in which participants judged the absence/presence of a chase within a display of four seemingly randomly moving dots. While two of these dots always moved randomly, the two others could fulfill the role of being either the chasing (wolf) or chased (sheep) dot. In the chase-present (but not the chase-absent) trials the wolf displayed chasing behavior defined by the degree to which the dot reliably moved towards the sheep (chasing subtlety). Previous research indicated that chasing subtlety strongly influenced chase detection in typically developing (TD) adults. We intended to replicate and extend this finding to adolescents with and without ASD, while also adding either a social or a non-social cue to the displays. Our results confirmed the importance of chasing subtlety and indicated that adding social, but not non-social, information further improved chase detection performance. Interestingly, the performance of adolescents with ASD was less dependent on chasing subtlety than that of their TD counterparts. Nonetheless, adolescents with and without ASD did not differ in their use of the added social (or non-social) cue.",,Remaining,0,0

The study provides a portrait of the spheres of influences that directly and indirectly promote HIV risk-taking behaviors, women's efforts toward protecting themselves, and reported sexual behaviors. The study documents the far-reaching effects of crack addiction. One-and-a-half-hour interviews were conducted with 14 inmates recovering from crack addiction. The women were aged 19 to 39, and 13 were African American. The results of this study suggest that women's addictions are greatly shaped by their family and intimate relationships. Addictive behavior often precluded safer sex behaviors and increased a woman's likelihood of engagement in HIV-risky behaviors. Many women were victims of childhood and adulthood sexual and physical victimization. Women sought to protect themselves through sexual self-protection strategies, although these measures were often not effective HIV risk-reduction strategies.",,Remaining,0,0

Given the relatively recent inclusion of the LPE specifier in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fundamental information is still unknown about LPE, such as how common the different domains are, how much they overlap with one another, whether they predict unique variance from each other, and the potential for the LPE specifier as a transdiagnostic facet of externalizing problems. Caregivers (n = 1,50) of children (Mage = 8.42, SD = 2.31) completed a questionnaire assessing individual LPE domains and measures of externalizing symptoms. Results showed that LPE specifier domains were highly related but separable. All LPEs were uniquely associated with oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), CD, and overall impairment after controlling for other LPE items, child sex, and ADHD symptoms. Being unconcerned about performance, emotionally manipulative, and having shallow/deficient affect were uniquely associated with ADHD while controlling for ODD and CD symptomatology. Our findings fit with the historical conceptualization of LPE as a unidimensional construct and contributes to the growing evidence of the potential utility of assessing LPE across externalizing disorders in children.

439,23270420,Behavioral and brain functions : BBF,Genetic association between APOE*4 and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease is dependent on the psychosis phenotype.,"Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis are prevalent in patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers, patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them. The identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in AD. The E4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is a well-documented risk factor for the development of AD. However, genetic association studies of the APOE 4 allele and BPS in AD have produced conflicting findings.	This study investigates the association between APOE and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of clinically well-characterized subjects with probable AD (n=790) who were systematically evaluated using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) Behavioral Rating Scale for Dementia (BRSD).	Our study found that hallucinations were significantly more likely to occur in subjects with no APOΕ4 alleles than in subjects with two Ε4 alleles (15% of subjects and 5% of subjects, respectively; p=.0066), whereas there was no association between the occurrence of delusions, aberrant motor behavior, or agitation and the number of Ε4 alleles. However, 94% of the subjects with hallucinations also had delusions (D+H).	These findings suggest that in AD the Ε4 allele is differentially associated with D+H but not delusions alone. This is consistent with the hypothesis that distinct psychotic subphenotypes may be associated with the APOE allele.",,Remaining,0,0

PD subjects show abnormal staining for Escherichia coli and α-synuclein in the colon.	We recruited 52 PD patients and 36 healthy cohabitants. We measured serum markers and quantified the numbers of 19 fecal bacterial groups/genera/species by quantitative RT-PCR of 16S or 23S rRNA. Although the six most predominant bacterial groups/genera/species covered on average 71.3% of total intestinal bacteria, our analysis was not comprehensive compared to metagenome analysis or 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing.	In PD, the number of Lactobacillus was higher, while the sum of analyzed bacteria, Clostridium coccoides group, and Bacteroides fragilis group were lower than controls. Additionally, the sum of putative hydrogen-producing bacteria was lower in PD. A linear regression model to predict disease durations demonstrated that C. coccoides group and Lactobacillus gasseri subgroup had the largest negative and positive coefficients, respectively. As a linear regression model to predict stool frequencies showed that these bacteria were not associated with constipation, changes in these bacteria were unlikely to represent worsening of constipation in the course of progression of PD. In PD, the serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein levels were lower than controls, while the levels of serum diamine oxidase, a marker for intestinal mucosal integrity, remained unchanged in PD.	The permeability to LPS is likely to be increased without compromising the integrity of intestinal mucosa in PD. The increased intestinal permeability in PD may make the patients susceptible to intestinal dysbiosis. Conversely, intestinal dysbiosis may lead to the increased intestinal permeability. One or both of the two mechanisms may be operational in development and progression of PD.",,Remaining,0,0

Between 2015 and 2018, 14,674 patients with ischemic stroke or TIA within 7 days and older than 18 years from the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III) were included in this analysis. Diabetes duration at baseline was collected by face-to-face interviews and further categorized into groups of without diabetes, diabetes < 4, 4 to <8 and ≥8 years. The association between diabetes duration and clinical outcomes, including stroke recurrence, poor function outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3-6), and all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up after stroke onset, was evaluated by a multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression model, competing risk model and logistic regression model with adjustment for demographic and clinical features.	Among the 14,674 patients included, the average age was 62.0 years, and 68.5% were male. There were 1419 (9.7%) patients who had stroke recurrence, 1912 (13.0%) who had poor function outcome, and 478 (3.3%) who had all-cause mortality at the 1-year follow-up.

This case-control study performed in a US clinical sample of heavy drinkers, replicates the previously reported association between ALD and rs738409 polymorphism in the PNPLA3 gene in heavy drinkers. This association persisted after accounting for the subject's diabetes status.	Patients of European ancestry with a history of ALD were identified (n = 169). Controls consisted of patients without ALD who were from the same cohorts and were ≥ 30 years of age, had lifetime total years drinking ≥20 and lifetime maximum drinks per day ≥12 (n = 259). Patients were genotyped for 40 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) selected for the purpose of testing their association with ALD. The association of each SNP with ALD was tested using a logistic regression model, assuming log-additive allele effects. Bonferroni correction was applied and multivariable logistic regression models were used to account for relevant covariates.	Age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) distributions were similar between cases and controls. Diabetes was more prevalent in the ALD cases.

453,33771822,BMJ open,Predictors of controlled prescription drug non-medical and lifetime use among patients accessing public mental health services in Uganda: a cross-sectional study.,"We determined the prevalence of controlled prescription drug (CPD) non-medical and lifetime use and their predictors among patients at three public psychiatric clinics in Uganda to identify missed care opportunities, enhanced screening priorities, and drug control needs.	A cross-sectional survey of 1275 patients was performed from November to December 2018. Interviewer-administered semi-structured questionnaires, desk review guide and urine drug assays were employed. Questionnaire recorded CPD non-medical and illicit drug use history from patients' files, CPD lifetime use and risk factors. Desk review guide recorded recently prescribed drugs in patients' files to corroborate with urine assays. Predictors were analysed by multivariate logistic regression.	From desk review, 145 (11.4%) patients had history of CPD non-medical use and 36 (2.8%) had used illicit drugs. Of 988 patients who provided urine, 166 (16.8%) self-medicated CPDs, particularly benzodiazepines while 12 (1.2%) used illicit drugs. Of those with drug-positive urine, 123 (69.1%) had no documented history of CPD non-medical and illicit drug use. Being an inpatient (OR=10.90, p<0.001) was independently associated with CPD non-medical use. Additionally, being an inpatient (OR=8.29, p<0.001) and tobacco consumption (OR=1.85, p=0.041) were associated with CPD non-medical and illicit drug use combined. Among participants, 119 (9.3%) reported CPD lifetime use, and this was independently associated with education level (OR=2.71, p<0.001) and history of treatment for substance abuse (OR=2.08, p=0.018).	CPD non-medical use is common among Uganda's psychiatric patients, and more prevalent than illicit drug use. Rapid diagnostic assays may be needed in psychiatric care in resource limited settings. It is necessary to assess how CPD non-medical use impacts mental care outcomes and patient safety. High risk groups like inpatients and tobacco consumers should be prioritised in psychiatric screening.",clinical pharmacology| clinical physiology| forensic medicine| mental health| psychiatry| substance misuse,Remaining,0,0
454,11393460,Journal of personality assessment,The effects of MMPI-A T-score elevation on classification accuracy for normal and clinical adolescent samples.,"In this investigation we examined the ability of the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-Adolescent (MMPI-A; Butcher et al., 1992) to classify accurately both clinical and normal adolescents using 2 different T-score elevation ranges, T > or = 60 and T > or = 65, and using 2 different clinical base rates for the occurrence of psychopathology. A clinical base rate of 50% and 20%, respectively, were created by comparing a clinical sample of 203 adolescent inpatients with cooccurring substance abuse and psychiatric disorders with 2 subsamples from the MMPI-A normative group. These subsamples consisted of 203 adolescents matched for sex and age, and a larger subsample of 1,015 adolescents proportionately matched for sex and age, with the clinical group. Classification accuracy analyses revealed that although clinical base rate did affect the accurate classification of cases, a T-score cutoff of 65 resulted in higher levels of accurate classification overall while minimizing the misclassification of both clinical and normal cases. Implications of these findings for the recommended use of the MMPI-A 'gray zone' are presented, and the relative areas of strength and weakness of the MMPI-A are reviewed in the identification and description of psychopathology.",,Remaining,0,0
455,25731774,Neuro-oncology,Identification and functional prediction of mitochondrial complex III and IV mutations associated with glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor in adults, with a dismal prognosis. Treatment is hampered by GBM's unique biology, including differential cell response to therapy. Although several mitochondrial abnormalities have been identified, how mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations contribute to GBM biology and therapeutic response remains poorly described. We sought to determine the spectrum of functional complex III and IV mtDNA mutations in GBM.	The complete mitochondrial genomes of 10 GBM cell lines were obtained using next-generation sequencing and combined with another set obtained from 32 GBM tissues. Three-dimensional structural mapping and analysis of all the nonsynonymous mutations identified in complex III and IV proteins was then performed to investigate functional importance.	Over 200 mutations were identified in the mtDNAs, including a significant proportion with very low mutational loads. Twenty-five were nonsynonymous mutations in complex III and IV, 9 of which were predicted to be functional and affect mitochondrial respiratory chain activity. Most of the functional candidates were GBM specific and not found in the general population, and 2 were present in the germ-line. Patient-specific maps reveal that 43% of tumors carry at least one functional candidate.	We reveal that the spectrum of GBM-associated mtDNA mutations is wider than previously thought, as well as novel structural-functional links between specific mtDNA mutations, abnormal mitochondria, and the biology of GBM. These results could provide tangible new prognostic indicators as well as targets with which to guide the development of patient-specific mitochondrially mediated chemotherapeutic approaches.",functional prediction| glioblastoma| mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation| structural analysis| subgrouping,Remaining,0,0
456,28849573,"Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)",Functional Network Disruptions in Schizophrenia.,"It has been long recognized that schizophrenia, unlike certain other mental disorders, appears to be delocalized, i.e., difficult to attribute to a dysfunction of a few specific brain areas, and may be better understood as a disruption of brain's emergent network properties. In this chapter, we focus on topological properties of functional brain networks obtained from fMRI data, and demonstrate that some of those properties can be used as discriminative features of schizophrenia in multivariate predictive setting. While the prior work on schizophrenia networks has been primarily focused on discovering statistically significant differences in network properties, this work extends the prior art by exploring the generalization (prediction) ability of network models for schizophrenia, which is not necessarily captured by such significance tests. Moreover, we show that significant disruption of the topological and spatial structure of functional MRI networks in schizophrenia (a) cannot be explained by a disruption to area-based task-dependent responses, i.e., indeed relates to the emergent properties, (b) is global in nature, affecting most dramatically long-distance correlations, and (c) can be leveraged to achieve high classification accuracy (93%) when discriminating between schizophrenic vs. control subjects based just on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task.",Classification| Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)| Functional networks| Multivariate predictive modeling| Predictive features| Schizophrenia,Remaining,0,0

Using a standard recognition memory task, we conducted a pilot study to examine how 24 hours of tobacco abstinence in moderate to heavy smokers would affect memory in males and females. Twenty-five moderate to heavy smokers were tested following a period of smoking normally and following 24 hours of tobacco abstinence. At each session, participants completed a recognition memory task in which items were studied under full- and divided-attention conditions (a standard manipulation of memory encoding) as well as tests of passive short-term and working memory (forward and backward digit span). Tobacco abstinence significantly reduced memory performance under full attention conditions for males but not for females. A significant main effect of smoking status in which abstinence significantly reduced performance, as well as a main effect of encoding condition (divided attention < full attention), were found. Our results demonstrate that there may be substantial sex differences in the cognitive effects of tobacco abstinence. While preliminary, the data suggest the need for further, more extensive study of how males and females differ during tobacco abstinence. Such information will inform the best strategies for tobacco cessation efforts.",,Remaining,0,0

This study aims to investigate whether anxiety sensitivity traits are related to obsessive-compulsive symptoms in the general population and whether the relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms is mediated by metacognition.	Non-clinical volunteers (N = 156, mean age: 23.97, 121 females) completed measures related to state/trait anxiety, anxiety sensitivity, obsessive compulsive symptoms and metacognition.	A direct relationship between anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms was established. Further analysis revealed that metacognition was the strongest mediator of this relationship, even when accounting for state and trait anxiety.	Results suggest that the relationships between traits of anxiety sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive symptoms are partially attributable to the role of metacognition.",Anxiety sensitivity| Metacognition| Obsessive compulsive symptoms| State anxiety| Trait anxiety,Remaining,0,0

Unlike specialized cells, these cells can proliferate several times to produce millions of cells. Nowadays, pluripotent stem cells are important candidates to provide a renewable source for the replacement of cells in tissues of interest. The damage to neurons and glial cells in the brain or spinal cord is present in neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinal cord injury, lysosomal storage disorder, epilepsy, and glioblastoma. Therefore, stem cell transplantation can be used as a novel therapeutic approach in cases of brain and spinal cord damage. Recently, researchers have generated neuron-like cells and glial-like cells from embryonic stem cells, mesenchymal stem cells, and neural stem cells. In addition, several experimental studies have been performed for developing stem cell transplantation in brain tissue. Herein, we focus on stem cell therapy to regenerate injured tissue resulting from neurological diseases and then discuss possible differentiation pathways of stem cells to the renewal of neurons.",Huntington’s disease| Stem cells| injured brain| neurological disorders| pluripotent| spinal cord,Remaining,0,0

We performed a systematic analysis of 12 autosomal-dominant PD (AD-PD) genes (SNCA, LRRK2, GIGYF2, VPS35, EIF4G1, DNAJC13, CHCHD2, HTRA2, NR4A2, RIC3, TMEM230, and UCHL1) using panel sequencing and database filtration in a case-control study of a cohort of 391 Chinese sporadic PD patients and unrelated controls. We evaluated the association between candidate variants and sporadic PD using gene-based analysis.	Overall, 18 rare variants were discovered in 18.8% (36/191) of the index patients. In addition to previously reported pathogenic mutations (LRRK2 p.Arg1441His and p.Ala419Val), another four unknown variants were found in LRRK2, which also contribute to PD risk (p = 0.002; odds ratio (OR) = 7.83, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 1.76-34.93). The cumulative frequency of undetermined rare variants was significantly higher in PD patients (14.1%) than in controls (3.5%) (p = 0.0002; OR=4.54, 95% CI = 1.93-10.69).	Our results confirm the strong impact of LRRK2 on the risk of sporadic PD, and also provide considerable evidence of the existence of additional undetermined rare variants in AD-PD genes that contribute to the genetic etiology of sporadic PD in a Chinese cohort.",Parkinson's disease| autosomal-dominant genes| gene-based analysis| rare variants| sporadic,Remaining,0,0

PDD participants' baseline neuropsychological test scores were compared to the baseline performance of 18 patients with PD who did not meet criteria for dementia at one-year follow-up (PDND) and 18 normal controls (NC). The three groups were matched on baseline demographic and disease variables. Relative to the PDND group, the incident PDD participants demonstrated significantly poorer performance on digits backward (Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised), word list learning and recognition (California Verbal Learning Test), and perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test. Each of these baseline neuropsychological variables exhibited adequate diagnostic classification accuracy in predicting PDD and PDND group membership at follow-up. These results suggest that subtle frontal/executive dysfunction is evident during the immediate PDD prodrome and may be of prognostic value in identifying PD patients at risk for dementia. Accordingly, neuropsychological evaluation may facilitate early identification of PDD and thereby inform appropriate dispositional planning.",,Remaining,0,0

Abnormal methylation status of gene promoters of oxytonergic system has been implicated as among the etiologic factors of ASDs. We, therefore, investigated the methylation frequency of oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) promoter from peripheral blood samples of children with autistic features. Our sample includes 66 children in total (22-94 months); 27 children with ASDs according to the DSM-IV-TR and the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and 39 children who do not have any autistic like symptoms as the healthy control group. We investigated the DNA methylation status of OXTR promoter by methylation specific enzymatic digestion of genomic DNA and polymerase chain reaction. A significant relationship has been found between ASDs and healthy controls for the reduction of methylation frequency of the regions MT1 and MT3 of OXTR. We could not find any association in the methylation frequency of MT2 and MT4 regions of OXTR. Although our findings indicate high frequency of OXTR promoter hypomethylation in ASDs, there is need for independent replication of the results for a bigger sample set. We expect that future studies with the inclusion of larger, more homogeneous samples will attempt to disentangle the causes of ASDs.",Autism spectrum disorders| DNA methylation| epigenetics| oxytocin receptor gene| pervasive developmental disorder,Remaining,0,0

In clinical groups with elevated risk of suicidal tendencies, both the negative factors and psychological variables that can protect a person should be analyzed. The aims of the current study were analysis of purpose in life function in perceived quality of life-self-efficacy and life satisfaction among people suffering from depression in comparison with control group and analysis of escape from self (EfS)-function as an indicator of suicidal thoughts occurrence, for suicide attempt and perceived quality of life (life satisfaction). Two studies were conducted on two clinical groups. The first study consists of females, 20 of them with depression and 40 without depression disorder as a control group. Measures used in this study are Purpose in Life Scale, General Self-Efficacy Scale, and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). The second study consists of 60 participants, including 20 who attempted suicide. Measures used in this study are SWLS Scale and an EfS measure. There is a significant meaning of the sense of purpose of life for well-being and self-efficacy. The ability to maintain the feeling of sense of one's existence seems to be a significant factor that protects from a decrease in life quality and keeps the feeling of being able to deal in difficult situations, as well as helps to accept depression symptoms.",,Remaining,0,0

MATERIAL AND METHODS The study included a total of 79 patients with ADHD or ASDs and controls in the Van region of Turkey. The control group included subjects of matching age and sex with no ADHD, ASDs, or chronic disease and taking no vitamins. The hematological parameters of the patients, including MPV, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, were assessed. RESULTS The study included a total of 79 children and adolescents aged 2-18 years (32 females and 47 males). Of the patients, 36 were in the ADHD group, 18 in the ASDs group, and 25 in the control group. There was no statistically significant difference in hematological parameters between the groups, but there were significant differences in terms of vitamin D and vitamin B12. The patient groups showed lower levels of vitamin B12 and vitamin D. In the ADHD group, there was a negative correlation between both vitamins and MPV (p<0.05). Partial correlation analysis of the ADHD group showed that MPV in particular was negatively correlated to vitamin D, and not to vitamin B12 (p: 0.03). CONCLUSIONS Both ADHD and ASDs may accompany increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to the presence of vitamin B12 and D deficiency and their own characteristics. Therefore, these disorders should be closely followed up.",,Remaining,0,0
465,10490713,American journal of medical genetics,Evaluation of a screening questionnaire for genetic studies of Parkinson's disease.,"A screening questionnaire with high sensitivity for detection of Parkinson's disease would make it easier to identify undiagnosed, yet affected, family members for genetic research. We assessed the validity of a screening questionnaire developed by Duarte et al. [1995: Mov Disord 10:643-649] with reported high specificity and sensitivity for Parkinson's disease (PD). We applied the questionnaire to 78 asymptomatic members of families that had at least two people diagnosed with PD. These families were participating in a linkage study of Parkinson's disease. Examination of these 78 revealed that 53 were normal (normal controls) and 25 were classified ('undiagnosed' PD defined) as possible, probable, or clinically definite PD based on standardized criteria. We compared these results with 123 patients with clinically definite PD ('diagnosed' PD). There were significant differences among the mean scores on the questionnaire for normal controls (4.4), subjects with undiagnosed PD (9.8), and patients with diagnosed PD (42.1; p<0.000001) and a significant difference between undiagnosed PD and normals (p<0.01). The questionnaire had only 4% sensitivity for detection of parkinsonism in undiagnosed PD using the original criteria [Duarte et al., 1995]. Revising the criteria increased the sensitivity from 4 to 48% in the undiagnosed group. The positive predictive value was 39% and the negative predictive value was 72%. Prospective application of these revised criteria is necessary to confirm the improved sensitivity. However, we conclude that this screening questionnaire has inadequate sensitivity for detection of mild parkinsonism and direct examination is still critical for accurate classification for genetic studies.",,Remaining,0,0

This cross-sectional study involved 163 patients having been hospitalised for at least 24 hours. The patients were asked to fill in a satisfaction questionnaire previously approved by the Greek Ministry of Health. Four aspects of satisfaction were investigated (medical, hotel accommodation/ organisational facilities, nursing, global). Using Principal Component Analysis, summated scales were formed and tested for internal consistency using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. The non parametric Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was also used and the threshold p-value for statistical significance (2-sided) was set at 0.05.	The results revealed a high degree of global satisfaction (73.31%), yet satisfaction was higher for the medical (88.88%) and nursing (84.26%) services. Moreover, satisfaction derived from the accommodation facilities and the general organisation was found to be more limited (74.17%). Statistically significant differences (based on various demographic variables) in the participants' global satisfaction were not observed. On the contrary, self-assessment of health status at admission was negatively correlated with medical (r(s)=-0.157, p=0.045) and nursing (r(s)=-0.168, p=0.032) satisfaction. Greek citizenship contributed to bigger satisfaction scores in the accommodation/organisational facilities dimension (r(s)=0.158, p=0.044). Finally, age was positively linked to nursing satisfaction (r(s)=0.181, p=0.02).

Costs associated with RxO abuse were grouped into healthcare, criminal justice, and workplace categories. Costs were estimated by either (1) a quantity method that multiplies the number of RxO abusers derived from various national surveys by the estimated per abuser cost, or (2) an apportionment method that starts with overall (ie, prescription and nonprescription) drug abuse costs for a cost component (eg, police protection) and apportions the share of costs based on the prevalence of RxO abuse relative to overall drug abuse. Medical costs in excess of those for otherwise similar nonabusers were based on an analysis of a large administrative claims database for an employed population using multivariate regression methods.	A lower bound estimate of the costs of RxO abuse in the United States was 8.6 billion dollars in 2001 (or 9.5 billion dollars in 2005 dollars). Of this amount, 2.6 billion dollarswere healthcare costs, 1.4 billion dollars were criminal justice costs, and 4.6 billion dollars were workplace costs.

468,22880116,PloS one,The cortical signature of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,"The aim of this study was to explore the pattern of regional cortical thickness in patients with non-familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and to investigate whether cortical thinning is associated with disease progression rate. Cortical thickness analysis was performed in 44 ALS patients and 26 healthy controls. Group differences in cortical thickness and the age-by-group effects were assessed using vertex-by-vertex and multivariate linear models. The discriminatory ability of MRI variables in distinguishing patients from controls was estimated using the Concordance Statistics (C-statistic) within logistic regression analyses. Correlations between cortical thickness measures and disease progression rate were tested using the Pearson coefficient. Relative to controls, ALS patients showed a bilateral cortical thinning of the primary motor, prefrontal and ventral frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, insula, superior and inferior temporal and parietal regions, and medial and lateral occipital areas. There was a significant age-by-group effect in the sensorimotor cortices bilaterally, suggesting a stronger association between age and cortical thinning in ALS patients compared to controls. The mean cortical thickness of the sensorimotor cortices distinguished patients with ALS from controls (C-statistic ≥ 0.74). Cortical thinning of the left sensorimotor cortices was related to a faster clinical progression (r = -0.33, p = 0.03). Cortical thickness measurements allowed the detection and quantification of motor and extramotor involvement in patients with ALS. Cortical thinning of the precentral gyrus might offer a marker of upper motor neuron involvement and disease progression.",,Remaining,0,0
469,29076783,Journal of neurosurgery,Systematic histopathological analysis of different 5-aminolevulinic acid-induced fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed glioblastomas.,"OBJECTIVE Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by distinct intratumoral histopathological heterogeneity with regard to variable tumor morphology, cell proliferation, and microvascularity. Maximum resection of a GBM results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases. Fluorescence-guided surgery using 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a GBM. Three intratumoral fluorescence levels (i.e., strong, vague, or no fluorescence) can usually be distinguished during surgery. So far, however, their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently. Thus, the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed GBMs with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters. METHODS This prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5-ALA fluorescence-guided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected GBM. Each patient received 5-ALA approximately 3 hours before surgery, and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5-ALA-induced fluorescence. During surgery, tissue samples with strong, vague, or no fluorescence were collected. For each sample, the presence of tumor tissue, quality of tissue (compact, infiltrative, or no tumor), histopathological criteria of malignancy (cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and presence of microvascular proliferation/necrosis), proliferation rate (MIB-1 labeling index [LI]), and microvessel density (using CD34 staining) were investigated. RESULTS Altogether, 77 patients with a newly diagnosed, histopathologically confirmed GBM were included, and 131 samples with strong fluorescence, 69 samples with vague fluorescence, and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected. Tumor tissue was detected in all 131 (100%) of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 (94%) of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence. However, mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 (49%) of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence. Strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 (83%) of 131 samples, whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 (64%) of 69 samples. In terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy, a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed (p < 0.001). Furthermore, the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong (MIB-1 LI 28.3%), vague (MIB-1 LI 16.7%), and no (MIB-1 LI 8.8%) fluorescence (p < 0.001). Last, a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence (CD34 125.5 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) than in those with vague (CD34 82.8 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) or no (CD34 68.6 vessels/0.25 mm[2]) fluorescence (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Strong and vague 5-ALA-induced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed GBM. Despite the lack of fluorescence, tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases. To overcome this current limitation, the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further.",5-ALA| 5-ALA = 5-aminolevulinic acid| CE = contrast enhancement| DTI = diffusion tensor imaging| GBM = glioblastoma| IDH1 = isocitrate dehydrogenase 1| LI = labeling index| NPV = negative predictive value| PPV = positive predictive value| PpIX = protoporphyrin IX| fMRI = functional MRI| fluorescence| glioblastoma| histopathology| microvessel density| oncology| proliferation rate,Remaining,0,0

The survey included questions about nutritional knowledge, opinions of the food service, frequency of feeding assistance provided and feeding assessment practices.	Nutritional knowledge scores ranged from 1 to 9 of a possible 10, with a mean score of 4.67. While 76% of respondents correctly identified risk factors associated with malnutrition in nursing home residents, only 38% of participants correctly identified the need for increased protein and energy in residents with pressure ulcers, and just 15% exhibited correct knowledge of fluid requirements. Further, while nutritional assessment was considered an important part of practice by 83% of respondents, just 53% indicated that they actually carried out such assessments. Identified barriers to promoting optimal nutrition included insufficient time to observe residents (56%); being unaware of residents' feeding issues (46%); poor knowledge of nutritional assessments (44%); and unappetising appearance of food served (57%).	An important step towards improving health and quality of life for residents of aged care facilities would be to enhance staff nutritional awareness and assessment skills. This should be carried out through increased attention to both preservice curricula and on-the-job training.	The residential facility staff surveyed demonstrated low levels of nutrition knowledge, which reflects findings from the international literature. This has implications for the provision of responsive care to residents of these facilities and should be explored further.",malnutrition| mealtime practices| nutrition knowledge| old age| residential care| staff,Remaining,0,0
475,3699998,The International journal of neuroscience,Another look at VIQ-PIQ scores and unilateral brain damage.,"The relationship of WAIS, VIQ, PIQ and Aphasia Screening scores to unilateral brain damage was investigated using 18 subjects with left hemisphere damage (LHD) and 19 subjects with right hemisphere damage (RHD). Expected VIQ-PIQ difference scores were demonstrated only for the RHD subjects. Aphasia was significantly associated with PIQ in the LHD group. ANCOVAR using Aphasia Screening as a covariate produced significant LHD versus RHD differences on PIQ. These data question the utility of VIQ-PIQ difference scores in the diagnosis of unilateral brain damage. Second, the data suggest that LHD 'non-verbal' deficits are the result of underlying language disturbance and not the consequence of impaired visuoperceptive or visuospatial processes.",,Remaining,0,0
476,35337924,Journal of affective disorders,Symptomatic plaque enhancement is associated with early-onset post-stroke depression.,"The association between imaging features closely associated with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic plaques and early-onset post-stroke depression (PSD) is currently unclear.	76 ischemic stroke patients who underwent high-resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging (HR-VWI) were divided into PSD and non-PSD groups according to their DSM-V diagnoses and HAMD-17 scores at 14 days after onset. Clinical data and the imaging features associated with symptomatic plaques (including the enhancement index (EI), remodeling index, and plaque surface irregularity) were compared between groups. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to find independent predictors of early-onset PSD. Spearman rank correlation analysis explores the association between clinical data, symptomatic plaque imaging features, and HAMD-17 in patients.	The sample comprised 36 patients with early-onset PSD. The symptomatic plaque EI and infarct volume were significantly higher in depressed patients than in patients without depression (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression showed that symptomatic plaque EI could be used as an independent predictor of early-onset PSD after correcting for the confounding factor of infarct volume (OR = 1.034, 95% CI:1.014-1.055, P = 0.001). In the total sample, symptomatic plaque EI, infarct volume, and HAMD-17 had a significant positive correlation with each other (P < 0.05).	This study focused only on the patients' symptomatic plaques and did not monitor patients' systemic inflammation levels at the time of HR-VWI.	The degree of symptomatic plaque enhancement is an independent predictive imaging marker of early-onset PSD and can be used the early diagnosis of early-onset PSD.",Atherosclerosis| High resolution vessel wall magnetic resonance imaging| Imaging markers| Post-stroke depression| Symptomatic plaque,Remaining,0,0

478,20300735,Psychopharmacology,Altered parahippocampal functioning in cannabis users is related to the frequency of use.,"Converging lines of evidence suggest an association between cannabis use and impaired episodic memory as well as related associative learning. These deficits have been associated with the duration, frequency, and age of onset of cannabis use. However, it remains unclear whether these parameters of use differently impact memory-related hippocampal functioning.	Forty-two cannabis users were examined by means of functional magnetic resonance imaging while they encoded and retrieved face-profession associations. Region of interest analysis was subsequently used to compare (para-)hippocampal functioning in users with (1) a longer and shorter duration of use, (2) a higher and lower frequency of use, and (3) an earlier and later onset. To further separate the effects of these parameters of use on performance and (para-)hippocampal activity, linear regression analysis was applied.	Compared to low-frequency users, high-frequency users displayed stronger blood oxygenation level-dependent response during encoding in the left parahippocampal gyrus. No differences were obvious for the groups separated according to duration of use or an earlier and later onset of use. Linear regression analysis confirmed the association between a higher frequency of use and increased activity in the left parahippocampal gyrus.	Our findings suggest that the frequency of use might have a particular critical impact on intact parahippocampal functioning in cannabis users. Increased activity within the encoding-related network might reflect functional compensation to maintain cognitive functioning.",,Remaining,0,0
479,33951249,Journal of intellectual disability research : JIDR,Hyperactive behaviour in Angelman syndrome: the association with sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset.,"Sleep problems are common in many neurodevelopmental disorders, but little is known about how sleep is related to behavioural symptoms in Angelman syndrome (AS) or other genetic disorders. Hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and epilepsy seem to be more common in AS than in other genetic conditions associated with severe intellectual disability. We hypothesised that both more sleep problems and earlier onset of epileptic seizures would predict more symptoms of hyperactivity. Hence, the aim of the project was to explore the association between hyperactive behaviour, sleep problems and age of epilepsy onset in individuals with AS.	All known parents/guardians (n = 115) of individuals with AS in Norway were invited to participate in this descriptive correlational study. Fifty-six individuals (49%) responded, and 42 people (25 male and 17 female; mean age 18.5 years, range 2-57 years) with genetically verified AS were included. Scores for 'hyperactivity' and 'sleep problems' were derived from questionnaire data. Information on epilepsy was obtained from medical records.	'Hyperactivity' was positively correlated with 'total sleep problems' (r = 0.46, P = 0.002) and negatively correlated with 'age of epilepsy onset' (r = -0.47, P = 0.01). 'Age of epilepsy onset' was not correlated with 'total sleep problems'. An overall multiple regression model with 'hyperactivity' as the dependent variable and 'age of epilepsy onset' and 'total sleep problems' as covariates was significant (R[2]  = 0.39, F = 8.16, P = 0.002). Hence, hyperactivity in AS could be predicted from both age of epilepsy onset and current sleep problems.	Sleep problems may increase hyperactivity symptoms in individuals with AS. The association between hyperactivity and sleep problems in AS indicates that both should be investigated together as part of routine clinical assessment and intervention for either area of difficulty. Younger age of epilepsy onset was associated with more hyperactivity in AS, which may be related to encephalopathic effects of seizures and epilepsy.",Angelman syndrome| epilepsy| epileptic encephalopathy| hyperactive behaviour| sleep problems,Remaining,0,0
480,23266819,Gene,A 5-methylcytosine hotspot responsible for the prevalent HSD17B10 mutation.,"Approximately half of the cases of hydroxysteroid (17β) dehydrogenase X (HSD10) deficiency are due to a missense C>T mutation in exon 4 of the HSD17B10 gene. The resulting HSD10 (p.R130C) loses most or all catalytic functions, and the males with this mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying p.V65A, p.L122V, or p.E249Q mutations. We found that the mutated cytosine which is +2259 nucleotide from the ATG of the gene, is >90% methylated in both the active and inactive X chromosomes in two normal females as well as in the X chromosome of a normal male. Since 5-methylcytosine is prone to conversion to thymine by deamination, the methylation of this cytosine in normal X chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of the p.R130C mutation among patients with HSD10 deficiency. The substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds and reduces the van der Waals interaction between HSD10 subunits. The resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the catalytic and non-enzymatic functions of HSD10. A meta-analysis of residual HSD10 activity in eight patients with the p.R130C mutation showed an average 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase (MHBD) activity of only 6 (±5) % of the normal control level. This is significantly lower than in cells of patients with other, clinically milder mutations and suggests that the loss of HSD10/MHBD activity is a marker for the disorder.",,Remaining,0,0

A new enzyme immunoassay test (Pharmacia Meningitis EIA-Test) was evaluated as a potential rapid diagnostic method for the detection of Haemophilus influenzae (HI) type b, Neisseria meningitidis (MC) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (PNC). The test was found to have good sensitivity (0.86) and specificity (0.95) in the inter-epidemic period; and to be adaptable to the field work in The Sudan during the 1988 MC epidemic. During inter-epidemic (endemic) situations in The Sudan, greater than 90% of childhood ABM was caused by one of the three organisms, HI type b, MC and PNC. HI accounted for 57% of the cases. The peak incidence (76%) of HI cases was in infants (less than 12 months) similar to the situation in other African countries. The overall case fatality ratio was 18.6%. Prospective follow-up of survivors for 3-4 years revealed that an additional 43% either died or had permanent neurological complications, the most prevalent and persistent of which was sensorineural hearing loss recorded in 22% of long term survivors. Post-meningitic children were found to have significantly lower intelligence quotients (92.3 +/- 13.9) than their sibling controls (100.7 +/- 10.2, P = 0.029). Features of the large serogroup A sulphonamide resistant MC epidemic (February-August 1988) in Khartoum are described. An estimated annual incidence of 1,679/100,000 was recorded at the peak of the epidemic. The highest attack rate was in young children less than 5 years, as in many other African countries; nevertheless, a high morbidity was observed in adults (31% of the cases greater than or equal to 20 years). The clinical features, mortality (6.3%) and short term sequelae in Sudanese children were generally within the framework described for MC disease elsewhere. Detailed analysis of MC isolates from Sudan and Sweden by characterizing their electrophoretic enzyme types, DNA restriction endonuclease pattern and outer membrane proteins, revealed that serogroup A MC clone III-1 was responsible of The Sudan epidemic in 1988 and has been the dominant serogroup A organism in Sweden since 1973.

The sample included 13,241 working people, 18-29, 30-39, and 40-59-years-old, randomly selected in France and interviewed by phone. Occupation, type of employment, physical demands, psychological demands, job dissatisfaction, gender, age, educational level, and income were considered. Data were analyzed with logistic models.	Alcohol abuse affected 20.4% of men and 7.5% of women; smoking 32.1% and 24.2%, respectively. Their patterns of association with the occupational factors varied with gender and age. Job dissatisfaction was the leading factor among young men (adjusted odds ratio for alcohol abuse and smoking: 1.71 and 2.02), whereas short-term employment was the leading factor among young women (1.69 and 1.58), this pattern being reversed in older generations. The pattern of associations of physical and psychological demands with outcomes is more complex, but overall psychological demands were more important for women (especially the younger ones) than men, especially for smoking (OR>1.6). Smoking within 5 min after waking was much more common among male and female smokers with these occupational factors, suggesting a potential dependency.	Workers with short-term employment and occupational demands are subject to a higher risk for alcohol abuse and smoking with high gender and age disparities. Gender and age should be considered when designing measures to prevent substance abuse related to occupation.",,Remaining,0,0

Participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment, related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a work-related or non-work related accident. All patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation. All patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits, the Computerized Assessment of Response Bias (CARB) and the Word Memory Test (WMT) as part of their evaluation. The diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases, varying from very minor to very severe. Normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the CARB and the WMT. Patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 10-12 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries. In a subgroup of patients who failed either the CARB or the WMT, there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test. Therefore, the dose-response relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses. Those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the CARB and the WMT were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the non-head-injured orthopedic control subjects. Therefore, anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from self-reports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed. Effort should also be controlled in group studies of olfaction.",,Remaining,0,0

Females with T2DM, but not males, had increased depression compared to T1DM. Females had increased depression compared to males in T1DM (p = 0.046) and a near significant increase in T2DM (p = 0.069). In T1DM, but not T2DM, HbA1c levels were increased in high and moderate, compared to low, risk depression risk groups (p = 0.007). Follow-up HbA1c was unchanged 1 year later and there were no differences between those involved in counseling and those who refused to attend. Sex and type of diabetes had no effect on response to counseling.	These results demonstrate increased depression in adolescents with T2DM compared to T1DM and in females compared to controls.

The gene responsible for MEN 1 syndrome was recently identified and cloned. Low rates of MEN 1 gene mutations and deletions have been reported in sporadic pituitary adenomas. To elucidate the role of the MEN 1 gene in the pathogenesis of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors, we examined pituitary adenomas from 11 MEN 1 patients for the presence of 11q13 allelic loss. Ten of the 11 pituitary tumors were informative by PCR-based loss of heterozygosity analysis. Using a combination of family pedigree analysis and restriction analysis directed at the mutated allele in 8 of the 10 informative cases, it was demonstrated in all 8 cases that it is the wild-type allele that undergoes deletion. All 11 tumors, 4 of which were growth hormone secreting, were additionally analyzed for mutation in the Gs alpha subunit (gsp) gene. None of the tumors (0 of 11 tumors) revealed a gsp gene mutation. Therefore, genetic alterations of the MEN 1 gene seem to play a dominant role in MEN 1-associated pituitary tumorigenesis, whereas gsp gene mutations do not seem to be a frequent event in either growth hormone-secreting or other types of MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors. These results suggest that MEN 1-associated pituitary tumors develop via genetic pathways that differ from those of most sporadic pituitary tumors.",,Remaining,0,0

However, the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the DMN abnormalities remains unclear in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients. Forty-six unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls were recruited for a resting-state scan. The images were analyzed using the functional connectivity (FC) method.

Lifetime sexually transmitted disease risk behavior was categorized as none, only one, and multiple sexual experiences with prostitutes, whereas risk according to partner mix was classified as no sexual experience with prostitutes, sexual experience with prostitutes only, and with both prostitutes and girlfriends. The proportional odds model was applied to the data.	A total of 25.8% of the university students had visited prostitutes--17.6% visited twice or more, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes (odds ratio = 1.71) and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends (odds ratio = 2.30).	In this first systematic study of the association between alcohol consumption and sexual experiences among Korean male university students, alcohol use was associated with risky sexual behaviors, and with first and most recent sexual experience with prostitutes, supporting our hypotheses.	In Asia, where men frequently have sex with prostitutes, there is a direct and statistically significant dose-response relationship between frequency of sex with prostitutes and HIV-1 seroprevalence. Young Korean men are reported to routinely have sex with prostitutes. Findings are reported from an examination of alcohol consumption and sexually transmitted disease (STD) risk behavior as related to prostitute visits and sex partner mix among 1095 representative male Korean university students aged 17-32 years, of mean age 22.1 years, during 1993-94. The men were drawn from 4 universities in Seoul. 25.8% of surveyed university students had visited prostitutes, 17.6% at least 2 times, and 12.9% had sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends. Heavier alcohol consumption was significantly related to multiple visits to prostitutes and to sexual experiences with both prostitutes and girlfriends.","Age Factors| Alcohol Drinking| Asia| Behavior| Biology| Demographic Factors| Developing Countries| Diseases| Eastern Asia| Education| Infections| Korea| Korea, Republic Of| Men| Population| Population Characteristics| Prostitutes| Reproductive Tract Infections| Research Report| Risk Behavior| Risk Factors| Schools| Sex Behavior--men| Sexual Partners| Sexually Transmitted Diseases| Students--men| Universities| Urban Population| Youth--men",Remaining,0,0

We targeted provoked confabulation, false recall and false recognition in the Deese-Roediger-McDermott-paradigm (DRM-paradigm) as well as false recognition in a mirror reading task. ACoA patients produced more provoked confabulations and more false recognition in mirror reading than comparison subjects. Conversely, false recall/false recognition in the DRM-paradigm were similar in patients and controls. Whereas the former two indices of false memories were correlated, no relationship was revealed with the DRM-paradigm. Our results suggest that rupture of ACoA aneurysm leads to an increased susceptibility to a subset of false memories types.",,Remaining,0,0

VRK2 is considered to be related to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. In this study, we analyzed the correlation between VRK2, rs4380187 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and schizophrenia.	Peripheral blood DNA was extracted using a genomic DNA extraction kit. The DNA samples were genotyped using the Agena MassARRAY platform, and four genetic models were applied to compute the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using unconditional logistic regression. The p value was obtained by the chi-square and t test for independent samples.	The C allele of rs4380187 SNP was significantly (p = 0.008) associated with decreased risk of SZ. The AA genotype of rs4380187 showed significantly (p = 0.009) lower frequency in cases with SZ than in controls and was associated with decreased risk of the disease. The frequency of the CA genotype of rs4380187 correlated with a 0.73-fold decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.033). In the co-dominant genetic model, the genotype of rs4380187 was associated with a decreased risk of SZ (p = 0.010). We also found that the log-additive model of rs4380187 significantly reduced the risk of SZ disease (p = 0.007).	This study provides further evidence that rs4380187 SNP is associated with SZ. This genotype variation could be associated with the psychopathology and cognitive function in SZ.",VRK2| case-control study| schizophrenia| single-nucleotide polymorphism,Remaining,0,0

Adult,An ecologically sensitive measure of executive cognition (the Breakfast Task) improves prediction of functional outcome in schizophrenia.,"Previous work has found that the Breakfast Task (BT), a computerized, ecologically informed executive ability measure, is sensitive to group differences in aging, acquired brain injury, and Parkinson's disease. We investigated whether this measure improves the prediction of functional status over and above standard measures of general intellectual ability, relationship perception, life skills, and symptom severity in individuals with schizophrenia. Regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the joint and incremental validity of the BT in predicting functional disability scores on the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Scale (WHODAS 2.0). Analyses with combined patient (n = 25) and control (n = 32) participants showed that participant status (patients versus control) was the only significant predictor of functional outcome. However, in the patient data, the proportion of variance accounted for improved significantly (model R[2] of 4% vs. 25%) when BT scores were added to a model containing clinical (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), social (Relationships Across Domains), intellectual (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence), and life skills (Canadian Objective Assessment of Life Skills) measures.

One male patient died of suicide (1.1%) and 18 (19.6%) individuals repeated parasuicide using self-poisoning. The rate of repeated parasuicidal behaviour in this investigation was considerably higher than that reported in comparable studies from developing countries but similar to that from a number of western European cities. The data indicated that the probability of further episodes of parasuicidal behaviour increased in the few months after the index episode. Although the repeaters and non-repeaters were essentially similar in most of their sociodemographic characteristics, the former were a distinctive group in many respects. The factors found to be significantly associated with subsequent parasuicide included self-poisoning by prescribed drugs at the index parasuicide, previous parasuicidal behaviour prior to the index, occupational status of a housewife, past history of depression and/or dependence and precipitating life events in the family environment. Contrary to our hypothesized theory, none of the types of attitudes received by the patients from their family members at the index parasuicide related to outcome. The global level of social readjustment of non-repeaters was about three times higher than that of repeaters of parasuicide. The implications of these findings for future policy making were discussed with respect to prevention of parasuicide.",,Remaining,0,0

A cross-sectional study of IDU recruited from the streets by ex-IDU interviewers. A standardized and anonymous questionnaire which explored behaviors in the previous 6 months was used. Saliva samples were collected to determine human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence. Logistic regression models were used to identify determinants of accepting and passing on used syringes.	Of the 300 participants, 17.7% and 13.3% accepted and passed on used syringes, respectively. 74.8% practiced front-backloading (to prepare the drug solution in a syringe and then divide it up into other syringes) and 77.9% shared other equipment. The prevalence of HIV was 57.7%. The predictors of accepting used syringes were using more than 4 drugs (odds ratio [OR] = 5.6), having a positive hepatitis C virus status (OR = 7.3), practising front/backloading (OR = 12.6) and having an IDU steady partner (OR = 2.9); and with passing on used syringes were practicing front/backloading (OR = 4.9), having an IDU steady partner (OR = 5.8), and having sexual risk behaviors with casual partners (OR = 4.0). Starting to inject drugs older than 15 years of age was a protective factor (OR = 0.2).

We sought to implement this into clinical practice.	Paediatric ED triage staff underwent competency-based assessments for HIDAT with all head injury presentations 1 May to 31 October 2020 included in analysis. We determined which patients were discharged using the tool, which underwent CT of the brain and whether there was a clinically important traumatic brain injury or representation to the ED.	Of the 1429 patients screened; 610 (43%) screened negative with 250 (18%) discharged by nursing staff. Of the entire cohort, 32 CTs were performed for head injury concerns (6 abnormal) with 1 CT performed in the HIDAT negative group (normal). Of those discharged using HIDAT, four reattended, two with vomiting (no imaging or admission) and two with minor scalp wound infections. Two patients who screened negative declined discharge under the policy with later medical discharge (no imaging or admission). Paediatric ED attendances were 29% lower than in 2018.	We have successfully implemented HIDAT into local clinical practice. The number discharged (18%) is lower than originally described; this is likely multifactorial. The relationship between COVID-19 and paediatric ED attendances is unclear but decreased attendances suggest those for whom the tool was originally designed are not attending ED and may be accessing other medical/non-medical resources.",emergency care systems| head| paediatric emergency med| paediatric injury| performance improvement| trauma,Remaining,0,0

Data concerning 24 indicators, drawn from NICE recommendations, were collected in 19 Departments of Mental Health, in the frame of the SIEP-DIRECT'S Project to evaluate the implementation of NICE recommendations in Italian Mental Health Services.	The treatment of the acute episode in the Italian Mental Health Services is not based only on admissions in Psychiatric Ward in General Hospitals, but also on intensive home based care. The utilization of day hospital facilities for treating acute episodes is less frequent, as the presence of home based follow up after discharge. About 3/4 of Departments of Mental Health did not have clinical guidelines concerning the pharmacological treatment in this area. However usually the standard practices followed NICE recommendations in terms of prescribed dosages, monitoring side effects and rationale for shifting to atypical antipsychotic drugs. Antipsychotic drugs, atypical or conventional, were frequently prescribed concurrently, while utilization of atypical antipsychotic drugs was increasing.	The results show critical points concerning on one hand the scarce diffusion of clinical guidelines, on other hand the connection between standard practices, clinical guidelines and marketing of atypical antipsychotic drugs. It should be reinforced the role of the community and particularly at service level the capacity of community mental health teams to treat the acute patients.",,Remaining,0,0
504,33498908,"Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",Brain Asymmetry Detection and Machine Learning Classification for Diagnosis of Early Dementia.,"Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is considered essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries.",SVM| asymmetry detection| brain MRI| brain asymmetry| deep learning| dementia| machine learning methods,Remaining,0,0

All zero-order correlations between six CBCL DSM-oriented scales (DOS) and three competence scales (CS) were negative and small-to-moderate. After implementing multiple regressions we found robust enough prediction only for ADH DOS on school CS, and for anxiety DOS on social CS. Results from the intrapair differences model indicated shared elements of liability, rather than direct causation, as more likely explanations for the negative phenotypic correlations between these emotional/behavioural problem and competencies scores. Bivariate analyses indicated shared genetic factors that influence simultaneously the emotional/behavioural problems and the competencies domains as the best explanations for the phenotypic covariations between DOS and CS.",,Remaining,0,0

Recent reports clarified that NSE exists not only in neurons but also in neuroendocrine cells, thrombocytes and lymphocytes. Besides normal neuronal tissues, high serum levels of NSE were noticed in the patients with neuroblastomas, small cell carcinomas of the lung, and malignant gliomas, etc. In order to clarify the usefulness of NSE as a marker for intracranial neoplasms or an indicator for prognosis of the patients with intra-cranial tumors, we studied serum, CSF and intratumoral fluid levels of NSE in 62 patients with intra-cranial tumors by radioimmunoassay. Serum level of NSE in healthy adults ranged from 4.1 to 8.9 ng/ml (5.6 +/- 1.38 ng/ml, n = 15) and that of CSF ranged from 4.9 to 7.3 ng/ml (means 6.1 ng/ml, n = 3). Serum samples from patients with malignant gliomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumors contained abnormally high level of NSE, of which mean value were 22.3 ng/ml and 16.1 ng/ml, respectively. However, serum samples from patients with low grade gliomas and other intracranial tumors arising from non-neuroectodermal tissues were within normal range. In 9 patients, not only serum levels but CSF levels and/or intratumoral cyst levels of NSE were examined at the same time.

However, studies on cholesterol measured in late-life and cognitive function have been inconsistent. Few studies have explored nonlinear relationships or considered interactions with other biomarker measures.	A cross-sectional sample of 1,889 participants from four rural counties in the People's Republic of China was included in this analysis. Serum total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, and homocysteine levels were measured in fasting blood samples. A composite cognitive score was derived based on nine standardized cognitive test scores. Analysis of covariance models were used to investigate the association between biomarker measures and the composite cognitive scores.	There was a significant interaction between the homocysteine quartile group and the cholesterol quartile group on cognitive scores (P=0.0478). In participants with normal homocysteine levels, an inverse U-shaped relationship between total cholesterol level and cognitive score was found, indicating that both low and high cholesterol levels were associated with lower cognitive scores. In participants with high homocysteine levels, no significant association between cholesterol and cognition was found.	The relationship between cholesterol levels and cognitive function depends upon homocysteine levels, suggesting an interactive role between cholesterol and homocysteine on cognitive function in the elderly population. Additional research is required to confirm our findings in other populations, and to explore potential mechanisms underlying the lipid-homocysteine interaction.",cholesterol| cognitive function| homocysteine,Remaining,0,0

Clinical examination showed the following abnormalities; excessive square wave jerks--21 of 30 patients; mild vertical supranuclear gaze palsy--8 of 30; gaze-evoked nystagmus--12 of 30 patients, three of whom had no extraocular evidence of cerebellar dysfunction; positioning downbeat nystagmus--10 of 25; mild or moderate saccadic hypometria--22 of 30; impaired ('broken up') smooth pursuit--28 of 30; reduced VOR suppression--16 of 24. Electro-oculography and caloric testing did not add significant extra information. In patients presenting with an akinetic-rigid syndrome it can be difficult to differentiate idiopathic Parkinson's disease from MSA-P and other causes of atypical parkinsonism. Our findings suggest that the presence of excessive square wave jerks, mild-moderate hypometria of saccades, impaired VOR suppression, spontaneous nystagmus or positioning downbeat nystagmus may be oculomotor 'red flags' or clues to the presence of MSA.

Its clinical use has expanded to control of seizures, by pre-hospital emergency medical services (EMS), and is finding new purpose as an analgesic alternative and antidepressant. Ketamine brings hope for effective management of chronic pain in the absence of opioids and decreasing suicidal ideations; however, its persistence as a recreational drug for its hallucinogenic properties remains. In the wake of expanding medicinal purposes, the diversity of New York City's population was explored to better understand its misuse. This retrospective study looks at the prevalence of ketamine in driver fatalities over a period of 18 years (2003-2020) and cases involving suspected driving under the influence of drugs (DUID) over a period of 6 years (2015-2020). Ketamine was identified in 6 driver fatalities and in 47 DUID cases. None of the driver fatalities were suspected of ketamine misuse, due to administration either in hospital or by EMS. In the DUID cases, an increasing trend was observed over the 6-year study period with 100% (n = 47) of the cases confirmed as non-hospital/non-EMS administered ketamine. Of the DUID cases, 94% were male with the majority between the age of 21 and 39 years (85%) and were predominantly Hispanic (36%) and Asian (34%). Blood concentrations of ketamine ranged from 27 to >2000 ng/mL with polydrug use prevalent. The most common drug classes detected in addition to ketamine were cannabinoids (38%), ethanol (32%), benzodiazepines (26%), cocaine (19%) and amphetamines/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (15%). In 2019, 2-fluoro-deschloroketamine was identified in two cases for the first time. Despite its increased acceptance for mental health disorders, ketamine's persistence and misuse as a recreational drug remains and should continue to be monitored by relevant toxicological, clinical and law enforcement communities along with emerging illicit ketamine analogs.",,Remaining,0,0

We report here a simple and rapid strategy to detect the precise number of the CAGs. After the DNA fragment containing the CAG repeats is amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, a primer extension is carried out; the extension of the end-labelled reverse primer adjacent to 3' end of CAG repeats stops at the first T after CAG repeats with the incorporation of dideoxy ATP in the reaction mixture. The resultant primer products are analysed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography.

519,20346443,Biological psychiatry,Characterization of a family with rare deletions in CNTNAP5 and DOCK4 suggests novel risk loci for autism and dyslexia.,"Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are characterized by social, communication, and behavioral deficits and complex genetic etiology. A recent study of 517 ASD families implicated DOCK4 by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) association and a microdeletion in an affected sibling pair.	The DOCK4 microdeletion on 7q31.1 was further characterized in this family using QuantiSNP analysis of 1M SNP array data and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Extended family members were tested by polymerase chain reaction amplification of junction fragments. DOCK4 dosage was measured in additional samples using SNP arrays. Since QuantiSNP analysis identified a novel CNTNAP5 microdeletion in the same affected sibling pair, this gene was sequenced in 143 additional ASD families. Further polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis included 380 ASD cases and suitable control subjects.	The maternally inherited microdeletion encompassed chr7:110,663,978-111,257,682 and led to a DOCK4-IMMP2L fusion transcript. It was also detected in five extended family members with no ASD. However, six of nine individuals with this microdeletion had poor reading ability, which prompted us to screen 606 other dyslexia cases. This led to the identification of a second DOCK4 microdeletion co-segregating with dyslexia. Assessment of genomic background in the original ASD family detected a paternal 2q14.3 microdeletion disrupting CNTNAP5 that was also transmitted to both affected siblings. Analysis of other ASD cohorts revealed four additional rare missense changes in CNTNAP5. No exonic deletions of DOCK4 or CNTNAP5 were seen in 2091 control subjects.	This study highlights two new risk factors for ASD and dyslexia and demonstrates the importance of performing a high-resolution assessment of genomic background, even after detection of a rare and likely damaging microdeletion using a targeted approach.",,Remaining,0,0

SERT LI was highest in amygdala and subiculum regions. In the surgical series, higher SERT LI was observed in high risk than low risk cases in the dentate gyrus, CA1 and subiculum (p < 0.05). In the post-mortem cases higher SERT LI and AL was observed in the basal and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala and peri-amygdala cortex in SUDEP compared to epilepsy controls (p < 0.05). Patients on SRI showed higher SERT in the dentate gyrus (p < 0.005) and CA4 (p < 0.05) but there was no difference in patients with or without a psychiatric history. Higher SERT in hippocampal subfields in TLE/HS cases with SUDEP risk factors and higher amygdala SERT in post-mortem SUDEP cases than epilepsy controls supports a role for altered serotonergic networks involving limbic regions in SUDEP. This may be of functional relevance through reduced 5-HT availability.",SRI| SUDEP| amygdala| hippocampus| serotonin transporter,Remaining,0,0
521,19194374,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,A polymorphism of the MAOA gene is associated with emotional brain markers and personality traits on an antisocial index.,"Association studies suggest that the low activity variant of the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)-uVNTR polymorphism confers risk for emotional disturbances associated with antisocial traits, particularly in males. Here, we assessed the low (MAOA-L) activity variant in relation to both brain function and a behavioral index of antisocial traits. From an initial sample of 290 healthy participants, 210 had low (MAOA-L) or high (MAOA-H) activity variants. Participants underwent a brief assessment of personality traits and event-related potential (ERP) recording during an emotion-processing task. Genotype differences in ERPs were localized using LORETA. The MAOA-L genotype was distinguished by elevated scores on the index of antisocial traits. These traits were related to altered ERPs elicited 120-280ms post-stimulus, particularly for negative emotion. Altered neural processing of anger in MAOA-L genotypes was localized to medial frontal, parietal, and superior temporo-occipital regions in males, but only to the superior occipital cortex in females. The MAOA low activity variant may increase susceptibility to antisocial traits through alterations to the neural systems for processing threat-related emotion, especially for males. Monoamines such as noradrenalin and serotonin may modulate these relationships, given that their metabolism varies according to MAOA variants, and that they modulate both emotional brain systems and antisocial aggression.",,Remaining,0,0
522,32279420,Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,HOTAIR/miR-125 axis-mediated Hexokinase 2 expression promotes chemoresistance in human glioblastoma.,"Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles in glioblastoma (GBM) treatments using temozolomide (TMZ) based conventional chemotherapy. Recent studies revealed that Hexokinase 2 (HK2)-mediated glycolysis is one of the sources, as the association of chemoresistance and the expression of HK2 was confirmed in multiple cancers. However, there has been little knowledge of the functional contribution of HK2 to TMZ resistance in GBM. In our study, we found that HK2 expression is crucial for GBM proliferation and chemoresistance. In contrast to the healthy brain, HK2 expression is much higher in human GBM, especially in those patients with GBM recurrence. High HK2 expression is negatively related to the overall survival in GBM patients. HK2 depletion in GBM cells suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to TMZ-induced apoptosis. Both HK2-mediated glycolysis and mitochondria permeability transition pore opening (MPTP) were associated with its function in chemoresistance. Furthermore, we also revealed that the abnormal expression of HK2 was modulated by the expression of HOTAIR, a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA). The absence of HOTAIR in GBM cells suppressed the HK2 expression in protein and mRNA level and, therefore, inhibited the cell proliferation and enhanced the cytotoxicity of TMZ both in vivo and in vitro. HOTAIR promoted the expression of HK2 by targeting mir-125, which suppressed the GBM cell proliferation and increased the TMZ-induced apoptosis. These findings shed light on a new therapeutic strategy in modulating HOTAIR/miR-125, which may interfere with the expression of HK2, and enhance the therapeutic sensitivity of GBM to TMZ.",Hexokinase 2| chemoresistance| glioblastoma| miR-125,Remaining,0,0

An eight year follow-up study.,"The objective of this study was to report changes in characteristics of admissions to an established Psychiatric Emergency Care Centre (PECC) eight years after its opening.	Key clinical characteristics of admissions to the PECC were documented for 327 patients in 2015 and compared with the 477 patients in 2007, which is when the centre first opened. The characteristics of admission were evaluated using an audit of medical records from June to December in both 2007 and 2015.	Statistically significant differences (p<0.05) between 2007 and 2015 were: a reduction in the numbers of patients admitted with depression; a reduction in the numbers of patients diagnosed with adjustment disorder; an increase in the numbers of patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder; a reduction in pro re nata (prn) use, including a reduction in the need for chemical restraint with midazolam and a decrease in the length of admission in the PECC.	The significant reduction in aggression, the use of prn medication and the number of people with longer stays within the PECC support the usefulness of PECCs in relation to patient satisfaction and adherence to admission criteria policy.

Isotonitazene powder and purity determination was performed on the sample collected in the first death scene by NMR, HRMS, GC-FTIR, ATR-FTIR and GC-MS. Isotonitazene purity was determined by GC-MS analysis and proton NMR, and was defined to be above 95 % and 98 %, respectively. Quantification of isotonitazene in biological samples was performed using a targeted analysis based on SPE extraction and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. The isotonitazene median concentration in femoral whole blood was 1.20ng/mL. Isotonitazene concentration in hair was similar or even lower compared to that seen in fentanyl abusers. Isotonitazene distribution in tissues converges in the brain, lungs and heart, respectively. Surprisingly, isotonitazene concentration in liver is the lowest measured for all tissues and fluids analyzed. Based on circumstantial evidence, autopsy findings and the results of the toxicological analysis, the medical examiner concluded that the cause of all three deaths was an acute intoxication with isotonitazene.

In many cases paediatricians are the first point of contact. In order to increase recognition rates, screening instruments may be a helpful support for health care professionals. However, there is a lack of valid and economical screening instruments for primary care patients. Thus, the aim of the study was the development of the new Depression Screener for Teenagers (DesTeen) and its validation in a paediatric sample.	326 patients between 13 and 16 years old completed the DesTeen and a diagnostic interview, serving as gold standard. Prevalence rate for any depressive disorder (minor depression, major depression and dysthymia) was 12.6%. Psychometric properties were calculated. For validity measures, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for any depressive disorder and the diagnostic subgroups was computed.	DesTeen showed a high reliability (Cronbach's α=.87) and a high validity (AUC=.91). For the diagnostic subgroups AUC values did not significantly differ from overall accuracy of any depressive disorder (major depression: AUC=.95, p=.179; dysthymia: AUC=.88, p=.605; minor depression: AUC=.87, p=.327). The optimal cut-off point for any depressive disorder according to the Youden-Index yielded a sensitivity of .90 and a specificity of .80. An abbreviated 5-item version of DesTeen showed no loss in validity (AUC=.90, p=.695).	Overall, DesTeen can be regarded as a valid screening instrument for adolescent paediatric patients. For practical use, the 5-item version is even more promising. A replication of these results is essential.",,Remaining,0,0

We measured cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels in 17 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 7 patients with frontotemporal dementia in comparison with 17 patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and 15 patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia had significantly higher cerebrospinal fluid interleukin-15 levels compared with patients with noninflammatory neurological diseases (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively).

In 2005, 47 laboratory-confirmed and probable clinical cases of SLEV infection were reported in Córdoba, Argentina. Although the causes of 2005 outbreak remain unknown, they might be related not only to virological factors, but also to ecological and environmental conditions. We hypothesized that one of the factors for SLE reemergence in Córdoba, Argentina, was the introduction of a new SLEV genotype (SLEV genotype III), with no previous activity in the area. In order to evaluate this hypothesis we carried out a molecular characterization of SLEV detections from mosquitoes collected between 2001 and 2004 in Córdoba city. A total of 315 mosquito pools (11,002 individuals) including 12 mosquitoes species were analyzed. Overall, 20 pools (8 mosquitoes species) were positive for SLEV. During this study, genotypes II, V and VII were detected. No mosquito pool infected with genotype III was detected before the 2005 outbreak. Genotype V was found every year and in the 8 sampled sites. Genotypes II and VII showed limited temporal and spatial activities. We cannot dismiss the association of genotype II and V as etiological agents during the outbreak. However, the silent circulation of other SLEV strains in Córdoba city before the 2005 outbreak suggests that the introduction of genotype III was an important factor associated to this event. Not mutually exclusive, other factors such as changes in avian hosts and mosquitoes vectors communities, driven by climatic and environmental modifications, should also be taken into consideration in further studies.",,Remaining,0,0

Yet there is an under-representation of the older population in the BP literature. We present extensive interview data from the Longitudinal Study of Aging Danish Twins, dealing with a population-based sample of Danish twins aged 70-102, and describing the 1-month prevalence of BP and the development of BP over time. The associations between BP and education, self-rated health, other health problems, lifestyle factors, and physical and mental function were also investigated. Data were analysed in a cross-sectional analysis for all answers given at entry into the study and in a longitudinal analysis for participants in all four surveys. Associated factors were analysed for the cross-sectional sample using univariate and multivariate analysis accounting for the non-independence of twins in complete pairs. The overall 1-month prevalence of BP was 25% and differed significantly between men and women. The variations in prevalence between the age groups and over time were negligible. The majority of participants in all four surveys had either not experienced BP during the previous month or had done so on one occasion only. Education was not associated with BP. Self-rated health was associated with BP in a significant 'dose-response' like pattern. BP was associated with bone and joint disorders, migraine headaches, lung disease, cardiovascular disorders and gastric ulcer, but not neurologic or endocrinologic diseases. BP sufferers had significantly lower scores on physical but not on mental functioning. We conclude that BP is a common symptom in old age; however, the prevalence does not change with increasing age.

While the relationship between psychosis and clinical variables has been examined frequently, few studies have examined the relationship between psychosis and the 2 major neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer disease: neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. We characterized the occurrence of psychosis in relation to dementia severity and determined if subjects with Alzheimer disease and psychosis had a greater neurofibrillary tangle or senile plaque burden than subjects with Alzheimer disease and no psychosis.	One hundred nine subjects with Alzheimer disease were followed longitudinally with semistructured assessments in order to assign a Clinical Dementia Rating and determine whether psychosis was present. After the subjects died, their brains were obtained for histological examination. Analysis of variance was used to compare the densities of neurofibrillary tangles, total senile plaques, and cored senile plaques in subjects with psychosis vs subjects without psychosis, in several neocortical regions, the hippocampus, and the entorhinal cortex.	Psychosis occurred commonly in Alzheimer disease, affecting 63% of subjects. The frequency of psychosis increased with increasing dementia severity. More importantly, we found that subjects with psychosis had a 2.3-fold (95% confidence interval, 1.2-3.9) greater density of neocortical neurofibrillary tangles than did subjects without psychosis. The increase was independent of dementia severity. No similar relationship with psychosis was seen for total senile plaques or cored senile plaques.	The increase in psychosis frequency that occurs with the progression of dementia severity and the independent association between psychosis and neurofibrillary tangle density suggest the possibility that some common underlying process or processes specific to Alzheimer disease may regulate both phenomena.

Data was from the Japanese Schizophrenia Sib-pair Linkage Group (JSSLG), which is a multi-site collaborative study group established to create a national resource for genetic studies of schizophrenia in Japan. All subjects were Japanese, and the probands and their siblings had schizophrenia. Multipoint non-parametric linkage analysis and exclusion mapping were performed with GENEHUNTER software. Simulation studies suggested that in the absence of linkage we could expect one multipoint maximum LOD score (MLS) of 1.9 per genome scan. An MLS of 3.7 would be expected only once in every 20 genome scans and thus corresponds to a genome-wide significance of 0.05. No loci in the initial screen fulfilled the criteria for significant or suggestive evidence for linkage. Ten chromosomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 20) had at least one region with a nominal P value < 0.05.

The following oculomotor paradigms were investigated: horizontal and vertical saccades of different sizes (10-80 degrees), smooth pursuit eye movements, optokinetic and vestibular nystagmus. It was found that 75% of the HD patients had pathologically slow saccades. This number rose to 87% if other oculomotor deficits were included. Thus a small, but definite number of HD patients had normal eye movements. This included patients with disease durations of more than 14 years. A comparison with the results of clinical and evoked potential studies on these patients showed that they were clinically only mildly affected but did not form a different group of HD patients. Subjects at risk had statistically (P less than 0.01) slower horizontal saccades (average 427 deg/sec) than the controls (455 deg/sec). For 11% of the subjects at risk horizontal saccade velocity was pathological and altogether 22% had some oculomotor deficits. Subjects with pathological slow horizontal saccades also had a high incidence (64%) of pathological evoked potentials.

During the further follow-up period, head circumference SDS remained at approximately -0.3 in boys and 0.0 in girls. While the mean verbal and performance IQ of the total study population at 5 and 6 years of age did not differ from a group of 212 healthy non-PKU children, patients with a head circumference SDS less than the population median at 2 years of age exhibited poorer cognitive abilities at school age than those patients with a relative head size greater than the population median. The children with a head circumference less than the median at 2 years had smaller head sizes already at birth; in addition, the change in relative head size during the first 2 years was correlated significantly with cognitive abilities at school age in boys. Mean bone age was identical to chronological age at each time point of observation. The rate of maturation was one year of bone age per year of chronological age. No correlation between phenylalanine intake or phenylalanine concentrations and the rates of body or head growth or skeletal maturation could be established. We conclude that despite adequate weight gain, moderate growth retardation occurred during the first 2 years of life in this group of children treated for PKU. Growth was more compromised in boys than in girls and tended to be compensated during later follow-up. Early infantile head circumference and growth appear to be predictors of cognitive development.",,Remaining,0,0

The high frequency of obsessive-compulsive symptoms reported in subjects with the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (DiGeorge/velocardiofacial syndrome) or Prader-Willi syndrome (15q11-13 deletion of the paternally derived chromosome), suggests that gene dosage effects in these chromosomal regions could increase risk for OCD. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search for microrearrangements in these two regions in OCD patients.	We screened the 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 chromosomal regions for genomic imbalances in 236 patients with OCD using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA).	No deletions or duplications involving 15q11-13 or 22q11.2 were identified in our patients.	Our results suggest that deletions/duplications of chromosomes 15q11-13 and 22q11.2 are rare in OCD. Despite the negative findings in these two regions, the search for copy number variants in OCD using genome-wide array-based methods is a highly promising approach to identify genes of etiologic importance in the development of OCD.",,Remaining,0,0
546,26474818,"Prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and essential fatty acids",Genetic variation in FADS genes is associated with maternal long-chain PUFA status but not with cognitive development of infants in a high fish-eating observational study.,"Long-chain n-6 and n-3 PUFA (LC-PUFA), arachidonic acid (AA) (20:4n-6) and DHA (22:6n-3), are critical for optimal brain development. These fatty acids can be consumed directly from the diet, or synthesized endogenously from precursor PUFA by Δ-5 (encoded by FADS1) and Δ-6 desaturases (encoded by FADS2). The aim of this study was to determine the potential importance of maternal genetic variability in FADS1 and FADS2 genes to maternal LC-PUFA status and infant neurodevelopment in populations with high fish intakes. The Nutrition Cohorts 1 (NC1) and 2 (NC2) are longitudinal observational mother-child cohorts in the Republic of Seychelles. Maternal serum LC-PUFA was measured at 28 weeks gestation and genotyping for rs174537 (FADS1), rs174561 (FADS1), rs3834458 (FADS1-FADS2) and rs174575 (FADS2) was performed in both cohorts. The children completed the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II (BSID-II) at 30 months in NC1 and at 20 months in NC2. Complete data were available for 221 and 1310 mothers from NC1 and NC2 respectively. With increasing number of rs3834458 minor alleles, maternal concentrations of AA were significantly decreased (NC1 p=0.004; NC2 p<0.001) and precursor:product ratios for linoleic acid (LA) (18:2n-6)-to-AA (NC1 p<0.001; NC2 p<0.001) and α-linolenic acid (ALA) (18:3n-3)-to-DHA were increased (NC2 p=0.028). There were no significant associations between maternal FADS genotype and BSID-II scores in either cohort. A trend for improved PDI was found among infants born to mothers with the minor rs3834458 allele.In these high fish-eating cohorts, genetic variability in FADS genes was associated with maternal AA status measured in serum and a subtle association of the FADS genotype was found with neurodevelopment.",Maternal fish consumption| Neurodevelopment| Seychelles Child Development Study (SCDS)| Δ-5 Desaturase (Δ5D)| Δ-6 Desaturase (Δ6D),Remaining,0,0

Population-based study of incident dementia in spouses of persons with dementia.	Rural county in northern Utah.	Two thousand four hundred forty-two subjects (1,221 married couples) aged 65 and older.	Incident dementia was diagnosed in 255 subjects, with onset defined as age when subject met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, criteria for dementia. Cox proportional hazards regression tested the effect of time-dependent exposure to dementia in one's spouse, adjusted for potential confounders.	A subject whose spouse experienced incident dementia onset had a six times greater risk for incident dementia as subjects whose spouses were dementia free (hazard rate ratio (HRR)=6.0, 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.2-16.2, P<.001). In sex-specific analyses, husbands had higher risks (HRR=11.9, 95% CI=1.7-85.5, P=.01) than wives (HRR=3.7, 95% CI=1.2-11.6, P=.03).

The Sydney Myopia Study examined 1765 predominantly 6 year old children from 34 randomly selected Sydney schools during 2003-4. Keratometry, cycloplegic autorefraction, and questionnaire data were collected.	Spherical equivalent (SE) anisometropia (> or =1 dioptre) prevalence was 1.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.1% to 2.4%). Aniso-astigmatism (>or =1D) prevalence was 1.0% (CI: 0.6% to 1.6%). Both conditions were significantly more prevalent among moderately hyperopic (SE > or =2.0D) than mildly hyperopic (SE 0.5-1.9D) children. Myopic children (SE < or =-0.5D) had higher anisometropia prevalence. Neither condition varied by age, sex, or ethnicity. In multivariate analyses, anisometropia was significantly associated with amblyopia, odds ratio (OR) 29, (CI: 8.7 to 99), exotropia (OR 7.7, CI: 1.2 to 50), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (OR 3.6, CI: 1.1 to 12.6). Aniso-astigmatism was significantly associated with amblyopia (OR 8.2, CI: 1.4 to 47), maternal age >35 years (OR 4.0, CI: 1.3 to 11.9), and NICU admission (OR 4.6, CI: 1.2 to 17.2). Anisometropia resulted from relatively large interocular differences in axial length (p<0.0001) and anterior chamber depth (p = 0.0009). Aniso-astigmatism resulted from differences in corneal astigmatism (p<0.0001).	In this predominantly 6 year old population, anisometropia and aniso-astigmatism were uncommon, had important birth and biometry associations, and were strongly related to amblyopia and strabismus.",,Remaining,0,0

The Social Inclusion Questionnaire User Experience (SInQUE) is a new measure of social inclusion for mental health service users which assesses five domains (consumption, production, access to services, social integration and civil engagement). It has good psychometric properties and is acceptable to service users and mental health professionals. It is not clear whether individuals with different diagnostic conditions experience a similar reduction in social inclusion.	(1) Investigate whether current social inclusion differs between diagnostic groups (people with schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders, common mental disorder or personality disorder); (2) Identify factors associated with lower social inclusion; (3) Examine associations between social inclusion and stigma, quality of life and loneliness.	Mental health service users with psychotic disorder, personality disorder or common mental disorder, living in the community, completed the SInQUE, alongside other validated outcome measures. Multiple regression investigated associations.	About 192 service users (55% with psychotic disorder; 26% with common mental disorder; 19% with personality disorder). Current social inclusion did not vary according to diagnosis, except for the sub-domain of productivity, where individuals with personality disorder were more socially included than the other two groups. Lower social inclusion was associated with older age (p = .008), lack of higher education (p < .001), more previous admissions (p = .005), severity of current symptoms and greater experienced stigma (p = .006) and anticipated stigma (p = .035). Greater social inclusion was associated with better quality of life (p < .001) and less loneliness (p < .001).	Barriers to social inclusion in individuals with severe mental health problems include factors related to the illness, such as symptom severity and external factors, such as stigma and discrimination. Social inclusion is a recovery goal and should be routinely assessed.

The aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of VTE in hospitalized psychiatric patients, and to assess the risk factors for VTE in this specific population.	All consecutive adult patients, admitted for a psychiatric disorder for at least seven days in psychiatric units were considered for inclusion. Patients were evaluated for signs and symptoms of VTE during hospitalization. At Day 10, all participants were interviewed and a systematic compression ultrasonography of the lower limbs was performed. Patients were followed-up until Day 90.	Among the 471 included patients, 449 were evaluable at Day 10, and 458 were followed-up until Day 90. Ten deep vein thromboses (DVT) were diagnosed by Day 10 leading to an incidence of VTE of 2.2% (95% CI, 1.1%-4.1%). Six additional symptomatic VTE occurred between Day 10 and Day 90, leading to a 3.5% incidence at Day 90 (95% CI, 2.0%-5.6%). The main factors associated with VTE were age, bed rest, and diagnosis of dementia. The incidence of VTE in patients aged 75 or over with a diagnosis of dementia reached 8.2% at Day 10 and 12.5% at Day 90.	The incidence of VTE in psychiatric units appeared low.

In order to investigate olfactory perception in different depressive states, we carried out olfactory testing during a depressive episode (n=37) and in a remitted state (n=17). As expected, patients were significantly less depressed (p<0.001) and less anhedonic (p=0.001) in the remitted state. A comparison of olfactory perception between age- and gender-matched patients and healthy volunteers (n=37) controlled for intrinsic olfactory deficits in major depression. In the depressive episode, we applied regression analyses to investigate the relation of olfactory hedonics, severity of depression and anhedonia. The Sniffin' Sticks Test extended by analogue rating scales for intensity and hedonic estimates was employed for olfactory testing. Depression severity was assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), anhedonia with the Snaith-Hamilton-Pleasure-Scale (SHAPS). Odour identification ability was significantly reduced during the depressive state. In contrast, no significant differences in hedonic and intensity estimates could be found between the depressive and the remitted state and healthy controls. During the depressive episode, we found a significant relation only between anhedonia and olfactory hedonics. We concluded that anhedonia has potential impact on olfactory hedonics in major depression. Our results indicate the need for (1) confirmatory studies in severe melancholic depression and (2) investigation of the impact of anhedonia on olfactory hedonics in psychiatric diseases other than major depression.",,Remaining,0,0

We hypothesized that somatic burden would mediate relationships between PTSD, pain, and perceived cognitive impairment.	Two samples-360 trauma-exposed college students and 268 mechanical Turk users-completed self-report measures.	Both samples revealed similar findings. There was a significant indirect effect of PTSD and pain on perceived cognitive problems through somatic burden. There remained a direct effect of PTSD symptoms. These findings indicate that in trauma-exposed samples with pain, somatic burden rather than pain severity accounts for perceived cognitive problems.	High somatic burden may reflect an underlying appraisal about somatic cues, which extend in part to interpretation of cognitive cues.",PTSD| appraisals| cognitive functioning| pain| somatic,Remaining,0,0

Studies about comparison of databases provide useful information to help determine which databases or set of databases are useful for a particular topic.	The aim of this study is to examine the coverage and overlap of three commonly used databases in mental health research.	We performed systematic database searches on four topics (ADHD prevalence, schizotypal personality, brain MRI studies in schizophrenia, recovery in schizophrenia) in three databases (PubMed, Web of Science and PsycINFO).

The most comprehensive combination of two databases found 77-94% of the articles on the different topics. Publication year and language affected the coverage in some cases.	When choosing databases, the extent of coverage and topic should be taken into account, as there is no single database that covers all information needs.

The study group comprised 19 patients with NPH who showed a favorable outcome after ventricular shunting, 15 normal volunteers (NV), and 15 patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD). A 3D-fast asymmetric spin echo MR imaging sequence and the region-growing method were used to extract the CSF space from MR images. Ventricular volume (VV) and intracranial CSF volume (ICV) were measured and the VV/ICV ratio was calculated in each case. In NPH patients, the CSF volume was measured again after shunting.	The mean VV and VV/ICV ratio in the NPH group (91.1 mL and 45.2%, respectively) were significantly (p < 0.01) higher than those in the NV group (26.5 mL and 13.7%) and in the CVD group (44.5 mL and 17.8%). On the other hand, mean ICV values were not significantly different among the three groups. The VV was markedly decreased postoperatively (mean -40.7%), whereas the ICV was unchanged, resulting in a marked reduction in the VV/ICV ratio (mean -39.3%).	These results suggest that patients with NPH have a unique intracranial CSF distribution, with an enlarged VV and a slightly increased ICV, resulting in a high VV/ICV ratio. Shunting led to dramatic improvement in our patients. It is likely that CSF measurement can provide valuable information in the management of patients with NPH.",,Remaining,0,0
556,2441955,Electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology,Effects of sleep loss on delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG and eye movement density: new observations and hypotheses.,"One night's sleep loss in young adults increased delta (0.3-3 Hz) EEG only in the first non-REM period of recovery sleep. The delta increase was limited to frequencies 0.3-4 Hz; within this range, the effects on wave form periods and amplitudes differed by frequency band. These results illustrate the value of computer analysis applied to the physiological units of sleep (the successive non-REM and REM periods of each sleep cycle). The finding that all of the delta increase occurred in the first sleep cycle appears inconsistent with the exponential decline of delta across cycles predicted by 'recovery' models of sleep. The fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic (e.g., power spectral density) to index delta sleep. Our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss; we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep; an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations. Lastly, we propose a new hypothesis to account for the presence of eye movement during REM sleep.",,Remaining,0,0

We examined whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted an individual's sleep or their bedpartner's sleep, in couples where one partner experienced insomnia and in couples without sleep disorders.	Fifty-two bed-sharing couples where one individual had insomnia ('Patient'), and 55 non-sleep-disordered couples completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Sleep was monitored for seven nights. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models assessed whether anxiety or depression symptoms predicted individual or dyadic sleep (wake transmission).	Greater anxiety symptoms predicted increased vulnerability to being woken by their bedpartner, as well as increased frequency of waking their bedpartner up during the night in Patients with insomnia, but not in non-sleep-disordered couples. Neither anxiety nor depression symptoms predicted an individual's or their bedpartner's sleep efficiency in either subsample. However, ISI was positively predicted by own anxiety and depression symptoms for Patients with insomnia and in non-sleep-disordered couples.	The non-sleep-disordered subsample experienced only mild symptoms of anxiety and depression, potentially reducing predictive power.	Anxiety may help reveal social determinants of sleep in couples experiencing insomnia.

Specifically, we assayed glioma-associated stem cells (GASC) that are patient-derived and representative of the glioma microenvironment.	By next-generation sequencing, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of GASC derived from patients who underwent anaplastic transformation either within 48 months (GASC-BAD) or ≥7 years (GASC-GOOD) after surgery. Gene set enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses were applied. The prognostic role of a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB) signature derived from GASC-BAD was tested in 530 newly diagnosed diffuse LGG patients comprised within The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The prognostic value of the GASC upstream regulator p65 NF-κB was assessed, by univariate and multivariate Cox analyses, in a single center case study, including 146 grade II LGGs.	The key elements differentiating the transcriptome of GASC isolated from LGG with different prognoses were mostly related to hallmarks of cancer (eg, inflammatory/immune process, NF-κB activation). Consistently, the NF-κB signature extrapolated from the GASC study was prognostic in the dataset of TCGA. Finally, the nuclear expression of the NF-kB-p65 protein, assessed using an inexpensive immunohistochemical method, was an independent predictor of both overall survival and malignant progression-free survival in 146 grade II LGGs.	This study demonstrates for the first time the independent prognostic role of NF-kB activation in LGG and outlines the role of patient-based stem cell models as a tool for precision medicine approaches.",,Remaining,0,0

Patients with unipolar depression were assessed for melancholic status, psychotic symptoms, and severity of depression. The diagnosis of melancholia was made by both Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR), criteria and CORE measure. The DSM criteria assigned a much higher percentage of patients as melancholics (67.4%) than did the CORE (24.9%). Prevalence of psychosis was distinctly higher in the melancholics. Symptoms severity was higher among the melancholics when compared with the nonmelancholics.

The main purpose of this study is to determine whether the obesity paradox measured by body mass index (BMI) or by waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) is real.	We evaluated the association of general obesity measured by BMI, and abdominal obesity measured by WHtR with 1-year all-cause mortality, recurrence of stroke and combined vascular events of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients in a cohort -- the Third China National Stroke Registry (CNSR-III). Cox proportional hazards models and restricted cubic splines were performed to investigate the association between obesity and clinical outcomes.	A total of 14,146 patients with ischemic stroke were included. When BMI was used as a measure of obesity, compared to the normal weight patients, mortality decreased in overweight patients (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.61-0.91], P = 0.0035) and obese patients (HR 0.54 [0.40-0.73], P < 0.0001); and increased in underweight patients (HR 2.55 [1.75-3.73], P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, the protective effect of obesity and overweight disappeared. BMI had no association with recurrence of stroke or combined vascular events. When WHtR was used as a measure of obesity, obese patients had lower 1-year all-cause mortality (HR 0.64 [0.43-0.97], P = 0.0357). After adjustment for confounding factors, this difference disappeared; overweight patients still had lower all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42 [0.26-0.67], P = 0.0003), recurrence of stroke (aHR 0.77 [0.60-0.99], P = 0.0440) and combined vascular events (aHR 0.75 [0.58-0.95], P = 0.0198).

Supplementum,Regional cerebral blood flow and metabolism in patients with chronic obstructive carotid disease.,"Regional cerebral blood flow (CBF), oxygen extraction fraction (OEF) and oxygen consumption (CMRO2) were studied by PET in 26 patients with chronic occlusion(s) or severe stenosis of the internal carotid or middle cerebral artery(ies) without a large (greater than 2 cm) infarction. Most of them showed a coupled decrease of CBF and CMRO2 in the internal carotid distribution. In 5 patients (19%), the CBF in the least perfused but structurally normal tissue was reduced to critically low values while maintaining CMRO2, considerably increasing OEF. Since detection of a lesion with hemodynamic insufficiency was important for the indication for an EC/IC bypass operation, only 19 per cent of the present series would have had an indication for surgery.",,Remaining,0,0

SULEHS is an ultra-rare disorder associated with biallelic loss-of-function variants of the TASP1 gene, and up-to-date, seven patients from five families have been reported in the literature. Loss of TASP1 function has been reported to alter H3K4 histone modifications and expression of TFIIA and HOX transcription factors in the SULEHS phenotype. In this report, a new patient molecularly diagnosed with SULEHS by a novel homozygous c.404-2A > G variant in the TASP1 gene is presented with the long-term follow-up. Although the majority of the patient's clinical characteristics were similar to those of previously reported SULEHS patients, this study was the first to describe some additional anomalies, such as cystic hygroma, increased nuchal thickness, coarctation of the aorta, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary sequestration anomaly, chronic constipation, encephalomalacia, and aggressive behavior. Because of the remarkable similarities between the clinical features of Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS) and the patient, BRWS was considered the most likely diagnosis before the molecular diagnosis. Network analysis also supported that the interaction of the SULEHS-associated TASP1 gene with the BRWS-associated ACTB and ACTG1 genes through common intermediate molecules. Overall, despite the existence of differences in clinical features, inheritance patterns, and underlying pathophysiology between BRWS and SULEHS, both diseases could be considered in the differential diagnosis due to the high clinical similarities, including the dysmorphic features, growth parameters, neurodevelopmental phenotype, neurological problems, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, this report could contribute to a better understanding of the genotypic and clinical features of SULEHS by describing a novel pathogenic variant and new clinical features, such as prenatal manifestations.",Differential diagnosis| Prenatal findings| Pulmonary sequestration| Suleiman-el-Hattab syndrome| TASP1,Remaining,0,0

We retrospectively reviewed the electrocardiograms (ECGs) and medical records of all patients who had been diagnosed with acute intraparynchemal haemorrhage (IPH) between 2006 and 2009.	We included 160 patients (56% males). The median age was 71 years (interquartile range (IQR) 59 to 80) and 69% were above the age of 60 years. Most patients were hypertensive (81%).The majority of patients (86%) had at least one ECG abnormality. Sixty-eight (43%) patients had T-wave inversion and 65 (41%) had QTc interval prolongation. There was a significant association between QTc prolongation and the bleeding size and the presence of midline shift; odd ratios were 2.8 (CI 1.4 to 5.5; P 0.003) and 2.2 (CI 1.1 to 4.2; P 0.04), respectively. In addition, sinus tachycardia was found to be significantly associated with the presence of hydrocephalus (OR 4.1; CI 1.3 to 12.8; P 0.02).	ECG abnormalities are a common finding in patients with IPH. Repolarizaion abnormalities occur the most frequently. QTc prolongation was associated with bleeding size and midline shift.

Because abnormal functional connectivity in these networks has been related to schizophrenia, we tested whether alterations are also evident in subjects at risk for psychosis. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was tested in 28 subjects with basic symptoms reporting subjective cognitive-perceptive symptoms; 19 with attenuated or brief, limited psychotic symptoms; and 29 matched healthy controls. We characterized spatial differences in connectivity patterns, as well as internetwork connectivity. Right anterior insula (rAI) was selected as seed region for identifying the SN; medioprefrontal cortex (MPFC) for the DMN and TPN. The 3 groups differed in connectivity patterns between the MPFC and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (rDLPFC), and between the rAI and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). In particular, the typically observed antagonistic relationship in MPFC-rDLPFC, rAI-PCC, and internetwork connectivity of DMN-TPN was absent in both at-risk groups. Notably, those connectivity patterns were associated with symptoms related to reality distortions, whereas enhanced connectivity strengths of MPFC-rDLPFC and TPN-DMN were related to poor performance in cognitive functions. We propose that the loss of a TPN-DMN anticorrelation, accompanied by an aberrant spatial extent in the DMN, TPN, and SN in the psychosis risk state, reflects the confusion of internally and externally focused states and disturbance of cognition, as seen in psychotic disorders.",anterior insula| anticorrelated networks| brain| central executive network| functional connectivity| intrinsic connectivity| prodrome| resting-state fMRI| schizophrenia,Remaining,0,0

We sought to determine if patients with panic disorder have altered density of NK(1) receptors in brain because of their history of recurrent panic attacks. We also sought to determine if a drug-induced panic attack releases substance P in brain, as measured by decreased binding of [(18)F]SPA-RQ.	Positron emission tomography scans with [(18)F]SPA-RQ were performed in 14 patients with panic disorder and 14 healthy subjects. Of these two groups, 7 patients and 10 healthy subjects were scanned twice, once at baseline and once after injection of doxapram, a drug that induces panic attacks.	NK(1) receptor binding in patients (n = 14) compared with that in healthy subjects (n = 14) was significantly decreased by 12% to 21% in all brain regions. Doxapram effectively produced panic attacks in 6 of 7 patients with panic disorder but only 2 of 10 healthy subjects. Doxapram caused no significant change of [(18)F]SPA-RQ binding in either patients or healthy subjects.

Thus, this study examined which gait and balance parameters best correlate with periventricular LA to better understand the pathogenesis of mobility decline in MCI. High resolution MRI and detailed mobility assessment were performed in 61 subjects (72 years+/-5) with MCI. Cognitive assessment included Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Trail Making test part B (TMB). Mobility assessment included reports of falls in the previous 6-month period, the walking while talking test, the timed 'up and go test' (TUG), measurement of fast gait speed, the standing test and the one-leg standing test. There was an association between marked periventricular LA and slow postural changes, slow gait (TUG and gait speed), altered balance (standing test and one-leg standing test), altered walking while talking test. But after adjusting for age and ventriculomegaly on a logistic multiple regression model, performance on the TUG test was the only clinical predictor of periventricular LA (>10 s, P=0.002). Poorer TUG performances were more frequent with vascular than Alzheimer's disease-like profiles on the FCSRT and TMB tests (P=0.01). In conclusion, the clinical profile of patients demonstrating a main MR brain correlate of mobility dysfunction supports a main pathomechanism of subtle vascular extrapyramidal dysfunction in MCI.",,Remaining,0,0

Neurocognitive dual-process models attribute substance use disorders and risk behaviours during adolescence to an imbalance between an overactivated affective-automatic system (involved in motivational and affective processing) and a reflective system (involved in cognitive inhibitory control). The aim of the present study was to investigate at the electrophysiological level the degree to which the motivational value of alcohol-related stimuli modulates the inhibition of a prepotent response in binge drinkers. First-year university students (n = 151, 54 % females) classified as binge drinkers (n = 71, ≥6 binge drinking episodes, defined as 5/7 standard drinks per occasion in the last 180 days) and controls (n = 80, <6 binge drinking episodes in the last 180 days) performed a beverage Go/NoGo task (pictures of alcoholic and nonalcoholic drinks were presented according to the condition as Go or NoGo stimuli; Go probability = 0.75) during event-related potential recording. In binge drinkers but not controls, the amplitude of the anterior N2-NoGo was larger in response to nonalcohol than in response to alcohol pictures. No behavioural difference in task performance was observed. In terms of dual-process models, binge drinkers may require increased activation to monitor conflict in order to compensate for overactivation of the affective-automatic system caused by alcohol-related bias.",Go/NoGo| adolescence| alcohol consumption| binge drinking| dual-process model| event-related potentials| neurocognitive| response inhibition,Remaining,0,0

To explore the relationship between the QoL of people with dementia and their caregivers in Indonesia.	This is a cross-sectional study using binary correlations to analyze the relationship between people with dementia and caregivers' QoL. Conducted in Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital in Jakarta, the subjects were 42 people diagnosed with dementia according to the PPDGJ-III (adapted from the ICD 10) and 42 primary caregivers with at least 6 hours duration of caregiving per day. The QoL of people with dementia was measured by EuroQol-5D and VAS EQ-5D, while severity of dementia was measured by MMSE. Caregivers underwent an interview using WHO Quality of Life Instrument (WHOQOL-BREF) and NPI.	Most caregivers were women, aged 40-70 years old. The study found caregivers' QoL environmental domain strongly correlated with people with dementia's QoL (r = 0.839). Severity of dementia had a strong correlation with caregivers' QoL physical domain (r = 0.946). Age, duration of caregiving per day, period of care provided by caregivers, and caregiver's distress had a strong correlation with caregiver QoL for specific domains.	There was a strong correlation between people with dementia's QoL and caregiver QoL, so in managing dementia, clinicians should consider caregivers' wellbeing as an essential part significantly affecting the quality of elderly care improvement.",Caregivers| Indonesia| dementia| quality of life,Remaining,0,0

However, previous analyses involving LOHS did not consider confounding or indirect factors, or the effects of other factors on LOHS and inpatient costs.	To investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on the hospitalization costs of inpatients with ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke.	This was a population-based, retrospective, and observational study that analyzed data acquired from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2015 and 2020 relating to ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in Ningxia, China.	Hospitalizations were identified by the International Classification of Diseases 10th Revision (ICD-10). Inpatient costs were described by the median M (P25, P75). We used a quantile regression model to estimate the linear relationships between a group of independent variables X and the quantile of the explained variable hospitalization cost (Y). A structural equation model (SEM) was then used to investigate the direct and indirect effects of LOHS on inpatient costs.	The study included 129,444 patients with ischemic stroke and 15,525 patients with hemorrhagic stroke. The median LOHS was 10 (8-13) days for ischemic stroke and 15 (10-22) days for hemorrhagic stroke. The median M (P25, P75) of inpatient costs was $1020 (742-1545) for ischemic stroke and 2813 (1576-6191) for hemorrhagic stroke. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs was 0.795 in patients with ischemic stroke. The effect of yearof discharge (X4) and CCI (X8) on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through the LOHS. The indirect effect was -0.071 (84.52% of the total effect value) and 0.034 (69.39% of the total effect value), respectively. The total effect of LOHS on inpatient costs in patients with hemorrhagic stroke was 0.754. The influence of CCI on inpatient costs was dominated by an indirect effect through LOHS; the indirect effect value was -0.028 (77.78% of the total effect value). The payment type, surgery, method of discharge, and hospital level also exerted an impact on inpatient costs by direct and indirect effects through the LOHS.	Length of hospital stay (LOHS) was identified as the main factor influencing hospitalization costs. However, other social factors were shown to indirectly influence hospitalization costs through the LOHS. Taking effective measures to further reduce hospitalization costs remains an effective way to control hospitalization costs for stroke patients.",costs| length of hospital stay (LOS)| quantile regression| stroke| structural equation models (SEMs),Remaining,0,0

The testing battery consisted of a Bobath evaluation, the Brunnstrom scale, the Fugl-Meyer test, the Upper Extremity Functional Test (UEFT) and the Present Pain Intensity (PPI) of the McGill pain questionnaire. A Friedman analysis of variance showed that, except for pain, all the protocols used disclosed significant progress (p less than 0.001) over time in terms of motor recovery. Except for pain, the results of the Bobath evaluation were significantly correlated (Spearman's Rho, p less than 0.001) with the results of the other testing procedures. It is concluded that the new Bobath evaluation proposed in a previous paper is as sensitive in depicting progress in motor recovery over time as are the other testing procedures used. Furthermore, this new evaluation seems to be measuring similar properties to the other tests. However, pain (PPI) appears not to be an important dependent variable.",,Remaining,0,0

Underreporting of fidelity in primary care randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of complex interventions reduces our confidence that findings are due to the treatment or intervention being investigated, rather than unknown confounders.	We aimed to investigate treatment fidelity (for the purpose of this paper, hereafter referred to as intervention fidelity), of an educational intervention delivered to general practice teams and designed to improve the primary care management of insomnia.	We conducted telephone interviews with patients and practitioners participating in the intervention arm of the trial to explore trial fidelity. Qualitative analysis was undertaken using constant comparison and a priori themes (categories): 'adherence to the delivery of the intervention', 'patients received and understood intervention' and 'patient enactment'.	If the intervention protocol was not adhered to by the practitioner then patient receipt, understanding and enactment levels were reduced. Recruitment difficulties in terms of the gap between initially being recruited into the study and attending an intervention consultation also reduced the effectiveness of the intervention. Patient attributes such as motivation to learn and engage contributed to the success of the uptake of the intervention.	Qualitative methods using brief telephone interviews are an effective way of collecting the depth of data required to assess intervention fidelity.

These studies were performed with ligands, such as ketanserin, altanserin and LSD, that may bind with high-affinity to different structural or functional conformations of the 5-HT(2A)R. Interpretation of results may also be confounded by chronic antipsychotic treatment and suicidal behavior in the schizophrenia group. We quantified 5-HT(2A)R density by radioligand binding assays in postmortem prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free (n=29) and antipsychotic-treated (n=16) schizophrenics, suicide victims with other psychiatric diagnoses (n=13), and individually matched controls. [[3]H]Ketanserin binding, and its displacement by altanserin or the LSD-like agonist DOI, was assayed. Results indicate that the number of [[3]H]ketanserin binding sites to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free (128 ± 11%), but not in antipsychotic-treated (92 ± 12%), schizophrenic subjects. In suicide victims, [[3]H]ketanserin binding did not differ as compared to controls. Aging correlated negatively with [[3]H]ketanserin binding in schizophrenia, suicide victims and controls. The fraction of high-affinity sites of DOI displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R was increased in antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects. Functional uncoupling of heterotrimeric G proteins led to increased fraction of high-affinity sites of altanserin displacing [[3]H]ketanserin binding to the 5-HT(2A)R in schizophrenic subjects, but not in controls. Together, these results suggest that the active conformation of the 5-HT(2A)R is up-regulated in prefrontal cortex of antipsychotic-free schizophrenic subjects, and may provide a pharmacological explanation for discordant findings previously obtained.",Postmortem human brain| Radioligand binding| Schizophrenia| Serotonin| Serotonin 5-HT2A receptor| Suicide,Remaining,0,0

582,25330102,PloS one,Modeling the dynamics of disease states in depression.,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and costly disorder associated with considerable morbidity, disability, and risk for suicide. The disorder is clinically and etiologically heterogeneous. Despite intense research efforts, the response rates of antidepressant treatments are relatively low and the etiology and progression of MDD remain poorly understood. Here we use computational modeling to advance our understanding of MDD. First, we propose a systematic and comprehensive definition of disease states, which is based on a type of mathematical model called a finite-state machine. Second, we propose a dynamical systems model for the progression, or dynamics, of MDD. The model is abstract and combines several major factors (mechanisms) that influence the dynamics of MDD. We study under what conditions the model can account for the occurrence and recurrence of depressive episodes and how we can model the effects of antidepressant treatments and cognitive behavioral therapy within the same dynamical systems model through changing a small subset of parameters. Our computational modeling suggests several predictions about MDD. Patients who suffer from depression can be divided into two sub-populations: a high-risk sub-population that has a high risk of developing chronic depression and a low-risk sub-population, in which patients develop depression stochastically with low probability. The success of antidepressant treatment is stochastic, leading to widely different times-to-remission in otherwise identical patients. While the specific details of our model might be subjected to criticism and revisions, our approach shows the potential power of computationally modeling depression and the need for different type of quantitative data for understanding depression.",,Remaining,0,0

When the lifetime prevalence of stroke was divided according to whether stroke had been diagnosed for the first time at the age of 90 years or less or over the age of 90, a significant positive association between hypertension and stroke was more pronounced in centenarians with a diagnosis of stroke at the age of 90 years or less than in those over the age of 90.	The findings suggest that hypertension may increase the likelihood of stroke in Japanese centenarians in Okinawa although the association between hypertension and stroke was more pronounced in those having stroke at 90 years or younger.",,Remaining,0,0

A regional cohort of 81 of 84 ELBW survivors born between 1980 and 1982 were reassessed at age 8 years by Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R), Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R), and tests of motor function. The association of FKSB risk status and WRAT-R reading subtest for predicting general reading disability in the overall sample at age 8 years resulted in a sensitivity of 0.68, specificity of 0.48, and a likelihood ratio of 1.3. Of the 43 'normal' children at age 5 years with no neurosensory impairments and IQ > or = 84 (McCarthy GCI), 49% were considered to be at 'mild' to 'high' risk for future LD. The prevalence of specific LD (reading disorder) at age 8 years in children with normal IQ (WISC-R > or = 85) was 28%. The positive predictive value of the 5-year FKSB for identifying children with specific LD at age 8 years was 0.20 (sensitivity 0.33, specificity 0.48). We conclude the FKSB is not an efficient tool for predicting either general or specific LD in ELBW children.",,Remaining,0,0

Between 1996 and 1998, with the assistance of the Twin Association and junior high schools in Taipei City, we solicited a list of twins from 51 junior high schools in Taipei. Names, addresses, and telephone numbers of the twins enrolled in these schools were obtained. The vast majority of the recruited twins were between 12 and 16 years old. The recruited twins received assessments for behavioral problems, general and schizotypal personality, and cognitive functions. Their parents rated their children on behavioral/ emotional problems and were assessed on their own general and specific personality. Same-sex sibling pairs (ages vary within 2 years) and their parents from three schools were also recruited to increase sample size for the group with a kinship coefficient of .50. Twins' zygosity was determined by a combination of DNA typing and physical similarity. The Mx program was used to estimate parameters for the full model and its reduced models.

592,15907750,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Differentiating anxiety and depression symptoms in patients with partial epilepsy.,"Anxiety and depression are separate psychiatric conditions that are often interrelated. This study examines whether they exist independently in this population of patients with partial epilepsy and if they affect all quality-of-life domains. Adult epilepsy patients taking two or more antiepileptic drugs completed a health status survey including demographic items, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy-10 (QOLIE-10). The questionnaire was completed by 201 epilepsy patients. Symptom prevalences of anxiety (52% none, 25% mild, 16% moderate, 7% severe) and depression (62% none, 20% mild, 14% moderate, 4% severe) were high. All health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL) domains worsened significantly with increasing levels of anxiety and depression: Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 72+/-18 in patients with no anxiety to 54+/-13 in those with mild, 48+/-18 in those with moderate, and 40+/-23 in those with severe anxiety (P<0.0001). Total QOLIE-10 scores decreased from 70+/-16 in patients with no depression to 50+/-16 in those with mild, 45+/-16 in those with moderate, and 24+/-21 in those with severe depression (P<0.0001). No significant difference in anxiety scores was observed controlling for seizure frequency or epilepsy duration. Regression analyses showed that anxiety and depression account for different proportions of variance as predictors of HRQOL (R2=0.337 (anxiety) and 0.511 (depression)). The data suggest that patients may benefit from increased attention to the role of anxiety separately from depression.",,Remaining,0,0
593,17996378,Neuroscience,Working memory load-related electroencephalographic parameters can differentiate progressive from stable mild cognitive impairment.,"Recent studies described several changes of endogenous event-related potentials (ERP) and brain rhythm synchronization during memory activation in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). To examine whether memory-related EEG parameters may predict cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we assessed P200 and N200 latencies as well as beta event-related synchronization (ERS) in 16 elderly controls (EC), 29 MCI cases and 10 patients with AD during the successful performance of a pure attentional detection task as compared with a highly working memory demanding two-back task. At 1 year follow-up, 16 MCI patients showed progressive cognitive decline (PMCI) and 13 remained stable (SMCI). Both P200 and N200 latencies in the two-back task were longer in PMCI and AD cases compared with EC and SMCI cases. During the interval 1000 ms to 1700 ms after stimulus, beta ERS at parietal electrodes was of lower amplitude in PMCI and AD compared with EC and SMCI cases. Univariate models showed that P200, N200 and log% beta values were significantly related to the SMCI/PMCI distinction with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93, 0.78 and 0.72, respectively. The combination of all three EEG hallmarks was the stronger predictor of MCI deterioration with 90% of correctly classified MCI cases. Our data reveal that PMCI and clinically overt AD share the same pattern of working memory-related EEG activation characterized by increased P200-N200 latencies and decreased beta ERS. They also show that P200 latency during the two-back task may be a simple and promising EEG marker of rapid cognitive decline in MCI.",,Remaining,0,0

Median age during follow-up was 15 years (range 5-23). The most common malignancies were brain tumors, lymphoma, retinoblastoma and Wilm's tumor. The 174 late side-effects included endocrine disorders (19%), cognitive impairment (14%), orthopedic dysfunction (12%), alopecia (12%), dental damage (11%), psychological (8%) and neurological (8%) disturbances, and azoospermia or amenorrhea (5%). There was no cardiac or renal damage and no second malignancy. 29% of side-effects were severe. There was significant reduction in quality of life in 54 (49%), in 27 of whom it was severe enough to require psychological intervention. Treatment of brain tumor caused 98 late side-effects in 28 patients (sequelae-to-patient ratio [SPR] 3.3). Most cognitive, endocrine and neurological disorders, and most cases of alopecia, dental and psychological difficulties were in these patients. There were frequent late complications in those treated for retinoblastoma (SPR 1.8), and bone or soft tissue sarcomas (SPR 0.8). Those treated for Wilm's tumor had few side-effects (SPR 0.4). Late side effects were most frequent after radiation, reaching as high as SPR 2.4. It averaged only 0.5 in those treated with chemotherapy alone or in combination with surgery. Reduction of late side-effects in these patients requires using less toxic modalities, as long as cure rate is not compromised. When considering secondary strategies, screening for early detection of late complications would enable immediate solutions, such as hormonal replacement or providing compensating skills for post-treatment disability.",,Remaining,0,0

The present study aimed to comprehensively examine the psychometric profile and criterion-related validity of an 18-item RAPI adapted to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use in an at-risk adolescent population.	Categorical confirmatory factor analysis and the graded response model were used for evaluations of the latent factor structure, item properties, test information, and item invariance across gender, age groups (middle vs. late adolescence), and drug use profiles (readily available drugs vs. other illicit drugs), as well as computation of the item response theory scale scores for each of 617 alternative high school students (44% female).	A reduced set of 16 RAPI items provided plausible evidence of unidimensionality and good measurement precision at a relatively wide range of the latent trait continuum. All but two items were invariant across the drug use profiles. The other illicit drug group had higher levels of the latent substance-related problems than the readily available drug group. Criterion-related validity was supported using a measure of past-year polysubstance use.	The RAPI can be effectively modified to measure negative consequences resulting from alcohol and other drug use and reflects a sufficiently wide range of the latent continuum of problem use.",,Remaining,0,0

Furthermore to study the consequences of pain and to identify pain-exacerbating and pain-relieving factors.	In a national survey, fifty-five adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy completed a questionnaire assessing pain frequency, duration, location using a body map, intensity and discomfort using visual analogue scales, pain interference using a modified version of Brief Pain Inventory and factors exacerbating and relieving pain.	Sixty-nine per cent of the adolescents reported pain during the past three months and 50% reported chronic pain. The pain prevalence did not differ significantly between diagnostic groups or between ambulators and non-ambulators. The average pain intensity was graded as mild and the worst pain as moderate. The pain typically occurred weekly, most frequently in the neck/back or legs. General activity and mood were the areas that were most affected by pain. Common pain-exacerbating factors were sitting, too much movement/activity and being lifted or transferred.	Pain is a frequent problem in adolescents with spinal muscular atrophy and dystrophinopathy. The assessments used enable an understanding both of the nature and scope of pain and of the impact of pain in everyday life.

A pilot study.,"The Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) estimates the cognitive aptitudes and other skills of severely impaired dementia patients. The main objective of this pilot study was to clearly identify the number of factors present in the SIB and to analyze the relationships between the different cognitive domains explored by the SIB and loss of autonomy. We administered the SIB, the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and two scales of dependency to 48 patients with Alzheimer's disease in its late stages. A factorial analysis (Principal Components Analysis) showed a 4-factor solution for the SIB: a cognitive factor, a praxis and visuospatial functions factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. A factorial analysis involving the dependency scales showed a cognitive factor, a dependency and constructional praxis factor, the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor. Reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes were not significantly correlated to cognitive aspects nor to dependency. The finding of dependency as a factor different from cognitive deterioration suggests that, in setting a treatment strategy for demented patients, attempts should be made to treat dependency in its own right. In addition, since reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes are not related to cognitive aspects nor to dependency, these functions should also be encouraged and stimulated.",,Remaining,0,0

Patients' views have seldom been considered in the construction of measures addressing satisfaction with inpatient facilities in psychiatry. The Views on Inpatient Care - VOICE - is a first service-user generated outcome measure relying solely on their perceptions of acute care, representing a valuable indicator of service users' perceived quality of care. The present study aimed to contribute to the validation of the Portuguese version of VOICE.	The questionnaire was translated into Portuguese and applied to a sample of eighty-five female inpatients of a psychiatric institution. Data analysis focused on assessing reliability and exploring the impact of demographic and clinical variables on participants' satisfaction.	Internal consistency of the questionnaire was high (α = 0.87). Participants' age and marital status were associated with differences in scores, with older patients and patients who were married or involved in a close relationship presenting higher satisfaction levels.	The questionnaire demonstrated good internal consistency and acceptability, as well as construct validity. Further studies should expand the analysis of the psychometric properties of this measure e.g., test-retest reliability.	The Portuguese version of VOICE is a promising tool to assess service users' perceptions of inpatient psychiatric care in Portugal.	Introdução: A satisfação com os serviços de saúde é uma medida importante da qualidade dos cuidados formais prestados. Os doentes raramente têm sido envolvidos na construção de instrumentos para avaliar a satisfação com estruturas de internamento psiquiátrico. A medida Views on Inpatient Care (VOICE) recorre, pela primeira vez, às perceções dos próprios doentes sobre um internamento em cuidados agudos, apresentando-se como um indicador valioso da qualidade dos cuidados tal como percebida pelos utentes. O presente estudo visou contribuir para a validação da versão portuguesa desta medida. Material e Métodos: O questionário foi traduzido e adaptado para português, e aplicado a uma amostra de 85 mulheres admitidas num serviço de internamento psiquiátrico. A análise focou-se na consistência interna da medida e no impacto das variáveis demográficas e clínicas nos níveis de satisfação. Resultados: A consistência interna foi elevada (α = 0,87). Encontrámos associações entre a idade e o estado civil e as pontuações obtidas: doentes mais velhos e doentes casados, ou vivendo maritalmente, apresentaram níveis mais elevados de satisfação. Discussão: O questionário apresentou boa consistência interna e aceitabilidade entre os participantes, bem como validade de constructo. As propriedades psicométricas da escala deverão ser exploradas em vertentes adicionais, como a fiabilidade teste-reteste.

600,26940435,Scientific reports,"Intratumoral heterogeneity identified at the epigenetic, genetic and transcriptional level in glioblastoma.","Heterogeneity is a hallmark of glioblastoma with intratumoral heterogeneity contributing to variability in responses and resistance to standard treatments. Promoter methylation status of the DNA repair enzyme O(6)-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is the most important clinical biomarker in glioblastoma, predicting for therapeutic response. However, it does not always correlate with response. This may be due to intratumoral heterogeneity, with a single biopsy unlikely to represent the entire lesion. Aberrations in other DNA repair mechanisms may also contribute. This study investigated intratumoral heterogeneity in multiple glioblastoma tumors with a particular focus on the DNA repair pathways. Transcriptional intratumoral heterogeneity was identified in 40% of cases with variability in MGMT methylation status found in 14% of cases. As well as identifying intratumoral heterogeneity at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels, targeted next generation sequencing identified between 1 and 37 unique sequence variants per specimen. In-silico tools were then able to identify deleterious variants in both the base excision repair and the mismatch repair pathways that may contribute to therapeutic response. As these pathways have roles in temozolomide response, these findings may confound patient management and highlight the importance of assessing multiple tumor biopsies.",,Remaining,0,0

However, the optimal site for measurement of arterial calcification has not been determined. The primary aim of this study was to examine the pattern of arterial calcification in different stages of CKD.	This was an observational, cross-sectional study that included 580 individuals with CKD stages 1-5 (no dialysis) from the Copenhagen CKD Cohort. Calcification of the carotid, coronary and iliac arteries, thoracic and abdominal aorta was assessed using non-contrast multidetector computed tomography scans and quantified according to the Agatston method. Based on the distribution of Agatston scores in the selected arterial region, the subjects were divided into calcium score categories of 0 (no calcification), 1-100, 101-400 and > 400.	Participants with CKD stages 3-5 had the highest prevalence of calcification and the highest frequency of calcium scores > 400 in all arterial sites. Calcification in at least one arterial site was present in > 90% of patients with CKD stage 3. In all five CKD stages prevalence of calcification was greatest in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. These arterial sites also showed the highest calcium scores. High calcium scores (> 400) in all five arterial regions were independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease. In multivariable analyses, after adjusting for cardiovascular risk factors, declining creatinine clearance was associated with increasing calcification of the coronary arteries (p = 0.012) and the thoracic aorta (p = 0.037) only.	Arterial calcification is highly prevalent throughout all five CKD stages and is most prominent in both the thoracic and abdominal aorta, and in the iliac arteries. Follow-up studies are needed to explore the potential of extracardiac calcification sites in prediction of cardiovascular events in the CKD population.",Abdominal aorta| Arterial calcification| Calcium score| Cardiovascular disease| Carotid arteries| Chronic kidney disease| Coronary arteries| Iliac arteries| Thoracic aorta| Vascular calcification,Remaining,0,0

The case of Brazil.,"To investigate trends in the provision of mental health services and financing in Brazil.	Data from DATASUS (the Brazilian Unified Health Computerized System) with free access in the web were collected regarding the number of beds, the development of new community centers, the number of mental health professionals, and costs involved from 1995 to 2005.	In ten years, the number of psychiatric beds decreased 41% (5.4 to 3.2 per 10,000 inhabitants) while community services have increased nine-fold (0.004 to 0.037 per 10,000 inhabitants). Psychologists and social workers have accounted for three and two-fold, respectively, as much hirings as psychiatrists. Psychiatric admissions accounted for 95.5% of the budget in 1995 and 49% in 2005, and the expenses with community services and medication have increased 15% each. As a whole, the expenses in mental health decreased by 26.7% (2.66 to 1.95 US$ per capita).	There has been a clear switch from hospital to community psychiatric care in Brazil, where the system can now provide a diversity of treatments and free access to psychotropics. However, the coverage of community services is precarious, and the reform was not accompanied by an increased public investment in mental health. The psychiatric reform is not a strategy for reducing costs; it necessarily implies increasing investments if countries decide to have a better care of those more disadvantaged.",,Remaining,0,0
615,21320253,Bipolar disorders,Pain and rejection sensitivity in bipolar depression.,"Little is known regarding the correlates of pain in bipolar disorder. Recent neuroimaging studies support the contention that depression, as well as pain distress and rejection distress, share the same neurobiological circuits. In a recently published study, we confirmed the hypothesis that perception of increased pain during treatment-refractory depression, predominantly unipolar, was related to increased rejection sensitivity. In the present study, we aimed to test this same hypothesis for bipolar depression.	The present study analysed data from 67 patients presenting to the Black Dog Institute Bipolar Disorders Clinic in Sydney, Australia. The patients all met DSM-IV criteria for bipolar disorder and had completed a self-report questionnaire regarding perceived pain and rejection sensitivity during depression.	A significant increase in the experience of headaches (p=0.003) as well as chest pain (p=0.004) during bipolar depression was predicted by a major increase in rejection sensitivity when depressed, i.e., state rejection sensitivity. Being rejection sensitive in general, i.e., trait rejection sensitivity, did not predict pain during depression.	The experience of increased headaches and chest pain during bipolar depression is related to increased rejection sensitivity during depression. Research to further elucidate this relationship is required.",,Remaining,0,0

A retrospective chart review of 107 neonates with NEC (Bell stage > IIa) from Jan 2013- June 2020 was completed. Demographic, clinical, and outcome data were compared between infants with or without placental pathologic lesions.	In this cohort, 59/107 (55%) infants had medical NEC, and 48 (45%) had surgical NEC. The infants had a mean gestational age of 28.1±3.7 weeks and a birth weight of 1103±647 g. Maternal vascular malperfusion (82/107, 76.6%) and acute histological chorioamnionitis (42, 39.3%) were the most common pathological placental lesions. Acute histologic chorioamnionitis with fetal inflammatory response was more common in infants with surgical NEC vs. medical NEC (35.4% vs. 15.3%; p = 0.02). The NEC Infants with WMI on brain MRI scans had a significantly higher incidence of acute histological chorioamnionitis (52% vs. 27.8%; P = 0.04). No significant differences in mortality, length of stay and postoperative outcomes in neonates with and without acute histologic chorioamnionitis with fetal inflammatory response were noted. On unadjusted logistic regression, acute histologic chorioamnionitis without fetal inflammatory response was also associated with higher odds of WMI (OR 2.81; 95% CI 1.05-7.54; p = 0.039).

The analysis focused on determinants of the health of young people and the role of school settings in the optimisation of health.	Records were examined from the Canadian sample of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) Survey. 3402 young people in Ontario, Canada were administered this survey in 2006, of which 1966 were re-administered the survey 1 year later and supplied complete data. Individual items and factor-analytically derived scales were used to examine potential aetiological relationships in a series of structural equation models. Health outcomes examined were serious injury and psychosomatic symptoms. Models developed from cross-sectional data were confirmed longitudinally.	Adolescents who reported negative home and school environments reported higher levels of substance use, psychosomatic symptoms and serious injuries (the latter identified in longitudinal analysis only). Engagement in health risk behaviour partially mediated the link between these two environments and the sentinel health outcomes. Positive school environments were protective in that they moderated associations between negative home environments and engagement in health risk behaviours. The effects observed in longitudinal analyses were generally consistent with those observed cross-sectionally.	Negative home environments clearly place adolescents at risk for engagement in health risk behaviours and associated physical health outcomes. Positive school environments can in part moderate these relationships. Optimisation of school social environments therefore remains warranted as a population health strategy.",,Remaining,0,0

Two cross-sectional surveys 20 years apart.	The surveys were performed at two Norwegian medical faculties in 1993 and 2015.	One hundred and seventy-four first-year medical students in 1993 were compared with 169 students in 2015.	Mental distress (Hopkins Symptom Checklist 5) and Mental Health Problems in Need of Treatment.	Mental distress increased from 1993 to 2015 (p<0.001) due to a larger increase among female students, which seemed to be of clinical importance (Cohen's d=0.63). There was a significant gender difference in mental distress in 2015 (p=0.007), but not in 1993. Independent factors associated with mental distress in 2015 were female sex (p<0.001), low perceived social support from parents (p=0.023) and low perceived social support from other friends (p=0.048). Additional analyses showed that social support from friends was more important for female students than for their male peers. From 1993 to 2015, there was no significant increase in the proportion of female students reporting previous mental health problems in need of treatment (21.3% vs 27.8%), but we found a significant increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment over these years from 30.0% (6/20) to 74.3% (26/35; p=0.003).	We found a significant increase in mental distress among female medical students over the past 20 years, but also a promising increase in help-seeking among those in need of treatment. The strong and important association between low social support and mental distress should urge both universities and students to maintain students' social life after entering medical school.",anxiety disorders| depression & mood disorders| epidemiology| medical education & training| mental health,Remaining,0,0

Diabetes mellitus, hypertension,cardiomyopathy, and obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome(OSAS) are frequent complications.	Identify a useful system to obtain a reliable remote monitoring of glucose and the most important vital parameters in the acromegalic subjects.	Sixteen acromegalic patients (from 30 to 73 years old) were enrolled. We provided health monitor devices to the patients for continuous acquisition of physiological signals including twelve-lead electrocardiography (EKG) and nocturnal SpO2. At the same time, we applied on the same patients the blinded continuous glucose monitoring system(CGMS).	The lowest saturation peaks at night (<80%) were achieved in patients with a known diagnosis of OSAS. A positive correlation was demonstrated between the lowest oxygen saturation values and the CGM peaks (pV <0,0001) and between the average values of oxygen saturation and CGM (pV<0,0003). Patients with a previous diagnosis of OSAS, obtained by polysomnography, showed on the multiparametric monitor recordings superimposable to their known condition. Instead we noticed a discordance in the two EKG recording: the wireless mode showed an irregular rhythm in 5/16 patients, which was not confirmed by the recording mode with cables.	The health monitor device associated with CGM may be a new useful and versatile tool for fragile patients who can self-manage remote monitoring, and for physicians who can obtain real-time information for the clinical and therapeutic management of patients. It is also a useful tool for the follow-up of patients with OSAS.

We examined within-trial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by Kristjansson (2000) (modified from Horowitz & Wolfe, 1998), in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next (the relocation condition), as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration. To equate appearance between the two conditions, all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions, and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays. The results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls, but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients, not the left, indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted, and to a greater degree than for their right visual space, in contrast to what has been previously argued.",,Remaining,0,0

Direct contact with patients during pharmacy experiential education helps establish positive attitudes toward people with mental illness yet may not be available to all students. The use of film in pharmacy education has the potential to facilitate learning and improve attitudes.	We evaluated students' perceptions regarding the impact of an elective course for pharmacy students which incorporated feature films about mental illnesses. Students completed surveys addressing their perceptions of each film's role in facilitation of learning, attitudes about mental illness, and comfort level for interacting with patients with mental illness.	A total of 125 students completed a course featuring 17 films over the four-year study period. The films with the highest weighted positive rankings were Temple Grandin, Helen, As Good As It Gets, Born on the Fourth of July, Iris, A Beautiful Mind, and Silver Linings Playbook. Less favored films included One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Prozac Nation, and My Own Private Idaho.	Direct contact with patients may best prepare future pharmacists to serve the needs of people with mental illness. This study suggests that students perceive feature films used in an elective course may have a positive impact on facilitating learning and improving attitudes of pharmacy students toward individuals with mental illness.

625,19308881,Pharmacopsychiatry,Drug prescription patterns in schizophrenia outpatients: analysis of data from a German health insurance fund.,"The aim of this study was to investigate routine administrative data from a major German health insurance fund, Techniker Krankenkasse, which covers 5.4 million insured individuals. Using a retrospective cohort design, this study analysed data collected from patients with a hospital diagnosis of schizophrenia in 2003 (index hospitalisation) in order to evaluate prescription patterns of antipsychotic drugs.	Patients with an ICD-10 diagnosis of schizophrenia, at least one year prior membership with the insurance fund and a follow-up period of one year were identified. Results were standardised by age and stratified by the severity of their illness, defined by the number of hospital bed days during the three years preceding the index hospitalisation.	A total of 3,121 patients with schizophrenia (male 56.4%, female 43.6%) received 56 692 single prescriptions of antipsychotics. Of these, 35.4% of the prescriptions were for typical and 64.6% for atypical antipsychotics; 55% were for high-potency, 45% for low-potency typical antipsychotics. The most frequently prescribed drugs were olanzapine (26.6%), clozapine (21.3%) and risperidone (19%). There were no relevant gender differences concerning prescription patterns. During a 12-month follow-up period after the first hospitalisation, 1 372 patients (43.9%) were treated exclusively with an atypical antipsychotic, another 499 patients (16%) had a combination of an atypical plus a low-potency typical antipsychotic. Thus, basal therapy with an atypical was observed in 59.9% of our study population. Only 327 patients (10.5%) were treated exclusively with a typical antipsychotic. A total of 645 patients (20.7%) were treated with a combination of atypical plus typical antipsychotic. Changes of medication within one substance group occurred more often with typical antipsychotics (50%) as compared to atypical antipsychotics (25%).	At 60%, the proportion of patients in this study treated with atypical antipsychotics was surprisingly high. Of significant interest is the frequent prescription of clozapine (14%).

A total of 1,421 measurements in 15 epileptic patients (age: 28 ± 10) using a radiofrequency generator (50 kHz current injection) were analyzed. Each contact pair was classified as being from healthy (gray matter, n = 696; white matter, n = 530) or pathological (epileptogenic zone, n = 195) tissue using neuroimaging analysis of the local tissue environment and intracerebral EEG recordings. Brain tissue conductivities were obtained using numerical simulations based on conductivity estimates that accounted for the current flow in the local brain volume around the contact pairs (a cube with a side length of 13 mm). Conductivity values were 0.26 S/m for gray matter and 0.17 S/m for white matter. Healthy gray and white matter had statistically different median impedances (P < 0.0001). White matter conductivity was found to be homogeneous as normality tests did not find evidence of multiple subgroups. Gray matter had lower conductivity in healthy tissue than in the epileptogenic zone (0.26 vs. 0.29 S/m; P = 0.012), even when the epileptogenic zone was not visible in the magnetic resonance image (MRI) (P = 0.005). The present in-vivo conductivity values could serve to create more accurate volume conduction models and could help to refine the identification of relevant intracerebral contacts, especially when located within the epileptogenic zone of an MRI-invisible lesion.

Twenty-four patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who reported hallucinated voices were compared with 21 patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders who did not report voices and 26 normal subjects. Narrative speech perception was assessed through use of a masked speech tracking task with three levels of superimposed phonetic noise. A sentence repetition task was used to assess grammar-dependent verbal working memory, and an auditory continuous performance task was used to assess nonlanguage attention.	Masked speech tracking task and sentence repetition performance by hallucinating patients was impaired relative to both nonhallucinating patients and normal subjects. Although both hallucinating and nonhallucinating patients demonstrated auditory attention impairments when compared to normal subjects, the two patient groups did not differ with respect to these variables.	Results support the hypothesis that hallucinated voices in schizophrenia arise from disrupted speech perception and verbal working memory systems rather than from nonlanguage cognitive or attentional deficits.",,Remaining,0,0
631,35922871,Alzheimer's research & therapy,Inflammatory plasma biomarkers in subjects with preclinical Alzheimer's disease.,"This study investigated plasma biomarkers for neuroinflammation associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly. How these biomarkers behave in patients with AD, compared to healthy elderly is well known, but determining these in subjects with preclinical AD is not and will add information related to the onset of AD. When found to be different in preclinical AD, these inflammatory biomarkers may be used to select preclinical AD subjects who are most likely to develop AD, to participate in clinical trials with new disease-modifying drugs.	Healthy elderly (n= 50; age 71.9; MMSE >24) and subjects with preclinical AD (n=50; age 73.4; MMSE >24) defined by CSF Aβ1-42 levels < 1000 pg/mL were included. Four neuroinflammatory biomarkers were determined in plasma, GFAP, YKL-40, MCP-1, and eotaxin-1. Differences in biomarker outcomes were compared using ANCOVA. Subject characteristics age, gender, and APOE ε4 status were reported per group and were covariates in the ANCOVA. Least square means were calculated for all 4 inflammatory biomarkers using both the Aβ+/Aβ- cutoff and Ptau/Aβ1-42 ratio.	The mean (standard deviation, SD) age of the subjects (n=100) was 72.6 (4.6) years old with 62 male and 38 female subjects. Mean (SD) overall MMSE score was 28.7 (0.49) and 32 subjects were APOE ε4 carriers. The number of subjects in the different APOE ε4 status categories differed significantly between the Aβ+ and Aβ- groups. Plasma GFAP concentration was significantly higher in the Aβ+ group compared to the Aβ- group with significant covariates age and sex, variables that also correlated significantly with GFAP.	GFAP was significantly higher in subjects with preclinical AD compared to healthy elderly which agrees with previous studies. When defining preclinical AD based on the Ptau181/Aβ1-42 ratio, YKL-40 was also significantly different between groups. This could indicate that GFAP and YKL-40 are more sensitive markers of the inflammatory process in response to the Aβ misfolding and aggregation that is ongoing as indicated by the lowered Aβ1-42 levels in the CSF. Characterizing subjects with preclinical AD using neuroinflammatory biomarkers is important for subject selection in new disease-modifying clinical trials.

Latent class analyses were used to characterize polysubstance abuse/dependence (AB/D) in 43 093 individuals who participated in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions. Multinomial logistic regression was performed to examine the association between the classes of life-time illicit drug AB/D and gender, age and race, as well as life-time Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM-IV) alcohol abuse/dependence, nicotine dependence, major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social phobia and antisocial personality disorder.	Five latent classes were identified: no AB/D (class 1: 92.5%), cannabis AB/D only (class 2: 5.8%), stimulants + hallucinogen AB/D (class 3: 0.6%), prescription drug AB/D (class 4: 0.6%) and polysubstance AB/D (class 5: 0.5%). Major depressive disorder and nicotine dependence were associated most strongly with class 5. Anxiety disorders were associated strongly with the prescription drug AB/D class while alcohol AB/D and ASPD were associated with classes 2, 3, 4 and 5 when compared to the reference class (class 1).	Significant heterogeneity exists in this US population for polysubstance AB/D patterns with evidence for a subgroup with high rates of sedative, tranquilizer and opiate AB/D and a history of anxiety disorders, a stimulant/hallucinogens group, a high-risk group with elevated rates of all psychiatric disorders and a milder cannabis AB/D only group.

633,3562743,Psychoneuroendocrinology,Psychopathological correlates of plasma cortisol after dexamethasone suppression: a polydiagnostic approach.,"Seventy-seven consecutively admitted inpatients with depressive syndromes were examined with the Present State Examination and classified according to eight different operational diagnoses of endogenous depression. All patients received a 1.5 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST). Sensitivity, specificity and the corrected predictive values of DST nonsuppression (50 or more ng/ml at 0800 hr, 1600 hr, or 2300 hr), adjusted to a 50% prevalence of endogenous and nonendogenous depression, varied considerably depending on the diagnostic definition used. The highest predictive value (89.9%) was found with the Taylor-Abrams criteria (sensitivity = 43.9%, specificity = 95.0%), and the lowest predictive value (53.3%) with DSM-III (sensitivity = 37.7%, specificity = 68.1%). Eliminating the patients with dexamethasone levels of less than 2000 pg/ml improved the diagnostic specificity of the DST for most of the eight definitions of endogenous depression. This further indicates that plasma dexamethasone levels should be analyzed in studies designed to explore the diagnostic utility of the DST. A significant, chance-corrected association between DST nonsuppression and the diagnosis of endogenous depression was found with clinical diagnosis (according to the International Classification of Diseases), and for four out of eight operational diagnoses (Newcastle Scale I, Newcastle Scale II, Taylor-Abrams Criteria, and Vienna Research Criteria). For the other diagnoses (Research Diagnostic Criteria, DSM-III, Michigan Discriminant Index, and Hamilton Endogenomorphy Index), no significant association was found. The RDC criterion 'early or intermittent awakening' was the only one out of 28 diagnostic criteria tested which was significantly associated with DST nonsuppression.",,Remaining,0,0
634,18367428,Epileptic disorders : international epilepsy journal with videotape,Long-term cognitive and behavioural follow-up in three patients with eye closure-triggered paroxysmal activity.,"To study clinical, EEG, neuropsychological and behavioural evolution of three patients presenting with epileptic activity triggered by eye closure (EC) over a mean 10-year follow-up period.	All patients were studied at the time of the first observation (T0) and after a long follow-up period (T1). At both T0 and T1, each patient underwent: 1) traditional and specific activation techniques during prolonged video-EEG monitoring to detect possible inducing factors; 2) neuropsychological evaluations during video-EEG monitoring either with eyes closed or eyes open to detect any transient cognitive impairment (TCI); 3) detailed neuropsychological assessment without simultaneous EEG recording, to detect any stable cognitive impairment (SCI).	EEG recordings showed transient, generalized paroxysms in one case and a continuous epileptic activity triggered by eye closure in the other two cases, at both T0 and T1. In all patients, no particular epileptiform discharge-induced factors were identified except for eye blinking (spontaneous, voluntary or induced by corneal reflex). The results of neuropsychological assessment while eyes were closed as compared to performances with eyes open, showed no significant differences at T0 or at T1 in two cases, thus possibly indicating the absence of TCI. Wechsler Intelligence Scales showed a decrease in performance at T1 in the two patients with eye closure-induced, continuous epileptiform activity. Detailed neuropsychological assessment without EEG recordings demonstrated an impairment of facial recognition ability in all three patients at T1.	The lack of any differences between the results of neuropsychological tests performed with eyes open and eyes closed in two patients might suggest that not all eye-closure-triggered paroxysms are associated with TCI. On the other hand, our data highlight that EC-triggered, EEG epileptic discharges can produce long-lasting neuropsychological and behavioural effects, and also indicate that EEG discharges recurring over time might exert a disruptive effect on cognitive functions. Our three patients showed extreme variability across the neuropsychological tasks except for a facial recognition deficit that was evident in all cases, thus suggesting a possible dysfunction of temporo-occipital brain structures and/or of the fusiform face area as recently demonstrated by combined fMRI/EEG studies in patients with fixation-off sensitivity.",,Remaining,0,0

The prevalence of Internet addiction in children with recurrent headache was lower than that found in their peers in Turkey, possibly due to avoidance of computer use as a headache trigger. This finding raises the question of whether migraine- or tension-type headaches actually prevent Internet addiction.",Child| headache| Internet addiction| migraine| prevalence,Remaining,0,0

The clinic sample included 181 children (ages 3 to 8) and their mothers and fathers who were participating in a parenting treatment study for children with behavioral problems. Mother-father agreement for ratings of internalizing problems was found to be moderate and consistent with previous research. Regression analyses revealed that parental stress, but not depression, predicted some of the variance associated with mother-father rating discrepancies. A gender effect was also found such that parent discrepancies were larger for girls than for boys. Much of the variance associated with rating discrepancies was left unexplained.

637,24225435,The Israel journal of psychiatry and related sciences,Elaboration on posttraumatic stress disorder diagnostic criteria: a factor analytic study of PTSD exposure to war or terror.,"In societies facing prolonged exposure to war and terror, empirical research provides mixed support for the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptom clusters groupings identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR) as re-experiencing the event, avoidance and emotional numbing, and hyperarousal.	This study examines the validity of the PTSD symptom clusters in elements of Israeli society exposed to man-made trauma. Survivors (N=2,198) of seven different war and terror-related traumas were assessed using a DSM-IV-TR based PTSD inventory. Four confirmatory factor analytic models were compared.	The most acceptable model was a correlated model consisting of four factors of re-experiencing, avoidance, emotional numbing, and hyperarousal. DSM-IV-TR avoidance empirically split into active avoidance and emotional numbing. These results corroborate knowledge and suggest that in Israel, where stressors are ongoing, the PTSD symptom clusters may be reformulated in DSM-5 to consist of re-experiencing, active avoidance, emotional numbing and hyperarousal.",,Remaining,0,0

We investigated the association between hyperfibrinogenemia upon hospital admission and the short-term prognosis of AIS patients.	A total of 3,212 AIS patients enrolled from December 2013 to May 2014 across 22 hospitals in Suzhou city were included in the present study. Hyperfibrinogenemia was defined as having a serum fibrinogen＞4.0g/L. Cox proportional hazard and logistic regression models were used to estimate the effect of hyperfibrinogenemia on all-cause in-hospital mortality and poor discharge outcome (modified Rankin Scale score≥3) in AIS patients.	During hospitalization, 106 patients (3.3%) died from all-cause and 1226 (38.2%) patients experienced poor functional outcome at discharge. Multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, white blood cell count and other covariates, showed that hyperfibrinogenemia was associated with a 1.76-fold increase in the risk of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.81; P-value=0.019). However, there was no significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and poor outcome at discharge (adjusted odds ratios[OR]1.15; 95% CI 0.86-1.53; P-value=0.338). Sensitivity and subgroup analyses also confirmed a significant association between hyperfibrinogenemia and in-hospital mortality.

640,16955437,International journal of geriatric psychiatry,Abnormal neurotransmitter metabolite levels in Alzheimer patients with a delirium.,"Delirium is a complex neuropsychiatric syndrome with an acute onset and fluctuating course. Several studies have suggested the presence of disturbed cholinergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic pathways in delirium as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Abnormal concentrations of amino acids and of neurotransmitter metabolites have been found in plasma, platelets and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients, and in plasma and CSF of patients with a delirium. The aim of this study was to investigate amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels in plasma of AD patients with a concurrent delirium.	In a case-control study of patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD) with concurrent delirium, we investigated the contribution of delirium to some biochemical parameters in blood. We compared plasma amino acid and neurotransmitter metabolite levels of 17 delirious AD patients with those of 17 age- and gender-matched non-delirious AD patients and 29 age- and gender-matched controls.	Homovanillic acid (HVA) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) levels were higher in delirious AD patients than in controls, but only HVA concentrations were higher in delirious AD patients than in non-delirious AD patients.	Our findings suggest that central dopaminergic and serotonergic turnover are increased in AD patients with delirium and that the high dopaminergic turnover might reflect the consequences of delirium.",,Remaining,0,0

For each MS patient, we selected five controls using density sampling from the entire Danish population, matching controls to children with MS by sex and birthdate. We analyzed data as a nested case-control study with psychiatric morbidity as exposure and MS as outcome, and a matched cohort study with MS as exposure and psychiatric co-morbidity as outcome. Hazard ratios (HR) including 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using Cox regression.	We identified 212 children with MS and 1060 controls. No association between psychiatric morbidity and the rate of MS was found before MS onset.

One factor that is generally assumed to be an important indicator of quality of care is the opportunity for community contact that users of a residential service have. This is illustrated by its inclusion in most instruments designed to assess quality of care in psychiatric services. The present study set out to examine the amount of community contact made by residents of three units of a London psychiatric rehabilitation service. Level of community contact was indeed found to be unrelated to the location of these facilities on a hospital site or in the community.

646,21410485,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Hispanic Americans Baseline Alcohol Survey (HABLAS): is the 'prevention paradox' applicable to alcohol problems across Hispanic national groups?,"The 'prevention paradox,' a notion that most alcohol-related problems are generated by nonheavy drinkers, has significant relevance to public health policy and prevention efforts. The extent of the paradox has driven debate over the type of balance that should be struck between alcohol policies targeting a select group of high-risk drinkers versus more global approaches that target the population at-large. This paper examines the notion that most alcohol problems among 4 Hispanic national groups in the United States are attributable to moderate drinkers.	A general population survey employing a multistage cluster sample design, with face-to-face interviews in respondents' homes was conducted in 5 metropolitan areas of the United States. Study participants included a total of 2,773 current drinkers 18 years and older. Alcohol consumed in the past year (bottom 90% vs. top 10%), binge drinking (binge vs. no binge), and a 4-way grouping defined by volume and binge criteria were used. Alcohol-related harms included 14 social and dependence problems.	Drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for 56 to 73% of all social problems, and for 55 to 73% of all dependence-related problems reported, depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers are responsible for the majority of the social problems (53 to 75%) and dependence-related problems (59 to 73%), also depending on Hispanic national group. Binge drinkers at the bottom 90% of the distribution are responsible for a larger proportion of all social and dependence-related problems reported than those at the top 10% of the volume distribution. Cuban Americans are an exception.	The prevention paradox holds when using volume-based risk groupings and disappears when using a binge-drinking risk grouping. Binge drinkers who drink moderately on an average account for more harms than those who drink heavily across all groups, with exception of Cuban Americans.",,Remaining,0,0

We examined the association between this knowledge and event rate.	We studied 174 anticoagulated patients with AF aged 69±10.7 years (median CHA2DS2 -VASc 4). Knowledge was assessed at baseline using the Jessa AF Knowledge Questionnaire (JAKQ). The primary endpoint was a composite of ischemic cerebrovascular events, major or non-major clinically relevant bleeding, and death, recorded during a median follow-up of 42 months.	The primary endpoint occurred in 48 (27.5%) patients (10.5 per 100 patient-years) including 12 ischemic cerebrovascular events (2.2 per 100 patient-years) and 29 bleeding episodes (5.8 per 100 patient- years). Lower baseline JAKQ scores were associated with the primary outcome (p=0.007), solely when patients who bled during follow-up were compared with the remainder (p=0.007). Patients who were aware of the importance of a regular anticoagulant intake despite the absence of AF symptoms, had, however, a lower risk of cerebrovascular events (p<0.0001). The subjects who experienced bleeding or the primary endpoint were less likely to understand the essence of AF (p=0.03), to know safe painkillers used in combination with OAC (p<0.001), and what to do when the anticoagulant was forgotten (p=0.02).

The current study documented the prevalence of driving after alcohol and marijuana use in the past 2 weeks as well as the prevalence of riding with a driver who had used each substance during that time frame. We tested whether young adults who lived with family members (i.e., their parents or their children) were less likely to engage in these behaviors. Methods: Participants aged 18-25 who resided in nonmetropolitan areas in the United States (N = 1,131; 55% female, Mage = 22.6) completed an online survey. Multivariate logistic regressions examined alcohol- and marijuana-related driving and riding behaviors adjusting for demographic factors. Interactions tested whether associations varied by gender. Results: In the 2 weeks prior to the survey, 17% of participants drove after drinking alcohol and 21% had ridden with a driver who had been drinking. The prevalence of driving after marijuana use was 11%, and 16% of the sample had ridden with a driver who had been using marijuana. Participants who lived with their parents were less likely to ride with a driver who had been using alcohol or marijuana (adjusted odds ratios [AORs] = 0.71 and 0.55, respectively). Living with parents was also associated negatively with driving after both substances, but these associations were no longer significant when controlling for substance use frequency and driving frequency. Surprisingly, the odds of driving after marijuana use were over 2 times larger for young adults who lived with their children. For women, but not men, residing with children decreased the odds of driving and riding after alcohol use. Conclusions: Living with parents protects against riding after substance use among young adults. Prevention programs should target young adults who live independently or those transitioning away from the parental home. Furthermore, given the higher rates of driving after marijuana use among young adult parents, this group should be educated about the risks associated with this behavior.",Rural populations| adolescent| alcohol| driving under the influence| marijuana| young adults,Remaining,0,0

Although recent animal studies have tried to clarify the neural substrates of the MMN, the nature of schizophrenia-related deficits is unknown. In this study, we applied a novel paradigm developed from translational animal model studies to carefully deconstruct the constituent neurophysiological processes underlying MMN generation. Patients with schizophrenia (N = 25) and healthy comparison subjects (HCS; N = 27) underwent MMN testing using both a conventional auditory oddball paradigm and a 'many-standards paradigm' that was specifically developed to deconstruct the subcomponent adaptation and deviance detection processes that are presumed to underlie the MMN. Using a conventional oddball paradigm, patients with schizophrenia exhibited large effect size deficits of both duration and frequency MMN, consistent with many previous studies. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia showed selective impairments in deviance detection but no impairment in adaptation to repeated tones. These findings support the use of the many-standards paradigm for deconstructing the constituent processes underlying the MMN, with implications for the use of these translational measures to accelerate the development of new treatments that target perceptual and cognitive impairments in schizophrenia and related disorders.",adaptation| deviance detection| mismatch negativity (MMN)| schizophrenia| translatable physiological biomarker,Remaining,0,0

The accuracy of carotid duplex scan in assessing stroke risk reflects the experience of the scan reader. Thus, methods that can enhance ultrasonic evaluation of plaque morphology might allow a more objective means of determining carotid-mediated stroke risk.	We performed densitometric analysis of B-mode images of carotid plaques in nine patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. All patients had preoperative duplex color imaging and cerebral arteriography. The surgical specimen was analyzed histologically to determine the plaque components (soft plaque/organized thrombus, intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, fibrosis, and calcification). The specimen findings were correlated with the densitometric measurements to determine whether the density analysis would allow a reliable determination of the plaque substratum.	With 1.0 as a reference point for the moving column of blood, the mean acoustic densities (+/-SD) were as follows: organized thrombus, 1.8 +/- 0.5; intraplaque hemorrhage/lipid deposition, 5.15 +/- 0.9; fibrosis, 9.51 +/- 2.9; and calcification, 15.5 +/- 8.6.

The objective of the current report is to determine if the latent class structure of ADHD subtypes can be replicated in a culturally distinct sample of female and male Australian twins.	LCA was applied to parent-report DSM-IV ADHD symptom profiles of N=2,848 child and adolescent Australian twins and compared to North American findings. Separate models were fitted for females (N= 1,432) and males (N= 1,416).	The most congruent latent ADHD classes across samples included a non-symptomatic class, three mild-moderate and two severe classes. Also present within samples was a rare hyperactive-impulsive class and a unique class, the structure of which was idiosyncratic across samples. Mean symptom endorsement and individual symptom endorsement probabilities for each of the stable classes were similar across samples. Consistent with previous findings, there was substantial overlap between the DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes with the severe inattentive and severe combined latent classes. However, DSM-IV inattentive and combined subtypes were distributed over several latent classes in each sample, and a substantial proportion of individuals with no DSM-IV diagnosis were also assigned to these severe classes.	Results from LCA using an Australian twin sample replicate six of the eight latent class subtypes previously reported using Missouri female twins and extend the findings to male twins.

After a period of monitoring, evaluation, and screening, growth hormone stimulation testing is considered when the diagnosis of growth hormone deficiency (GHD) is entertained. Though flawed, growth hormone stimulation tests remain part of the comprehensive evaluation of growth and are essential for the diagnosis of growth hormone (GH) deficiency. Variables including testing length, growth hormone assay and diagnostic cut off affect results. Beyond the intrinsic issues of testing, results of GH stimulation testing can be influenced by patient characteristics. Various factors including age, gender, puberty, nutritional status and body weight modulate the secretion of GH.",IGF – I| growth hormone deficiency| growth hormone – secretion| sex hormone priming| short stature,Remaining,0,0

We analyzed data using repeated measurement models. Social integration, family ties, and engagement with family were associated with cognitive function at advanced ages, controlling for education and introducing depressive symptoms, functional limitations, and chronic conditions as intervening variables. Association of social integration, through participation in community activities, with change in cognitive decline was more significant at advanced ages. Having friends was significantly associated with change in cognitive function in women only. Our findings have important implications for clinical medicine and public health because associations of social relations with cognitive function suggests that they may help to maintain cognitive function in old age.",,Remaining,0,0
662,17967187,BMC cardiovascular disorders,Aminotransferases are associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in rheumatoid arthritis.,"Serum aminotransferase concentrations are reportedly strongly associated with insulin resistance, an established cardiovascular risk factor that is not routinely assessed in clinical practice. We therefore explored the possibility that serum aminotransferase concentrations are as closely related to large artery disease as insulin resistance in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).	Carotid artery plaque (ultrasonography), insulin resistance and liver enzymes (prior to methotrexate (MTX) were determined in 77 consecutive patients with RA (43 with and 34 without MTX).	Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were associated with insulin resistance in univariate analysis (R = 0.54, p < 0.0001 and R = 0.36, p = 0.001, respectively) and after adjustment for age, gender and waist circumference (partial R = 0.43, p = 0.0001 and partial R = 0.37, p = 0.001, respectively). ALT and AST concentrations were higher in patients with plaque as compared to in those without plaque (ALT (u/l): 27 2223242526272829303132 versus 20 181920212223, p = 0.02; AST (u/l): 25 2122232425262728 versus 20 19202122, p = 0.02). The odds ratios [95% CI] for plaque were 1.92 [1.14-3.24] (p = 0.01), 1.93 [1.17-3.16] (p = 0.009) and 1.82 [1.13-2.93] (p = 0.01) for 1 SD increase in ALT (~10 u/l) and AST (approximately 6 u/l) concentrations and in logarithmically transformed homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (~0.2 uU.mmol/ml.l), respectively. After adjustment for the potentially confounding characteristics of age, sex, hypertension and hypothyroidism in logistic regression models, ALT (p = 0.049) and AST concentrations (p = 0.027) remained associated with plaque whereas the HOMA-IR did not (p = 0.08). AST concentrations (p = 0.049) were associated with plaque independent of insulin resistance whereas the HOMA-IR (p = 0.1) was not associated with plaque independent of AST concentrations.	Within currently recommended reference ranges, serum aminotransferase concentrations may be strongly associated with insulin resistance and atherosclerosis in patients with RA. The measurement of aminotransferase concentrations could be a useful tool in cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with RA.",,Remaining,0,0
663,37767072,F1000Research,EncephalApp Stroop Test for covert hepatic encephalopathy screening in Tunisian cirrhotic patients.,"Background: Covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) is underdiagnosed and is difficult to detect. The EncephalApp Stroop test is validated for its screening. The aim of the study was to define Tunisian norms for the test based on healthy controls norms and to estimate the prevalence of CHE in cirrhotic Tunisian patients. Methods: A prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional study was conducted. Ambulatory or hospitalized cirrhotic patients aged 40 years and over were recruited at 11 centers. Healthy subjects aged 40 years and over were recruited at 8 centers. We used a translated Arabic version of the streamlined EncephalApp Stroop test. The task has two components: 'Off' and 'On' state depending on the discordance or concordance of the stimuli. Results: 142 patients were included. The mean age was 57.26 years [40-86]. 40 (28.17%) of cirrhotic patients who were included were diagnosed as having a minimal hepatic encephalopathy or CHE. Among the ineligible patients, 22 had overt hepatic encephalopathy. If we consider these patients, the overall prevalence rate of CHE was around 24.39% in cirrhotic patients. It was more frequent in women (34.21% vs 25.96%), and in patients whose level of school education is between 6 and 13 years. Its prevalence does not appear to be affected by gender, MELD score, etiology of cirrhosis and age group of patients, as these variables were independent with respective p according to the chi-square test 0.413; 0.736; 0.663 and 0.1. The stroop times (On / Off and On + Off) correlated significantly with each other, are associated significantly and positively with age (respective Pearson coefficients: 0.578; 0.567 and 0.6). The more the age increases, the more the stroop response times increases (p > 10 [-3]). Conclusions: EncephalApp Stroop test was an efficient screening tool for CHE in Tunisian cirrhotic patients.",Cirrhosis| Medical apps| Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy| Tool| West Haven Criteria,Remaining,0,0
664,37154884,Brain topography,Cortical and Subcortical Changes in MEG Activity Reflect Parkinson's Progression over a Period of 7 Years.,"In this study of early functional changes in Parkinson's disease (PD), we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the development of changes in both cortical and subcortical neurophysiological brain activity, including their association with clinical measures of disease severity. Repeated resting-state MEG recordings and clinical assessments were obtained in the context of a unique longitudinal cohort study over a seven-year period using a multiple longitudinal design. We used linear mixed-models to analyze the relationship between neurophysiological (spectral power and functional connectivity) and clinical data. At baseline, early-stage (drug-naïve) PD patients demonstrated spectral slowing compared to healthy controls in both subcortical and cortical brain regions, most outspoken in the latter. Over time, spectral slowing progressed in strong association with clinical measures of disease progression (cognitive and motor). Global functional connectivity was not different between groups at baseline and hardly changed over time. Therefore, investigation of associations with clinical measures of disease progression were not deemed useful. An analysis of individual connections demonstrated differences between groups at baseline (higher frontal theta, lower parieto-occipital alpha2 band functional connectivity) and over time in PD patients (increase in frontal delta and theta band functional connectivity). Our results suggest that spectral measures are promising candidates in the search for non-invasive markers of both early-stage PD and of the ongoing disease process.",Biomarker| Longitudinal| Magnetoencephalography| Resting-state| Spectral power| Subcortical brain regions,Remaining,0,0

The association between food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors has been established but not in this population. To investigate this association, we recruited 110 recently released prisoners to participate in a survey. Ninety-one percent of our sample was food insecure; 37% did not eat for an entire day in the past month. Those who did not eat for an entire day were more likely to report using alcohol, heroin, or cocaine before sex or exchanging sex for money compared to those who had at least a meal each day. From this pilot study, released prisoners appear to be at risk for food insecurity, and not eating for an entire day is associated with certain HIV risk behaviors. HIV prevention efforts should include longitudinal studies on the relationship between food insecurity and HIV risk behaviors among recently released prisoners.",,Remaining,0,0

This observational study of 1507 depressed adults examined baseline screens for hazardous drinking (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test score ≥ 8), severe anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item score ≥ 15) and bipolar disorder [Mood Disorders Questionnaire (MDQ) positive screen]; 6-month depression remission; primary care, psychiatric, emergency department (ED) and inpatient visits 1 year postbaseline; and multiple covariates. Analyses included logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression.	At unadjusted baseline, 60.7% had no positive screens beyond depression, 31.5% had one (mostly severe anxiety), 6.6% had two and 1.2% had all three. In multivariate models, positive screens reduced odds of remission versus no positive screens [e.g., one screen odds ratio (OR) = 0.608, p = .000; all three OR = 0.152, p = .018]. Screening positive for severe anxiety predicted more postbaseline visits of all types; severe anxiety plus hazardous drinking predicted greater primary care, ED and inpatient; severe anxiety plus MDQ and the combination of all three positive screens both predicted greater psychiatric visits (all p < .05). Regression-adjusted utilization patterns varied across combinations of positive screens.	Positive screens predicted lower remission. Severe anxiety and its combinations with other positive screens were common and generally predicted greater utilization.

Their mean age was 55 years. Only two patients suffered a (non-disabling) stroke, but eight patients had a major cardiac event: fatal myocardial infarction in three, sudden death in one and non-fatal myocardial infarction in four patients. Seven of these eight patients were known to have cardiovascular risk factors. Visual symptoms were relatively benign with regard to cardiac events (2 events in 28 patients), whereas dizziness alone and focal sensory symptoms alone were more strongly associated with subsequent cardiac complications (2 out of 4, and 4 out of 13 patients, respectively). In a control group of 185 patients with 'typical' TIAs or minor strokes, followed for a total of 233 patient years, seven patients had a ischaemic stroke, and only one a cardiac event.

The experimental paradigm employed was the use of electroencephalography to measure the detection of semantic incongruity within written sentences, as indexed by an N400 event-related potential. Whilst the seven controls appropriately demonstrated N400 potentials only to semantically incongruent stimuli, the seven participants with AS inappropriately demonstrated N400 potentials to congruent stimuli.

670,9292187,Brain and cognition,The decoding of emotional concepts in patients with focal cerebral lesions.,"The effects of focal brain lesions on the decoding of emotional concepts in facial expressions were investigated. Facial emotions are hierarchically organized patterns comprising (1) structural surface features, (2) discrete (primary) emotional categories and (3) secondary dimensions, such as valence and arousal. Categorical decoding was measured using (1) selection of category labels and selection of the named emotion category; (2) matching one facial expression with two choice expressions. Dimensional decoding was assessed by matching one face with two different expressions with regard to valence or arousal. 70 patients with well documented cerebral lesions and 15 matched hospital controls participated in the study. 27 had left brain damage (LBD; 10 frontal, 10 temporal, 7 parietal); 37 had right brain damage (RBD; 15 frontal, 11 temporal, 11 parietal). Six additional patients had lesions involving both frontal lobes. Right temporal and parietal lesioned patients were markedly impaired in the decoding of primary emotions. The same patients also showed a reduced arousal decoding. In contrast to several patients with frontal and left hemisphere lesions, emotional conceptualization and face discrimination was not independent in these groups. No group differences were observed in valence decoding. However, right frontal lesions appeared to interfere with the discrimination of negative valence. Moreover, a distraction by structural features was noted in RBD when facial identities were varied across stimulus and response pictures in matching tasks with differing conceptual load. Our results suggest that focal brain lesions differentially affect the comprehension of emotional meaning in faces depending on the level of conceptual load and interference of structural surface features.",,Remaining,0,0

672,16226047,Journal of clinical forensic medicine,Near miss incidents in police custody suites in London in 2003: a feasibility study.,"Potentially preventable deaths in police custody include those which involve illicit drugs, alcohol and deliberate self-harm. Near miss incidents (NMI) that did not result in death have a crucial role in understanding risk factors in custody. Such research has not previously been undertaken. A program of research has been developed to study NMI, in order to better identify those at risk in police custody. For the purposes of this research, NMI have been defined as 'an unplanned and unforeseeable or unforeseen event that could have resulted, but did not result, in human death or may have resulted in injury or other adverse outcomes'. It was intended that the definition although broad, would not include simple accidents (e.g. slipping on urine in a cell) or trivial injury.	The two aims of the study are (a) to determine whether it is realistic to attempt to assess NMI with the intention of identifying information of use in enhancing detainee care and (b) to assess how frequently NMIs occur and whether there are specific patterns. Pilot interviews were conducted with three forensic physicians practising in London, UK to create a structured questionnaire for all forensic physicians working in London. The questionnaire provided the basis of a retrospective recall survey of all forensic physicians working in London as Forensic Medical Examiners. The questionnaire was designed to assess the numbers of NMI, patterns in occurrence and relevant learning points within the previous 6 months. A covering letter, background questionnaire (exploring the background of the medical practitioner), copies of the survey, and reply paid envelopes were sent to each Forensic Medical Examiner (n=134) in London, contracted to provide forensic medical services for the Metropolitan Police Service. Data about all incidents were anonymized.	Ninety six (73%) Forensic Medical Examiners responded. Of these 18% were Principal grade, the remainder were Senior (24%), Standard (35%) and Assistant (23%). Thirty eight NMI were reported by 27 Forensic Medical Examiners (of all levels). The initial reason for police contact was recorded as alcohol (n=8), theft and robbery (n=7), warrants (n=4), violence (n=3), traffic violations (n=2) and single cases of drugs, murder and immigration offences. Of the main perceived cause of each NMI, illicit drugs were involved in 12/38, alcohol in 17/38, deliberate self-harm in 11/38, issues concerning searches, checks or rousing in 8/38, failure of inter-agency communications in 5/38, and possible resource issues in 4/38. In a number of cases more than one factor was involved.	The information established about NMI is broadly consistent with documented patterns of deaths in police custody in England and Wales which supports the validity of the data. The next stage of this research will be a prospective six month study in which NMI will be analysed in order to learn lessons which may be utilised to attempt to prevent potentially avoidable deaths in police custody.",,Remaining,0,0

We used Growth Curve Analysis to test whether movement patterns were predictable by expression type and participant group.

Seventeen patients with 21 carotid artery plaques received examinations with CEUS. According to the nature of the plaques, the patients were divided into soft and mixed plaque group and hard and calcified plaque group. The maximal enhancement intensity of the plaques (I(MAX)) and maximal plaque density (D(MAX)) were measured to quantify the neovasculature. The patients also underwent concurrent ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT, and ¹⁸F-FDG uptake was quantified by the mean standard uptake values (SUV(mean)), an index reflecting the inflammatory activity in the plaque. The findings in CEUS and PET/CT were comparatively analyzed for these cases.	The D(MAX) of the plaque in soft and mixed plaque group was significantly greater than that in hard and calcified plaque group (4.26±3.65 vs 1.41±1.47, P<0.05); the I(MAX) was also greater in the former group, but this difference was not statistically significant (26.83±19.61 vs 24.73±29.85, P=0.869). The soft and mixed plaques tended to have higher SUVmean than the hard and calcified plaques (1.70±0.45 vs 1.47±0.12, P=0.099). The values of I(MAX) and D(MAX) were not found to correlate to SUV(mean) in these patients.	CEUS can sensitively show the status of neovascularization within the carotid atherosclerosis plaques, and PET/CT reflects the inflammatory activity in the plaques. The combination of these two imaging modalities allows the evaluation of plaque stability in terms of neoangiogenesis and inflammatory activity.",,Remaining,0,0

We have found the phospholipid, phosphatidylserine (PS) to be a highly specific inhibitor of MAO-B, which has led us to postulate that the PS-MAO interaction might offer a basis for the lower MAO levels observed in platelets from certain schizophrenic populations. In this study we compared platelet MAO activity with phospholipid composition in a group of normals and chronic paranoid schizophrenics. The phospholipids in platelets and erythrocytes were extracted and separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into major classes phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol and PS. The paranoid subjects showed statistically significantly lower MAO activity as well as higher mean levels of PS and lower levels of PC in both platelets and erythrocytes, consistent with our hypothesis.

Results showed that chronic cannabis smokers' performance on the CTT (p<0.001) and the DAT (p<0.001) was impaired during baseline relative to the comparison group. Psychomotor performance in the chronic cannabis smokers improved over 3 weeks of abstinence, but did not recover to equivalent control group performance.	Sustained cannabis abstinence moderately improved critical tracking and divided attention performance in chronic, daily cannabis smokers, but impairment was still observable compared to controls after 3 weeks of abstinence.

679,22428580,Journal of neurochemistry,Parkinson's disease-associated DJ-1 mutations impair mitochondrial dynamics and cause mitochondrial dysfunction.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction represents a critical event during the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD) and expanding evidences demonstrate that an altered balance in mitochondrial fission/fusion is likely an important mechanism leading to mitochondrial and neuronal dysfunction/degeneration. In this study, we investigated whether DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics and function in neuronal cells. Confocal and electron microscopic analysis demonstrated that M17 human neuroblastoma cells over-expressing wild-type DJ-1 (WT DJ-1 cells) displayed elongated mitochondria while M17 cells over-expressing PD-associated DJ-1 mutants (R98Q, D149A and L166P) (mutant DJ-1 cells) showed significant increase of fragmented mitochondria. Similar mitochondrial fragmentation was also noted in primary hippocampal neurons over-expressing PD-associated mutant forms of DJ-1. Functional analysis revealed that over-expression of PD-associated DJ-1 mutants resulted in mitochondria dysfunction and increased neuronal vulnerability to oxidative stress (H(2) O(2)) or neurotoxin. Further immunoblot studies demonstrated that levels of dynamin-like protein (DLP1), also known as Drp1, a regulator of mitochondrial fission, was significantly decreased in WT DJ-1 cells but increased in mutant DJ-1 cells. Importantly, DLP1 knockdown in these mutant DJ-1 cells rescued the abnormal mitochondria morphology and all associated mitochondria/neuronal dysfunction. Taken together, these studies suggest that DJ-1 is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial dynamics through modulation of DLP1 expression and PD-associated DJ-1 mutations may cause PD by impairing mitochondrial dynamics and function.",,Remaining,0,0

The accuracy of indirect BP measurement is strongly influenced by the position of both patient and arm during the measurement. Acute stroke patients are often nursed in lateral decubitus positions. The effect of these alternating body positions in relation to affected body side on the outcome and reliability of BP readings in acute stroke patients is unknown.	An automatic oscillometric BP device was used. BP was measured in both arms in the (back) supine and both lateral decubitus positions.	In total, 54 consecutive acute stroke patients were included. Thirty-five patients had right-sided deficits and 19 patients had left-sided deficits. Supine BP readings were similar in the right and left arms regardless of side of deficit. Measurements of BP in the lateral decubitus positions resulted in significantly lower BP readings in the uppermost arm (around 12 mm Hg in both arms) and significantly higher readings in the right lowermost arm (around 6 mm Hg) compared to the supine position. This effect seemed less pronounced when the left lowermost arm was measured. There was no relation between change of BP readings in various lateral positions and side of stroke.	Alternating lateral decubitus positions according to nursing standards in acute stroke patients lead to a mean 18 mm Hg BP fluctuation. This may largely be explained by hydrostatic pressure effects, partly by anatomic factors in the left lowermost arm, but not by the side of stroke.",,Remaining,0,0

684,32012170,PLoS medicine,Association of coincident self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake with all-cause and cardiovascular disease mortality: A Norwegian pooled population analysis.,"The disease burden attributable to mental health problems and to excess or harmful alcohol use is considerable. Despite a strong relationship between these 2 important factors in population health, there are few studies quantifying the mortality risk associated with their co-occurrence in the general population. The aim of this study was therefore to investigate cardiovascular disease (CVD) and all-cause mortality according to self-reported mental health problems and alcohol intake in the general population.	We followed 243,372 participants in Norwegian health surveys (1994-2002) through 2014 for all-cause and CVD mortality by data linkage to national registries. The mean (SD) age at the time of participation in the survey was 43.9 (10.6) years, and 47.8% were men. During a mean (SD) follow-up period of 16.7 (3.2) years, 6,587 participants died from CVD, and 21,376 died from all causes. Cox models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs according to a mental health index (low, 1.00-1.50; high, 2.01-4.00; low score is favourable) based on the General Health Questionnaire and the Hopkins Symptom Checklist, and according to self-reported alcohol intake (low, <2; light, 2-11.99; moderate, 12-23.99; high, ≥24 grams/day). HRs were adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and CVD risk factors. Compared to a reference group with low mental health index score and low alcohol intake, HRs (95% CIs) for all-cause mortality were 0.93 (0.89, 0.97; p = 0.001), 1.00 (0.92, 1.09; p = 0.926), and 1.14 (0.96, 1.35; p = 0.119) for low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs (95% CIs) were 1.22 (1.14, 1.31; p < 0.001), 1.24 (1.15, 1.33; p < 0.001), 1.43 (1.23, 1.66; p < 0.001), and 2.29 (1.87, 2.80; p < 0.001) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. For CVD mortality, HRs (95% CIs) were 0.93 (0.86, 1.00; p = 0.058), 0.90 (0.76, 1.07; p = 0.225), and 0.95 (0.67, 1.33; p = 0.760) for a low index score combined with light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively, and 1.11 (0.98, 1.25; p = 0.102), 0.97 (0.83, 1.13; p = 0.689), 1.01 (0.71, 1.44; p = 0.956), and 1.78 (1.14, 2.78; p = 0.011) for high index score combined with low, light, moderate, and high alcohol intake, respectively. HRs for the combination of a high index score and high alcohol intake (HRs: 2.29 for all-cause and 1.78 for CVD mortality) were 64% (95% CI 53%, 74%; p < 0.001) and 69% (95% CI 42%, 97%; p < 0.001) higher than expected for all-cause mortality and CVD mortality, respectively, under the assumption of a multiplicative interaction structure. A limitation of our study is that the findings were based on average reported intake of alcohol without accounting for the drinking pattern.	In the general population, the mortality rates associated with more mental health problems and a high alcohol intake were increased when the risk factors occurred together.",,Remaining,0,0
685,31264559,The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene,Diagnostic Usefulness of Cytokine and Chemokine Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid of Patients with Suspected Tuberculous Meningitis.,"In this study, we investigated the diagnostic utility of the cytokine profile of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assays of patients with suspected tuberculous meningitis (TBM). We prospectively enrolled adult patients with suspected TBM, and CSF specimens were analyzed for 18 cytokines/chemokines and soluble programmed death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Enzyme-linked immunospot assays were performed on mononuclear cells from the CSF (CSF-MCs) and peripheral blood (PBMCs). A total of 87 patients with meningitis, including 42 TBM-suspected patients and 45 non-TBM patients, were enrolled. Excluding the 32 patients with possible TBM, 10 patients with TBM and 45 patients with non-TBM were finally analyzed. Levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA), interleukin 12 subunit β (IL-12p40), IL-13, macrophage inflammatory protein α (MIP-1α), and soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 in the CSF were significantly higher in the TBM group than in the non-TBM group (P < 0.05). The optimal cutoff values for the sensitivities and specificities of the test methods for diagnosing TBM with small samples of 10 cases of definite or probable TBM were as follows: ADA > 6.95 U/L, 70% and 81%; IL-12p40 > 52.04 pg/mL, 80% and 73%; IL-13 > 0.44 pg/mL, 90% and 47%; MIP-1α > 8.83 pg/mL, 80% and 62%; soluble PD-1 > 35.87 pg/mL, 80% and 63%; soluble PD-L1 > 24.19 pg/mL, 80% and 61%; CSF-MC ELISPOT > 13.5 spots/250,000 CSF-MC, 30% and 91%; and PBMC ELISPOT > 14 spots/250,000 PBMCs, 50% and 78%, respectively. Therefore, CSF IL-12p40, IL-13, MIP-1α, and soluble PD-1 and PD-L1 concentrations appear to be useful adjuncts for diagnosing TBM.",,Remaining,0,0
686,30831339,Addictive behaviors,A cross sectional survey of smoking characteristics and quitting behaviour from a sample of homeless adults in Great Britain.,"Smoking is a key contributor to health and social inequalities and homeless smoking prevalence rates are 4 times higher than the general population. Research on homelessness and smoking to date has been concentrated predominantly in the US and Australia. This study aimed to describe smoking and quitting behaviour in homeless adult smokers in Great Britain. Data on perceptions of, and willingness to try, e-cigarettes were also gathered.	Cross sectional survey of 283 adult smokers accessing homeless support services in Kent, the Midlands, London and Edinburgh. Participants answered a four-part survey: i) demographics; ii) current smoking behaviour and dependence (including the Fagerström Test of Cigarette Dependence [FTCD]); iii) previous quit attempts; and iv) e-cigarettes perceptions.	High levels of cigarette dependence were observed (FTCD: M = 7.78, sd ± 0.98). Although desire to quit was high, most had made fewer than 5 quit attempts and 90% of these lasted less than 24 h. 91.5% reported that others around them also smoked. Previous quit methods used included cold turkey (29.7%), NRT (24.7%), varenicline (22.3%) and bupropion (14.5%). 34% were willing or able to spend £20 or more for an e-cigarette and 82% had tried one in the past although 54% reported that they preferred smoking.	We observed high nicotine dependence, few long-term quit attempts, strong desire to quit and amenability to both traditional cessation methods and e-cigarettes. Community embedded and non-routine approaches to cessation may be promising avenues promoting engagement with the homeless community. Likely barriers to uptake include low affordability, preference for cigarettes and high numbers of smoking acquaintances.",E-cigarettes| Homeless| Homelessness| Inequalities| Smoking| Tobacco,Remaining,0,0
687,23888326,Brain imaging and behavior,Structural asymmetries of language-related gray and white matter and their relationship to language function in young children with ASD.,"Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are highly variable in their language abilities, but the neural bases of these individual differences are poorly understood. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography were used to examine asymmetries in language-related gray- and white-matter and their relationships to language ability in a sample of 20 children with ASD, aged 4-7 years, and a reference sample of 20 typically developing (TD) children, aged 6-11 years. Children with ASD did not differ significantly from TD children in gray matter asymmetries, but were significantly less left-lateralized than TD children in the volume and radial diffusivity (RD) of the arcuate fasciculus (AF). They did not differ in the fractional anisotropy (FA) or the mean or axial diffusivity of the AF. Within the ASD group, exploratory analyses revealed that decreased leftward/increased rightward asymmetry of pars opercularis was associated with higher language ability and bilaterally increased FA and decreased RD of the AF. In conclusion, children with ASD exhibited atypical asymmetry in language-related white-matter structure as well as an atypical pattern of brain-language relationships that suggest that they may meet language milestones and acquire normal language via a different neurodevelopmental trajectory from TD children.",,Remaining,0,0
688,31685922,Scientific reports,Blood pressure profile and endothelial function in restless legs syndrome.,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is frequently comorbid with hypertension and cardiovascular diseases; however this relationship and underlying mechanisms remain controversial. After clinical evaluation, 84 drug-free patients with primary RLS (53 women; mean age 55.1 ± 12.3 years) and 76 controls (47 women; mean age 52.2 ± 15.3 years) underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP) and polysomnographic monitoring, and peripheral arterial tonometry to assess endothelial function for 61 patients and 69 controls. Hypertension was diagnosed in 11.9% of patients with RLS based on office measurement, and in 46.4% on the 24 h recording, with nighttime hypertension, two times more frequent than daytime hypertension. Periodic limb movement during sleep (PLMS), markers of sleep fragmentation, and systolic and mean BP non-dipping profile were more frequent among patients. BP non-dipping status was associated with older age, later RLS onset and diagnosis, RLS severity and higher sleep fragmentation. The mean 24-hour, daytime and nighttime BP values, the frequency of hypertension and the endothelial function were comparable between groups. However, both systolic and diastolic BP trajectories over a 24-hour period differed between groups. In conclusion, patients with RLS exhibit a 24-hour BP deregulation with increased frequency of systolic non-dipping profiles that could worsen the risk for CVD morbidity and mortality.",,Remaining,0,0

The aims were to assess presence of PD-MCI in untreated, drug-naive PD patients, and to follow-up the sample over 4 years to ascertain evolution of neurocognitive profile.	Seventy-six patients underwent neuropsychological testing at baseline (T0), and after 2 (T1:n = 62) and 4 years (T2:n = 55). Diagnosis of PD-MCI and PD-associated dementia (PDD) was made according to current consensus criteria.	PD-MCI occurred in 25/76 patients (32.9%) at baseline, and 4 of them reverted from PD-MCI to Normal Cognition (Reverters), 7 remained stable (Non-Reverters) and 2 developed PDD at T2; 12 patients were lost to the follow-up. Among the 51 patients with normal cognition (PD-CN) at T0, 27 had normal cognition at T2 (5 of them were Reverters with respect to diagnosis at T1), 5 had MCI at T1 and T2 (Non-Reverters), 9 had MCI at T2 only, whereas 1 developed PDD; 9 patients were lost to the follow-up. At baseline, Reverters (n = 9) had younger age at onset and better performance on constructional visuospatial task than Non-Reverters (n = 12). Compared to patients without PD-MCI at all evaluations (n = 19), Reverters had poorer performance on verbal immediate recall and attention tasks and higher level of apathy at T0. Reduced performance on the Stroop Test at baseline predicted PD-MCI at T2.	Executive dysfunctions predicted development of PD-MCI after few years from onset.

The beverage-specific effects of ethanol consumption on GGT level and MCV value were analyzed cross-sectionally and retrospectively among middle-aged Japanese men who underwent a retirement health checkup (n = 974).	Both the consumption of distilled alcohol and that of fermented alcohol positively correlated with the logarithm of GGT [standard regression coefficient (beta) 0.261 and 0.174, respectively]. The prevalence rate of elevated GGT levels > or = 70 IU/L) was higher among heavy drinkers of distilled alcohol than among heavy drinkers of fermented alcohol (38.8% vs. 27.6%, p = 0.013). The MCV value correlated with distilled alcohol consumption (beta: 0.212, p < 0.0001) but not with fermented alcohol consumption (beta: 0.043, not significant). The prevalence rate of an elevated MCV (> or = 97 fL) was higher among heavy drinkers of distilled alcohol than among heavy drinkers of fermented alcohol (35.3% vs. 16.8%, p < 0.001).	These results suggest that MCV is less sensitive for detecting heavy consumption of fermented alcohol than for detecting that of distilled alcohol in apparently healthy middle-aged men.",,Remaining,0,0

We performed for the first time a large-scale analysis of sleep duration in children, and how this relates to psychiatric problems including depression, to cognition, and to brain structure. Structural MRI was analyzed in relation to sleep duration, and psychiatric and cognitive measures in 11,067 9-11-year-old children from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study, using a linear mixed model, mediation analysis, and structural equation methods in a longitudinal analysis. Dimensional psychopathology (including depression, anxiety, impulsive behavior) in the children was negatively correlated with sleep duration. Dimensional psychopathology in the parents was also correlated with short sleep duration in their children. The brain areas in which higher volume was correlated with longer sleep duration included the orbitofrontal cortex, prefrontal and temporal cortex, precuneus, and supramarginal gyrus. Longitudinal data analysis showed that the psychiatric problems, especially the depressive problems, were significantly associated with short sleep duration 1 year later. Further, mediation analysis showed that depressive problems significantly mediate the effect of these brain regions on sleep. Higher cognitive scores were associated with higher volume of the prefrontal cortex, temporal cortex, and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Public health implications are that psychopathology in the parents should be considered in relation to sleep problems in children. Moreover, we show that brain structure is associated with sleep problems in children, and that this is related to whether or not the child has depressive problems.",,Remaining,0,0

The direction and angle of rOLD were compared among three groups according to the responsible lesion: lateral medullary (LM), pontine (P), and hemispheric (H).	Sixty-six patients (male, 47; average age, 67 years) were enrolled and divided into the LM (n = 37), P (n = 8), and H (n = 21) groups. All patients had body tilt. Patients in the LM group showed body tilt to the ipsilesional side during hospitalization, while those in the P and H groups tilted to the contralesional side. All patients had rOLD at the final assessment at an average of 13 days after onset; patients in the P and H groups showed contralateral rOLD, while those in the LM group showed ipsilateral rOLD if they did not have cerebellar or pontine lesions. Significant decreases in the angle and changes in direction of rOLD according to lesion site were observed during hospitalization.	Serial changes in rOLD findings after stroke onset are different according to the responsible lesion.

A culture and education fair battery of cognitive tests was developed and validated for population based studies in low- and middle-income countries including India by the 10/66 Dementia Research Group.	We explored the machine learning methods based on the 10/66 battery of cognitive tests for the diagnosis of dementia based in a birth cohort study in South India.	The data sets for 466 men and women for this study were obtained from the on-going Mysore Studies of Natal effect of Health and Ageing (MYNAH), in south India. The data sets included: demographics, performance on the 10/66 cognitive function tests, the 10/66 diagnosis of mental disorders and population based normative data for the 10/66 battery of cognitive function tests. Diagnosis of dementia from the rule based approach was compared against the 10/66 diagnosis of dementia. We have applied machine learning techniques to identify minimal number of the 10/66 cognitive function tests required for diagnosing dementia and derived an algorithm to improve the accuracy of dementia diagnosis.	Of 466 subjects, 27 had 10/66 diagnosis of dementia, 19 of whom were correctly identified as having dementia by Jrip classification with 100% accuracy.	This pilot exploratory study indicates that machine learning methods can help identify community dwelling older adults with 10/66 criterion diagnosis of dementia with good accuracy in a LMIC setting such as India.

In total, 174 self-reported questionnaires were received (87% response rate). The most commonly cited reasons for why some students take these drugs were peer pressure (96%), academic stress (90%) and curiosity (88%). The most commonly cited justifiable reason was to go to sleep (34%). According to 77%, living in the college male hostel predisposed one to using these drugs. Sixty percent of students said that the drugs did not improve exam performance, while 54% said they alleviated stress. Seventy-eight percent said they did not intend to ever take drugs in the future.

701,33076949,Molecular brain,Brain transcriptome analysis reveals subtle effects on mitochondrial function and iron homeostasis of mutations in the SORL1 gene implicated in early onset familial Alzheimer's disease.,"To prevent or delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD), we must understand its molecular basis. The great majority of AD cases arise sporadically with a late onset after 65 years of age (LOAD). However, rare familial cases of AD can occur due to dominant mutations in a small number of genes that cause an early onset prior to 65 years of age (EOfAD). As EOfAD and LOAD share similar pathologies and disease progression, analysis of EOfAD genetic models may give insight into both subtypes of AD. Sortilin-related receptor 1 (SORL1) is genetically associated with both EOfAD and LOAD and provides a unique opportunity to investigate the relationships between both forms of AD. Currently, the role of SORL1 mutations in AD pathogenesis is unclear. To understand the molecular consequences of SORL1 mutation, we performed targeted mutagenesis of the orthologous gene in zebrafish. We generated an EOfAD-like mutation, V1482Afs, and a putatively null mutation, to investigate whether EOfAD-like mutations in sorl1 display haploinsufficiency by acting through loss-of-function mechanisms. We performed mRNA-sequencing on whole brains, comparing wild type fish with their siblings heterozygous for EOfAD-like or putatively loss-of-function mutations in sorl1, or transheterozygous for these mutations. Differential gene expression analysis identified a small number of differentially expressed genes due to the sorl1 genotypes. We also performed enrichment analysis on all detectable genes to obtain a more complete view on changes to gene expression by performing three methods of gene set enrichment analysis, then calculated an overall significance value using the harmonic mean p-value. This identified subtle effects on expression of genes involved in energy production, mRNA translation and mTORC1 signalling in both the EOfAD-like and null mutant brains, implying that these effects are due to sorl1 haploinsufficiency. Surprisingly, we also observed changes to expression of genes occurring only in the EOfAD-mutation carrier brains, suggesting gain-of-function effects. Transheterozygosity for the EOfAD-like and null mutations (i.e. lacking wild type sorl1), caused apparent effects on iron homeostasis and other transcriptome changes distinct from the single-mutation heterozygous fish. Our results provide insight into the possible early brain molecular effects of an EOfAD mutation in human SORL1. Differential effects of heterozygosity and complete loss of normal SORL1 expression are revealed.",Familial Alzheimer’s disease| Harmonic mean p-value| Iron homeostasis| Mitochondria| RNA-seq| SORL1| Zebrafish,Remaining,0,0

Starting in 2007, two clinics began integrating behavioral health into their primary care practices with a third starting in 2010. A fourth, nonimplementing, community clinic served as control. Change in emergency department and primary care utilization (number of visits) for patients diagnosed with mood and anxiety disorders was the outcomes of interest.	Retrospective data were obtained from electronic patient records from the three main area hospitals along with primary care data from participating clinics.	Following the introduction of the PCBH model, one clinic experienced a statistically significant (p < .01, 95 percent CI 6.3-16.3 percent), 11.3 percent decrease in the ratio of ED visits to primary care encounters, relative to a control site, but two other intervention clinics did not.	The PCBH model may be associated with a reduction in ED utilization, but better-controlled studies are needed to confirm this result.",ED visits| integrated care| primary care behavioral health| utilization,Remaining,0,0
705,11725215,"Neuropsychiatry, neuropsychology, and behavioral neurology",Behavioral changes in Huntington Disease.,"This study aimed to gain a better understanding of behavioral abnormalities in Huntington disease (HD) and to develop a method for reliably assessing these changes.	Behavioral changes are a central feature of HD and often cause considerable distress and difficulty to patients and their relatives. However, they have received little attention from research despite their prevalence and clinical significance.	One hundred thirty-four patients with HD were assessed using the Problem Behaviors Assessment for Huntington Disease (PBA-HD), an instrument for rating the presence, severity and frequency of behavioral abnormalities in HD.	The findings confirm that behavioral problems are common among patients with HD. The most common symptoms were loss of energy and initiative, poor perseverance and quality of work, impaired judgment, poor self-care and emotional blunting. Affective symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occurred in around half the patients studied. Psychotic symptoms (hallucinations and delusions) were rarely reported. Factor analysis distinguished three clusters of behavioral symptoms, which were interpreted respectively as reflecting Apathy, Depression and Irritability. The 'Apathy' factor was highly correlated with duration of illness, whereas no such relationship was observed for the 'Depression' and 'Irritability' factors.	The results suggest that certain behavioral changes are fundamental to the progression of HD, whereas others have a more complex relationship to the disease process. The findings have implications for the choice of behavioral measures used to evaluate efficacy of therapeutic interventions.",,Remaining,0,0

We aimed to establish the impact of this pandemic on epilepsy patients in terms of patient-reported seizure control and emerging symptoms.	This is a cross-sectional study including consecutive patients assessed by telephone contact in an epilepsy clinic during the first month of confinement. Demographic and clinical characteristics were recorded, and a 19-item questionnaire was systematically completed. Data regarding the impact of confinement, economic effects of the pandemic, and subjective perception of telemedicine were recorded. Additional clinical data were obtained in patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis.	Two hundred and fifty-five patients were recruited: mean age 48.2 ± 19.8 years, 121 (47.5%) women. An increase in seizure frequency was reported by 25 (9.8%) patients. Sixty-eight (26.7%) patients reported confinement-related anxiety, 22 (8.6%) depression, 31 (12.2%) both, and 72 (28.2%) insomnia. Seventy-three (28.6%) patients reported a reduction in economic income. Logistic regression analysis showed that tumor-related epilepsy etiology [OR = 7.36 (95% CI 2.17-24.96)], drug-resistant epilepsy [OR = 3.44 (95% CI 1.19-9.95)], insomnia [OR = 3.25 (95% CI 1.18-8.96)], fear of epilepsy [OR = 3.26 (95% CI 1.09-9.74)], and income reduction [OR = 3.65 (95% CI 1.21-10.95)] were associated with a higher risk of increased seizure frequency. Telemedicine was considered satisfactory by 214 (83.9%) patients. Five patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, with no changes in seizure frequency.	The COVID-19 pandemic has effects in epilepsy patients. Patients with tumor-related, drug-resistant epilepsy, insomnia, and economic difficulties are at a higher risk of increased seizure frequency.

MATERIAL AND METHODS There were 159 patients included in the cluster analysis who were ≥60 years and who underwent four-month follow-up. The first cluster contained 50 patients, the second cluster contained 74 patients, and the third cluster contained 35 patients. Clinical parameters were identified from electronic health records and patient questionnaires. Laboratory tests, anthropometric measurements, the number of chronic diseases, the number of prescribed medications were recorded. Frailty was determined using the five criteria of Fried's phenotype -model. Levels of anxiety and depression were recorded using the Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAS) and the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score assessed cognitive impairment. Logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of frailty and pre-frailty. RESULTS Three overlapping clusters of phenotypes predicted frailty, and included obesity (n=50), multimorbidity with mental impairment (n=74), and decline in renal function with cognitive impairment (n=35). The predictors of outcome included increasing age, number of chronic diseases, inflammation, anemia, anxiety, and cognitive impairment, and reduced muscle mass. CONCLUSIONS In patients ≥60 years in a primary healthcare setting, multimorbidity predictors of pre-frailty and frailty included a decline in cognitive function and renal function.",,Remaining,0,0

A prospective assessment of untreated anxiety symptoms and disorders among primary care patients.	Approximately 10% of eligible patients screened in clinic waiting rooms of a mixed-model health maintenance organization reported elevated symptoms and/or disorders of anxiety that were unrecognized and untreated. These patients with untreated anxiety reported significantly worse functioning on both physical and emotional measures than 'not anxious' comparison patients; in fact these patients reported reduced functioning levels within ranges that would be expected for patients with chronic physical diseases, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. The most severe reductions in functioning were reported by untreated patients whose anxiety was mixed with depression symptoms or disorders.	Primary care physicians may benefit from screening tools and consultations by mental health specialists to assist in recognition and diagnosis of anxiety symptoms and disorders alone and mixed with depression.",,Remaining,0,0

Forty-five patients with peripheral nervous disorders aged 13-19 were studied. Hereditary polyneuropathy of different types was diagnosed in 28 patients (62%); nine showed chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and two showed vasculitic neuropathy. In two more cases polyneuropathy was attributed to toxic agents, while among the rest, one was diagnosed as metachromatic leucodystrophy (juvenile type), one as adrenoleucodystrophy, one as porphyric neuropathy and one as Fabry disease. The high incidence of hereditary neuropathies in teenagers differs from that in adults, but is similar to that encountered in children. In our study, CIDP appears to be a frequent cause of neuropathy in teenagers, while the other causes are broadly similar to those found in studies concerning children rather than adults.",,Remaining,0,0

Previous studies focused on the relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in elderly patients with MDD, while ignore the young people. The aim of this study is to find the potential relationship between suicide attempts and metabolism in young patients with MDD to find a way to prevent and ultimately reduce suicide in young patients with MDD.	Cross-sectional design was employed in the study.740 patients aged between 18 and 45 years old with MDD had been consecutively recruited in this study between 2011 and 2017, 128 of whom had suicide attempts. Their serum samples used to monitor fasting blood glucose, serum lipids as well as socio-demographic characteristics were collected. Besides, some clinical scales were also employed to measure symptoms of anxiety, depression and other conditions.	This study indicated that compared with non-suicide attempters, suicide attempters in young patients with MDD showed higher levels of FBG, TC, LDL-C (all p <  0.05) and lower levels of HDL-C(p <  0.001). Further logistic regression analysis suggested that suicide attempts were associated with increased FBG, decreased HDL-C, the course of disease, HAMD scores and obvious anxiety.	Suicide attempts in young patients with MDD may be predicted by metabolic levels in the future. And our findings suggested that the level of FBG and HDL-C can be promising biomarkers to predict the occurrence of this event.",Biomarker| Major depressive disorder| Metabolism| Suicide attempt,Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to confirm that APOE allele polymorphism also represents a risk factor for unfavorable outcomes following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).	A total of 104 patients with aneurysmal SAH were studied. Computed tomography (CT) scan findings of SAH were assessed by Fisher's grade and clinical neurologic assessment was performed using the Hunt and Hess (H&H)grading system. Serum lipids were also analyzed. Outcomes at 3 months after SAH were determined using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.	The distributions of APOE genotypes and alleles of patients were matched with those of control subjects. That 5 of 18 patients with APOE-E4 allele (28%) had an unfavorable outcome was significantly different from those without APOE-E4 (8%, chi2, p = 0.032; OR = 4.34, 95% CI 1.20-15.75). However, the presence or absence of E2 or E3 alleles had no significant difference. The relative hazard of APOE-E4 for unfavorable outcome exited after adjustment for clinical assessment (OR = 6.95, 95% CI 1.21-39.75). Total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B were elevated in patients with unfavorable rather than favorable outcomes.	Our findings confirmed that the patients with APOE-E4 allele were predisposed to unfavorable outcomes after aneurysmal SAH even though an association between APOE and incidence of the SAH may not exist. The effect of APOE on neurobiology and lipoprotein metabolism seems to partially explain the difference in outcomes and deserves further study.",,Remaining,0,0

Biochemical composition of living tissues including the levels of Glu was analyzed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS). Previous reports point to decreased levels of Glu in AD. As Glu plays an important role in memory, we hypothesize that Glu levels are decreased in patients with AD when compared with controls. A consecutive sample of 30 patients with mild-to-moderate AD underwent H-MRS with the voxel placed in the bilateral posterior cingulate gyrus. For comparison purposes, we carried out the same technique in 68 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and in 26 controls. The healthy controls had higher metabolite levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) than patients with MCI and AD. In turn, patients with MCI and the controls had higher levels of Glu than in patients with AD. The differences were significant in the analysis of variance (ANOVA) test model corrected for age. In the post hoc analysis, the most remarkable differences were seen between patients with AD and the rest (patients with MCI and the controls).

Fourteen people with ABI and related gait pattern impairment (age 32 +/- 8 yr) wore an MTI Actigraph that measured activity (counts.min(-1)) and a Cosmed K4b(2) that measured oxygen consumption (mL.kg(-1).min(-1)) during four activities: quiet sitting (QS) and comfortable paced (CP), brisk paced (BP), and fast paced (FP) walking. MET levels were predicted from Actigraph counts using a published equation and compared with Cosmed measures. Predicted METs for each of the 56 activity bouts (14 participants x 4 bouts) were classified (light, moderate, vigorous, or very vigorous intensity) and compared with Cosmed-based classifications.	Repeated-measures ANOVA indicated that walking condition intensities were significantly different (P < 0.05) and the Actigraph detected the differences. Overall correlation between measured and predicted METs was positive, moderate, and significant (r = 0.74). Mean predicted METs were not significantly different from measured for CP and BP, but for FP walking, predicted METs were significantly less than measured (P < 0.05). The Actigraph correctly classified intensity for 76.8% of all activity bouts and 91.5% of light- and moderate-intensity bouts.	Actigraph counts provide a valid index of activity across the intensities investigated in this study. For light to moderate activity, Actigraph-based estimates of METs are acceptable for group-level analysis and are a valid means of classifying activity intensity. The Actigraph significantly underestimated higher intensity activity, although, in practice, this limitation will have minimal impact on activity measurement of most community-dwelling people with ABI.",,Remaining,0,0

The aim of the current study is to investigate brain activation during self- and other-reflection in patients with bipolar disorder (BD). In addition, we examined whether potential abnormal brain activation in BD patients could distinguish BD from patients with schizophrenia (SZ).	During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), 17 BD patients, 17 SZ patients and 21 healthy controls (HCs) performed a self-reflection task. The task consisted of sentences divided into three conditions: self-reflection, other-reflection and semantic control.	BD patients showed less activation in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) extending to the precuneus during other-reflection compared to HCs (p = 0.028 FWE corrected on cluster-level within the regions of interest). In SZ patients, the level of activation in this area was in between BD patients and HCs, with no significant differences between patients with SZ and BD. There were no group differences in brain activation during self-reflection. Moreover, there was a positive correlation between the PCC/precuneus activation during other-reflection and cognitive insight in SZ patients, but not in BD patients.	BD patients showed less activation in the PCC/precuneus during other-reflection. This may support an account of impaired integration of emotion and memory (evaluation of past and current other-related information) in BD patients. Correlation differences of the PCC/precuneus activation with the cognitive insight in patients with BD and SZ might reflect an important difference between these disorders, which may help to further explore potentially distinguishing markers.",Bipolar disorder| Other-reflection| Posterior cingulate cortex| Precuneus| Schizophrenia| Self-reflection,Remaining,0,0

However, there is a lack of literature in quantitative measures of motor control, which may potentially characterize the nature of the speech impairments in these children. This study investigated speech motor control in children with cerebral palsy (CP) using kinematic analysis.	We collected 10 children with mild spastic CP, aged 4.8 to 7.5 years, and 10 age-matched children with typical development (TD) from rehabilitation department at a tertiary hospital. All children underwent analysis of percentage of consonants correct (PCC) and kinematic analysis of speech tasks: poly-syllable (PS) and mono-syllable (MS) tasks using the Vicon Motion 370 system integrated with a digital camcorder. Kinematic parameters included spatiotemporal indexes (STIs), and average values and coefficients of variation (CVs) of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity. An ANOVA was conducted to determine whether PCC and kinematic data significantly differed between groups.	CP group had relatively lower PCCs (80.0-99.0%) than TD group (p = 0.039). CP group had higher STIs in PS speech tasks, but not in MS tasks, than TD group did (p = 0.001). The CVs of utterance duration for MS and PS tasks of children with CP were at least three times as large as those of TD children (p < 0.01). However, average values of utterance duration, peak oral opening displacement and velocity and CVs of other kinematic data for both tasks did not significantly differ between two groups.	High STI values and high variability on utterance durations in children with CP reflect deficits in relative spatial and/or especially temporal control for speech in the CP participants compared to the TD participants. Children with mild spastic CP may have more difficulty in processing increased articulatory demands and resulted in greater oromotor variability than normal children. The kinematic data such as STIs can be used as indices for detection of speech motor control impairments in children with mild CP and assessment of the effectiveness in the treatment.",,Remaining,0,0

Paper-based screening tools previously reported in this group require assessment by clinicians and subsequent collation of data. We describe our experience of a new system - IMPARTS (Integrating mental and physical: research training and services), which uses validated tools to identify and to monitor the progress of patients who may benefit from psychological intervention. At outpatient clinics, patients used an electronic tablet to complete the General Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7), the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), the Inclusion of Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). Data were linked directly to their electronic record to allow the results, with suggestions for treatment, to be reviewed immediately during the consultation. A total of 162 patients were included. Screening showed that referral was required in 28 (17%) with a probable major depressive disorder and 32 (20%) with a general anxiety disorder. Two (1%), who were identified as being at high risk of suicide or self-harm, were referred for immediate psychological assessment. Use of the system can aid the holistic treatment of patients with TMD through appropriate referral.

Using longitudinal data from an epidemiological twin sample (N = 7463), this study tested whether resilience would act as a buffer for stressful life events (SLEs) against risk for major depressive disorder (MDD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Resilience, demographics, and psychopathology were measured at Time 1 and recent SLEs and current MDD and GAD were measured at Time 2.	Final models, controlling for demographic covariates and Time 1 diagnosis, examined the impact of Time 1 resilience, recent SLEs, their interaction, and a three-way interaction adding sex on MDD and GAD.	The pattern of findings was the same for MDD and GAD, wherein main effects and two-way interactions of resilience and SLEs were significant, such that greater resilience was protective even in the context of high numbers of past-year SLEs. The three-way interaction was not significant, suggesting that the relationship between SLEs and resilience on psychopathology was the same for both men and women. Findings support the conceptualization of resilience as a buffer against the impact of future life stressors on common internalizing psychopathology. Longitudinal designs and trajectory-based studies that include recurring measures of SLEs could inform conceptualizations of resilience in the context of ongoing adversity and aid in developing interventions aimed at fostering healthy adaptation in the face of stressors.",anxiety| depression| life stress| longitudinal studies| psychological| resilience,Remaining,0,0

Does this suggest some potential correlation between the two diseases? Low bone mass and change of bone biomarker are associated with a higher risk of carotid and cardiac calcification plaques.	Bone mineral density (BMD) and bone metabolism marker may contribute to the progression of carotid and cardiac arterial calcifications. The aim of this study was to investigate whether low bone mass and the change of bone biomarker are associated with the prevalence of calcified atherosclerotic plaque in elderly Chinese.

Of 1571 community residents over 60 years of age, 184 (11.7%) subjects developed carotid calcified plaque, 510 (32.5%) subjects developed cardiac calcified plaque and 97 (6.2%) subjects developed co-existence calcified plaques in carotid and cardiac arteries. After adjustment for age and all relevant confounders, Q1, Q2 quartile of BMD, and osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteocalcin (OC), and C-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) were associated with increased risk of calcified plaques.	This study suggested that lower BMD and change of bone metabolism biomarker were associated with a higher risk of carotid and cardiac calcified plaque development.",Bone metabolism marker| Bone mineral density| Calcified plaque| Cardiac artery| Carotid artery,Remaining,0,0
726,32623925,"Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)",Genetically Predicted Blood Pressure Across the Lifespan: Differential Effects of Mean and Pulse Pressure on Stroke Risk.,"Hypertension is the leading risk factor for stroke. Yet, it remains unknown whether blood pressure pulsatility (pulse pressure [PP]) causally affects stroke risk independently of the steady pressure component (mean arterial pressure [MAP]). It is further unknown how the effects of MAP and PP on stroke risk vary with age and stroke cause. Using data from UK Biobank (N=408 228; 38-71 years), we selected genetic variants as instruments for MAP and PP at age ≤55 and >55 years and across age deciles. We applied multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses to explore associations with ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and their subtypes. Higher genetically predicted MAP was associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage across the examined age spectrum. Independent of MAP, higher genetically predicted PP only at age >55 years was further associated with higher risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio per-SD-increment, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.13-1.34]). Among subtypes, the effect of genetically predicted MAP on large artery stroke was attenuated, whereas the effect of genetically predicted PP was augmented with increasing age. Genetically predicted MAP, but not PP, was associated with small vessel stroke and deep intracerebral hemorrhage homogeneously across age deciles. Neither genetically predicted MAP nor PP were associated with lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Beyond an effect of high MAP at any age on ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, our results support an independent causal effect of high PP at older ages on large artery stroke. This finding warrants further investigation for the development of stroke preventive strategies targeting pulsatility in later life.",Mendelian randomization analysis| arterial pressure| blood pressure| hypertension,Remaining,0,0

We hypothesized that the parenchymal abnormality on CTASI in faster scanners would overestimate ischemic core.	This prospective study assessed the correlation of Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) on NCCT, CTASI, and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) with final infarct size in patients within 8 hours of AIS. Follow-up with NCCT or diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at 24 hours. Correlations of NCCT and CTASI with final infarct size and with CTP parameters were assessed. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients who underwent intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Inter-rater reliability was tested using Spearman's rank correlation. A P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.	A total of 105 patients were included in the final analysis. NCCT had a stronger correlation with the final infarct size than did CTASI (Spearman's ρ = .85 versus .78, P = .13). We found an overestimation of the final infarct size by CTASI in 47.6% of the cases, whereas NCCT underestimated infarct size in 60% of the patients. NCCT correlated most strongly with CBV (ρ = .93), whereas CTASI correlated most strongly with CBF (ρ = .87). Subgroup analysis showed less correlation of CTASI with final infarct size in the group that received thrombolysis versus the group that did not (ρ = .70 versus .88, P = .01).	In a 256-slice scanner, the CTASI parenchymal abnormality includes ischemic penumbra and thus overestimates final infarct size-this could result in inappropriate exclusion of patients from thrombolysis or thrombectomy.",256-Slice computed tomography| ASPECTS| CT angiography source image| final infarct size| noncontrast CT,Remaining,0,0

We designed a cohort study to construct prediction models for chronic kidney disease in the Chinese population.	A total of 5168 participants were followed up during a median of 2.2 (interquartile range, 1.5-2.9) years, and 190 individuals (3.7%) developed chronic kidney disease, defined by a glomerular filtration rate of less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2).	We developed a point system to estimate chronic kidney disease risk at 4 years using the following variables: age (8 points), body mass index (2 points), diastolic blood pressure (2 points), and history of type 2 diabetes (1 point) and stroke (4 points) for the clinical model, with the addition of uric acid (2 points), postprandial glucose (1 point), hemoglobin A1c (1 point), and proteinuria 100 mg/dL or greater (6 points) for the biochemical model. Similar discrimination measures were found between the clinical model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.768; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.738-0.798) and the biochemical model (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.765; 95% CI, 0.734-0.796). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the clinical model was 0.667 (95% CI, 0.631-0.703) for the external validation data from community-based cohort participants. The optimal cutoff value for the clinical model was set as 7, with a sensitivity of 0.76 and a specificity of 0.66.

730,6799932,Pediatrics,Relationship of pneumothorax to occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn.,"The relationship of pneumothorax to the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) has been studied in the premature newborn. The major objective of the study was to determine whether the systemic hemodynamic changes that occur with pneumothorax are reflected in the cerebral circulation and whether these changes play a role in pathogenesis of IVH. Blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous Doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life. At the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity, especially during diastole, and, with resolution of pneumothorax, flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours. The changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax, ie, and increase in mean systemic blood pressure, especially diastolic pressure. IVH, documented by serial ultrasound scans, was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants. The data thus demonstrate a marked increase in flow velocity in the cerebral circulation at the time of pneumothorax. This increase is of importance in the genesis of IVH as is suggested further by the occurrence of IVH soon after the cerebral hemodynamic changes.",,Remaining,0,0

This study explored mediation of these links via trajectories of child conduct and emotional problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire) from ages 4-16 years old in data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children cohort (n = 13373). Through gender-specific structural equation models, a composite measure of exposure to early maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale), predicted young adult depression at age 18 (Revised Clinical Interview Schedule - distal outcome). Mediational effects were then estimated by testing which parts of joint piecewise latent trajectory models for child/adolescent conduct and emotional problems were associated with both exposure and distal outcome. For girls, only conduct problems in early childhood were consistently indicated to mediate effects of early maternal depression on risk of young adulthood depression. Some evidence for a pathway via changing levels of childhood and adolescent emotional difficulties was also suggested. For boys, by contrast, the differing models gave less consistent findings providing some evidence for a small time-specific indirect effect via early childhood conduct problems. In addition to its practice implications the current methodological application offers considerable potential in exploratory longitudinal developmental mediation studies. © 2016 The Authors International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",ALSPAC| emotional and conduct problems| longitudinal mediation| maternal depression| young adult depression,Remaining,0,0

Depression and recent use of health services were assessed in 542 patients aged 60 or over who were consecutively admitted to university medical services. Depression was measured by using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the depressive disorders section of the National Institute of Mental Health Diagnostic Interview Schedule, which was administered by a psychiatrist.	After age, sex, race, education, and severity of medical illness were controlled for, Hamilton depression score significantly predicted hospital days in the past year, hospital days and total inpatient days (hospital plus nursing home) in the past 3 months, and number of outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months. Depressed patients had more hospital days in the past year and had more hospital days, total inpatient days, and outpatient medical visits in the past 3 months than did nondepressed patients. Associations between depression and length of index hospital stay, home health visits, nursing home days, and number of prescription medications disappeared when severity of medical illness was controlled. Mental health visits were no more common among depressed than nondepressed patients.

Thirty-two patients (mean age 47 years) with histologically proven or suspected high grade glioma (n = 12) or metastatic brain lesions (n = 20) were prospectively examined by MR imaging. After the administration of gadolinium dimeglumine (0.1 mmol/kg body weight) the lesions were imaged with a T1-weighted MT-fast low angle shot (FLASH) pulse sequence and with a conventional T1-weighted SE sequence without MT saturation.	The mean CNR of enhancing lesions on T1-weighted MT-FLASH was 15 +/- 5 compared to 11 +/- 4 on SE images, representing a significant (p < .01) improvement. The mean tumor diameter of malignant gliomas was significantly (p < .01) larger measured on T1-weighted MT-FLASH images compared to those obtained from T1-weighted SE images and were comparable for metastatic lesions.

Orexin-A and CRF were determined by radioimmunoassay methods. Significantly higher levels of orexin-A and CRF were found in the CSF of MOH and to a lesser extent in patients with CM compared with control subjects (orexin-A: P < 0.001 and P < 0.02; CRF: P < 0.002 and P < 0.0003).

741,28728096,European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists,Early life stress explains reduced positive memory biases in remitted depression.,"There is contradictory evidence regarding negative memory biases in major depressive disorder (MDD) and whether these persist into remission, which would suggest their role as vulnerability traits rather than correlates of mood state. Early life stress (ELS), common in patients with psychiatric disorders, has independently been associated with memory biases, and confounds MDD versus control group comparisons. Furthermore, in most studies negative biases could have resulted from executive impairments rather than memory difficulties per se.	To investigate whether memory biases are relevant to MDD vulnerability and how they are influenced by ELS, we developed an associative recognition memory task for temporo-spatial contexts of social actions with low executive demands, which were matched across conditions (self-blame, other-blame, self-praise, other-praise). We included fifty-three medication-free remitted MDD (25 with ELS, 28 without) and 24 healthy control (HC) participants without ELS.	Only MDD patients with ELS showed a reduced bias (accuracy/speed ratio) towards memory for positive vs. negative materials when compared with MDD without ELS and with HC participants; attenuated positive biases correlated with number of past major depressive episodes, but not current symptoms. There were no biases towards self-blaming or self-praising memories.	This demonstrates that reduced positive biases in associative memory were specific to MDD patients with ELS rather than a general feature of MDD, and were associated with lifetime recurrence risk which may reflect a scarring effect. If replicated, our results would call for stratifying MDD patients by history of ELS when assessing and treating emotional memories.",Associative memory| Early life stress| Emotional bias| Major depressive disorder| Overgeneralisation,Remaining,0,0

While amyloid deposition has been noted within atrial appendages, the incidence and significance remains incompletely understood. More accurate amyloid typing methodologies and targeted pharmacotherapeutics have recently been developed, prompting pathologists to provide more detailed information about the type of amyloid identified in such samples. This study sought to fully characterize the morphologic characteristics of atrial amyloid as well as its incidence and clinical significance. Tissue archives were queried for atrial appendages removed during the cardiac surgeries (2010-2014). Patient demographics, imaging features, and salient clinical findings were recorded. Pattern and extent of amyloid deposition were recorded. Typing of the amyloid protein, when present, was performed on a subset of cases by laser capture microdissection with mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis. A total of 383 atrial appendages from 345 consecutive patients were included in the study (mean age, 69 years; range, 26-92 years). Amyloid was present in 46% of patients. A linear relationship was observed between age and presence of atrial amyloidosis. Women were more likely to have atrial amyloidosis. Two distinct morphologies of amyloid were observed: filamentous and nonfilamentous, and correlated perfectly with amyloid type (filamentous = AANF-type amyloid; nonfilamentous = ATTR-type amyloid). Filamentous deposits were observed in 91% of those with amyloid. Amyloid was more likely to be found in the left atrial appendage than the right. Patients with atrial amyloid, irrespective of type, were more likely to have experienced stroke or TIA and more likely to have atrial arrhythmia preoperatively. Postoperatively, those with atrial amyloid are more likely to experience recurrence of arrhythmia than those who did not have atrial amyloid. Understanding the morphologic characteristics of AANF-type amyloid will allow for identification by the light microscopy and obviates the need for expensive ancillary typing techniques. The finding of nonfilamentous amyloid, should still prompt confirmation of amyloid type so that targeted therapy may be employed.",,Remaining,0,0

We applied a less sensitive enzyme immunoassay (LS-EIA) (Vironostika, BioMerieux, Durham, NC) to the diagnostic blood specimen of 1022 persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed for the first time in 2001. The distribution of transmission risk among HIV-negative persons--men who have sex with men (MSM), injection drug users (IDUs), heterosexuals-from a large telephone health survey was used to generate denominators for transmission risk groups.	The 1022 persons tested by the LS-EIA represented 27% of all persons in whom HIV (non-AIDS) had been diagnosed in New York City during 2001. The incidence of HIV was estimated to be 0.29% per year (95% CI: 0.20-0.38), and was significantly higher for men than women (rate ratio 3.6, 95% CI: 2.6-5.1), and HIV incidence increased with age. Male IDU and MSM testers had the highest HIV incidence rates: 2.7% per year (95% CI: 2.3-3.1) and 2.5% per year (95% CI: 2.1-2.8), respectively.	Male IDUs and MSM may be good candidates for intensified targeting of HIV prevention resources in New York City.",,Remaining,0,0

We conducted a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled trial at the outpatient clinics at Washington University and Duke University on 126 subjects, aged 60 years or older, who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition criteria for major depression, scored 20 or more on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and received neuropsychological testing and magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were excluded for cognitive impairment or severe medical disorders. After 12 weeks of sertraline treatment, subjects' MADRS scores over time and neuropsychological factors were studied.	Left anterior cingulate thickness was significantly smaller in the late-onset depressed group than in the early-onset LLD subjects. The late-onset group also had more hyperintensities than the early-onset LLD subjects. No differences were found in neuropsychological factor scores or treatment outcome between early-onset and late-onset LLD subjects.	Age at onset of depressive symptoms in LLD subjects are associated with differences in cortical thickness and white matter and subcortical gray matter hyperintensities, but age at onset did not affect neuropsychological factors or treatment outcome.",Late-life depression| age at onset| amygdala| antidepressant| cognitive deficit| hippocampus| neuropsychological factors| treatment outcome| vascular risk factors| white matter hyperintensities,Remaining,0,0
748,7957408,European journal of pediatrics,X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy in patients with idiopathic Addison disease.,"The two main causes of primary adrenal disease are tuberculosis and auto-immune adrenal destruction. The latter is responsible for about 70% of the cases of primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). Commonly referred to as a rare cause of adrenal failure is X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), a demyelinating peroxisomal disorder affecting 1: 20,000 Caucasian males. Albeit primary adrenal insufficiency is a rare entity per se, we decided to study patients with idiopathic Addison disease and establish the frequency of ALD as a cause of adrenal insufficiency. The biochemical defect of ALD was found in 5 out of 24 patients. The small number of cases in our series led us to include in our analysis the published results of two other groups of investigators. This analysis indicates that the proportion of cases in which Addison disease is attributable to ALD is age dependent. It is highest when the adrenal insufficiency manifests before 15 years. This study clearly demonstrates that the proportion of ALD in patients presenting primary adrenal insufficiency has been under-estimated.	Addison disease manifesting during the first decade of life has a high likelihood of being the first sign of X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.",,Remaining,0,0

A two-stage cross-sectional study, carried out between 2012 and 2014, included all 9th grade students from 5 Arab localities, representative of 77% of the Muslim and 100% of Druze citizens in Israel. During the screening stage, 1639 students completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire in the classroom (response rate = 69.3%). During the follow-up stage, 704 adolescent-mother dyads were interviewed at home; using the Development and Well-Being Assessment, the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12, the Subjective Feeling of Discrimination Index (FDI), and socio-demographic questions (response rate = 84.4%).	Prevalence of any disorder, internalizing or externalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were 19.2, 15.8 and 4.2%, respectively and among Druze adolescents 10.9, 5.9 and 5.5%, respectively. Muslim adolescents were 3.2 times more likely than Druze adolescents to have an internalizing disorder, while Druze were 2 times more likely than Muslim to have an externalizing disorder. Males were at higher risk than females for externalizing disorders in both populations, though among Druze the risk was more striking. Learning disabilities increased the likelihood of having an externalizing disorder in both populations. Risk factors for internalizing disorders among Muslim adolescents were female gender, a very low socio-economic level, few siblings, LD, high maternal GHQ-12 score and high FDI; and for externalizing disorders, male gender, a relatively low socio-economic level but not the lowest, learning disability and high maternal GHQ-12 score.	We found an association between religion/ethnicity and internalizing and externalizing disorders as well as a strong correlation between religion/ethnicity and socio-economic variables. Therefore, we tend to conclude that not religion per se but the multifaceted socio-cultural and economic factors that characterize religious groups are associated with mental disorders. Very low socio-economic level and feeling discriminated which were traits connected only to Muslim adolescents, were associated with internalizing disorders. When preparing preventive measures aimed at furthering mental health among minority adolescents, authorities should focus on improving the socio-economic status of minorities and reducing institutional and personal discrimination. The educational and mental health establishments could undertake measures to improve resilience and coping strategies of Muslim families living in the most adverse conditions, such as providing special support through the school counseling services and coordinating, at the ministerial levels, school and community health services in order to carry out joint preventive programs and referrals to specialist services when needed.",,Remaining,0,0

A prospective, observational feasibility study was carried out.	Intensive Care Unit of a third level hospital.	Consecutive recording was made of the adults diagnosed with brain death based on clinical criteria following admission to the Intensive Care Unit in the period from January to December 2017.	The procedure was performed at the patient bedside with the intravenous administration of technetium 99 metastable hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. The absence of perfusion in the cerebral hemispheres and brainstem was described as a pattern consistent with BD. The diagnosis was correlated to the transcranial Doppler and / or electroencephalographic findings.	A total of 66.1% of the patients were men with an average age of 60 years [IQR: 51-72]. The most frequent causes resulting in BD were hemorrhagic stroke (48.2%, n=27), followed by traumatic brain injury (30.4%, n=17), ischemic stroke (10.7%, n=6) and post-cardiac arrest anoxic encephalopathy (7.1%, n=4). A clinical diagnosis of BD was made in all cases, and the portable gamma-camera confirmed the diagnosis in 100% of the patients with a pattern characterized by the absence of brain perfusion. In addition, the results were compared with the transcranial Doppler findings in 46 patients, confirming the presence of diastolic reverberation and / or systolic peaks. The electroencephalographic tracing was obtained in 10 cases, with the appearance of electrical silence, due to the absence of an acoustic window in the transcranial Doppler study.

A growing body of dual-task (DT) studies suggests a role of executive functions in gait control and falls, particularly in subacute stroke. However, few studies have compared distinct executive and non-executive tasks, nor their effects on chronic stroke gait.	The purpose of this cross-sectional study was to compare the effects of distinct working memory (2-back) and inhibition (Stroop) tasks on walking gait performance in chronic stroke survivors.	A pilot sample of chronic stroke survivors (n = 11, 8 males, mean age = 70.91, 6-12months post-stroke event) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 13, 4 male; mean age = 68.46) were tested. Gait performance (speed, stride time, stride time variability, stride length and stride length variability) was measured using 2 wireless inertial measurement sensors under 4 walking conditions: 1) preferred walking (single-task: ST), 2) walking with a 2-back DT, 3) walking with a Stroop DT, and 4) walking with a non-executive motor response DT. The secondary tasks were also carried out in both ST (seated) and DT conditions, to examine bidirectional effects.	While the stroke survivor sample had a slower gait speed across conditions and tasks, there were no significant differences between the groups [F(1, 22) = 1.13, p =.299, η[2]p =  .049] on the spatial or temporal gait characteristics recorded: gait performance was maintained during executive and non-executive DTs. In addition, we did not find a significant effect of group on cognitive task performance (all p > .052). However, we observed a cost in accuracy on the 2-back DT for both groups, suggesting resource overlap and greater cognitive load (all t > 19.72, all p <  .001).

Clinical,White matter microstructural abnormalities in children with severe congenital hypothyroidism.,"This study assessed white matter microstructural integrity and behavioral correlates for children with severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who were identified and treated early following newborn screening. Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH. The results indicate that children with severe CH who are identified through newborn screening may have significant brain white matter microstructural abnormalities despite early treatment.",Communication| Diffusion tensor imaging| Endocrine| Hearing| MRI,Remaining,0,0

758,7981153,International immunology,Acid sphingomyelinase is not essential for the IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor signaling pathway leading to NFkB activation.,"A recent report has suggested that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) utilizes acid sphingomyelinase (SMase) pathway to activate NFkB (Schutze et al. 1992. Cell 71:765). To directly investigate the role of acid SMase in IL-1 and TNF receptor-mediated signal transduction, we examined the ability of Niemann-Pick disease (NPD) type A fibroblasts, which are deficient in acid SMase, to induce IL-8 gene expression through activating NFkB. Unexpectedly, IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha efficiently induced IL-8 production and IL-8 mRNA in NPD type A fibroblasts as in normal fibroblasts. Furthermore, activation of NFkB was also induced in NPD type A fibroblasts in response to IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha stimulation to a similar extent as in normal fibroblasts. These results provide evidence that acid SMase is not essential in IL-1 and TNF receptor signaling leading to NFkB activation as well as the cytokine gene activation which is regulated by NFkB.",,Remaining,0,0
759,14733976,Research in developmental disabilities,Sleep problems as possible predictors of intensified symptoms of autism.,"Researchers have been placing an increased importance on discovering what variables contribute to better prognosis during behavioral interventions for children with autism. This article preliminarily identifies sleep problems that may exacerbate symptoms of autism; thus, possibly influencing effectiveness of daytime interventions. A data-base of parent report of sleep problems of children with autism (N=55), ranging from 5 to 12 years of age (M=8.2 years) was evaluated. Results suggested that fewer hours of sleep per night predicted overall autism scores and social skills deficits. Similarly, stereotypic behavior was predicted by fewer hours of sleep per night and screaming during the night. Increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom and screaming at night predicted communication problems. Finally, sensitivity to environmental stimuli in the bedroom also predicted fewer developmental sequence disturbances. The results indicate that sleep problems and the diagnostic characteristics of autism may be related. However, future research must be completed to determine the specific relationship.",,Remaining,0,0

Nevertheless, these modalities are often insufficient for achieving a definite diagnosis. The aims of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combination of these tools.	The SPECT radiotracers [I]-N-ω-fluoropropyl-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-nortropane (FP-CIT) and meta-[I]-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) were used to research presynaptic dopaminergic projections (DAT SPECT) and myocardial adrenergic innervation (MIBG scintigraphy), respectively. PD patients (n=15; age: 61.5±13.6 years) and non-PD patients (n=19; age: 62.6±14.2 years) who underwent both tests were enrolled in this study. Receiver-operating characteristic analyses were used to set the cutoff values of the specific binding ratio in DAT SPECT and the heart to mediastinum ratio in delayed scan in MIBG scintigraphy for differentiating PD from non-PD. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of the individual methods and also the combination of these two modalities.	When DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy were used individually, they showed mild accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD (DAT, 67.6%; MIBG, 67.6%). The combination of the two approaches using cutoff values of less than 3.24 for the specific binding ratio and less than 2.745 for the delayed heart to mediastinum ratio enabled more accurate differentiation between PD and non-PD. The accuracy of these indices in distinguishing PD from non-PD was 79.4%.	These results suggested that the combination of DAT SPECT and MIBG scintigraphy may improve the diagnostic accuracy in differentiating PD from non-PD.",,Remaining,0,0

The assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct, however. We report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy, where high-resolution brain MRI disclosed a unilateral, focal, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case; nevertheless, based on electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings, ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the MRI lesion. All patients underwent epilepsy surgery, with the operations based on ictal EEG findings, and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection. After the most recent follow-up examination, 50% (10/20) of the patients were completely seizure-free, 35% (7/20) had at least a 75% reduction in the number of seizures, and 15% (3/20) had less than a 75% reduction in the number of seizures. We conclude that the identification of a focal, structural, hippocampal, or neocortical lesion on brain MRI is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy. Furthermore, in cases of discordance between MRI and EEG data, a good outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if EEG ictal onsets are definitive.",,Remaining,0,0

In these conditions it was possible to observe the intrinsic or free-running behavior of circadian pacemakers and thereby to test several hypotheses about the role of sleep and circadian rhythms in the pathogenesis of depression. No hypothesis was consistently supported by the results. We found that the intrinsic rhythm of a circadian pacemaker appeared to free-run with an abnormally fast frequency in one patient. No patient remained stably depressed during temporal isolation. Our experience suggests that this type of study can be carried out safely with appropriate precautions.

Baseline period from January 1 to March 8, 2020, was compared with the COVID period from March 9, to April 2, 2020. The variables included were total daily stroke alerts across the hospital emergency departments, thrombolysis, time to presentation, stroke severity, time from door-to-imaging, time from door-to-needle in thrombolysis, and time from door-to-puncture in thrombectomy. The 2 time periods were compared using nonparametric statistics and Poisson regression.	Nine hundred two stroke alerts during the period across the emergency departments were analyzed. Total daily stroke alerts decreased from median, 10 (interquartile range, 8-13) during baseline period to median, 8 (interquartile range, 4-10, P=0.001) during COVID period. Time to presentation, stroke severity, and time to treatment were unchanged. COVID period was associated with decrease in stroke alerts with rate ratio of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.60-0.28). Thrombolysis also decreased with rate ratio, 0.52 (95% CI, 0.28-0.97) but thrombectomy remained unchanged rate ratio, 0.93 (95% CI, 0.52-1.62) Conclusions: We observed a significant decrease in acute stroke presentations by ≈30% across emergency departments at the time of surge of COVID-19 cases.

The objectives of this study were to investigate patients' participation rate in the discussion of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) / Do-Not-Attempt-Resuscitation (DNAR) order, and in the discussion that the patient is at his/her EOL stage (EOL disclosure), and to explore their associated factors.	This is a retrospective chart review study. The participants were all the patients who were hospitalized and died in a university-affiliated teaching hospital (tertiary medical facility) in central Tokyo, Japan during the period from April 2018 to March 2019. The following patients were excluded: (1) cardiopulmonary arrest on arrival; (2) stillbirth; (3) under 18 years old at the time of death; and (4) refusal by their bereaved family. Presence or absence of CPR/DNAR discussion and EOL disclosure, patients' involvement in those discussions, and their associated factors were investigated.	CPR/DNAR discussions were observed in 336 out of the 358 patients (93.9%). However, 224 of these discussions were carried out without a patient (patient participation rate 33.3%). Male gender (odds ratio (OR) = 2.37 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.32-4.25]), living alone (OR = 2.51 [1.34-4.71]), and 1 year or more from the date of diagnosis (OR = 1.78 [1.03-3.10]) were associated with higher patient's participation in CPR/DNAR discussions.

Patients who died of cancer (OR = 2.41[1.45-4.03]) and patients without mental illness (OR=2.41 [1.11-5.25]) were more likely to participate in EOL disclosure.	In this clinical sample, only up to half of the patients participated in CPR/DNAR discussions and EOL disclosure. Female, living with family, a shorter period from the diagnosis, non-cancer, and mental illness presence are risk factors for lack of patients' participation in CPR/DNAR or EOL discussions.

The present study aimed to examine 1) whether DAX-1 is expressed in human pituitary adenomas, and 2) if it is expressed, what types of adenoma express the factor.	Adenoma tissues examined included 18 clinically non-functioning adenomas, 14 GH-secreting adenomas and 7 PRL-secreting adenomas. The expression of the following genes were tested by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR): DAX-1, Adrenal-4-binding protein/steroidogenic factor-1 (Ad4BP/SF-1), Pit-1, LH beta, FSH beta, gonadotrophin-releasing hormone receptor (GnRH-R), GH, PRL, and TSH beta, as well as beta-actin as a control.	Eleven clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed DAX-1, 10 of which also expressed Ad4BP/SF-1. Nine out of the 11 DAX-1 expressing adenomas also expressed LH beta, FSH beta and GnRH-R as well, indicating that these adenomas possessed gonadotrophic properties. Nine clinically non-functioning adenomas expressed Pit-1 as well as GH, PRL and/or TSH beta, thus having somatomammotrophic or thyrotrophic properties, 3 of which overlapped with the above DAX-1-expressing adenomas. One non-functioning adenoma expressed Ad4BP/SF1 and FSH beta but not DAX-1, and another one expressed DAX-1 and Ad4BP/SF-1 with PRL. On the other hand, all GH-secreting and PRL-secreting adenomas expressed Pit-1 and GH and/or PRL, but neither DAX-1 nor Ad4BP/SF-1.

Over 60% of survivors at three weeks, six months and 12 months after the stroke were assessed for depressed mood, using the Wakefield self-assessment depression inventory, and on other functional and social activities. At each point, 25-30% of those assessed were depressed; over 50% of patients depressed at three weeks remained so at one year. Factors associated with depression included loss of functional independence, a low level of other activities, a low reasoning ability, and being female and living with someone; path analysis showed that most depression was not explained by these factors.

770,24463232,NeuroRehabilitation,Cognitive dysfunction and functional limitations are associated with major depression in stroke survivors attending rehabilitation in Nigeria.,"The frequency and predictors of post-stroke depression diagnosed according to codified criteria remain unknown in Nigeria.	We report on the predictors of post-stroke major depressive disorder (MDD) in Nigeria using standardized assessment methods.	Using a case-control design, we consecutively recruited 260 participants. Among them were 130 stroke survivors attending rehabilitation. Along with historical details, an exploration for MDD meeting criteria in the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders was carried out using a semi-structured interview. Cognition was assessed using both the Mini Mental State Examination and the modified Indiana University Token test, while disability was assessed using the modified Rankin Scale. Associations were explored using univariate and multivariate analyses.	The diagnosis of MDD was more frequently present in the stroke survivors (41.5%, p < 0.001). It was strongly associated with female gender (p < 0.001, O.R = 3.77, 95% C.I = 1.78-8.00), disability (p = 0.001, O.R = 3.27, 95% C.I = 1.57-6.83), and cognitive dysfunction (p < 0.001, O.R = 5.28, 95% C.I = 2.25-12.41). Female gender (p = 0.037, O.R = 2.65, 95% C.I = 1.06-6.62) and cognitive dysfunction (P = 0.03, O.R = 4.58, 95% C.I = 1.68-12.46) were independent predictors of post-stroke MDD.	Post stroke MDD is common in Nigerian survivors attending rehabilitation.

The impact of withdrawal from substances that have different neurological mechanisms on BDNF levels is unclear. Our goal was to compare serum BDNF levels in inpatients with alcohol or crack cocaine use disorders during the early withdrawal period, and to evaluate the association with substance-related outcomes. We performed a follow-up study with 101 men under detoxification treatment (drug preference: alcohol [n = 37] and crack cocaine [n = 64]). Blood samples were collected on the 1st and 15th days of hospitalization to measure serum BDNF levels. Serum BDNF levels increased during the early stage of withdrawal (28.2 ± 10.0 vs. 32.6 ± 13.3, p < 0.001), similarly in individuals with alcohol and crack cocaine use. In the alcohol group, BDNF levels on the 15th day of hospitalization were negatively correlated with age (r = -0.394, p = 0.023). Delta BDNF levels were also negatively correlated with BDNF on the 1st day of hospitalization (p = 0.011). No significant correlation was found regarding substance-related outcomes. This is the first study to compare BDNF levels in alcohol and crack cocaine users undergoing similar treatment conditions. These findings could be related to clinical improvement after abstinence or even to drug withdrawal itself, decreasing neuronal injury. Furthermore, age may be a crucial factor, hindering the recovery of neuroplasticity in alcohol users.",Alcohol use disorder| Brain-derived neurotrophic factor| Cocaine use disorder| Substance use disorder,Remaining,0,0

Previous studies indicate that several components of emotional processing are intact in schizophrenia when subjects are instructed to attend to emotionally-evocative stimuli. However, few studies have examined whether emotional stimuli capture attention to a normal degree in people with schizophrenia when attention is directed elsewhere. The current event-related potential study examined motivated attention to task-irrelevant emotional stimuli in 35 stabilized outpatients and 26 healthy controls with a modified visual P300 oddball detection task. Participants viewed images of rare target and commonly occurring standard letter stimuli, as well as intermixed emotional (unpleasant, pleasant, neutral) pictures. Subjects were instructed to count the number of rare targets; the emotional valence of the picture stimuli was, therefore, task-irrelevant. We separately evaluated the Early Posterior Negativity (EPN) and Late Positive Potential (LPP) to emotional pictures and the P300 to target stimuli. Patients and controls showed similar patterns of EPN and LPP amplitude to the emotional stimuli, such that the EPN and LPP were larger for both pleasant and unpleasant versus neutral pictures. Although patients performed worse than controls on the target counting task, both groups showed comparable P300 differentiation between target versus non-target stimuli. Emotional stimuli captured attentional resources in people with schizophrenia even when the emotional stimuli were task-irrelevant, suggesting intact motivated attention at the level of early electrophysiological responding.",,Remaining,0,0

Circadian disruption has been implicated in colorectal tumorigenesis in experimental studies. We prospectively examined the association between sleep duration and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC).	In the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, 75 828 postmenopausal women reported habitual sleep duration at baseline 1993-1998. We used Cox proportional hazards regression model to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of CRC and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI).	We ascertained 851 incident cases of CRC through 2010, with an average 11.3 years of follow-up. Compared with 7 h of sleep, the HRs were 1.36 (95% CI 1.06-1.74) and 1.47 (95% CI 1.10-1.96) for short (≤5 h) and long (≥9 h) sleep duration, respectively, after adjusting for age, ethnicity, fatigue, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), physical activity, and waist to hip ratio. The association was modified by the use of HRT (P-interaction=0.03).	Both extreme short and long sleep durations were associated with a moderate increase in the risk of CRC in postmenopausal women.

The aim of this study was to compare the 2D:4D digit ratio, which is considered to be a morphological indicator of exposure to testosterone in the prenatal period, in individuals with GD.	The study included 99 participants diagnosed with GD comprising 54 assigned the female gender at birth [AFB-GD], 45 assigned the male gender at birth [AMB-GD], and 58 female and 58 male participants making up the control group. The right and the left hands of the participants were photocopied and finger lengths were measured using digital calipers.	The 2D:4D digit ratio on the right hand of the AFB-GD group was significantly lower (p=0.028) than that of the female controls, but it did not differ significantly as compared to male controls. The ratio on the left hand of the AFB-GD group did not significantly differ from that of the female controls, but it was higher than that of the male controls (p=0.045). The 2D:4D digit ratio on the right hand of the AMB-GD group did not differ significantly from that of the male controls, but they had a lower finger ratio as compared to the female controls (p<0.001).

Next, they provided their opinions about the information. Two coders analyzed the data using grounded theory.	Pre-video knowledge about why people smoke cigarettes and what genetic risk means informed beliefs about the relationship between genes and addiction. These beliefs were not always consistent with biomedical explanations, but formed the context through which participants processed the video's information. This, in turn, led to information acceptance or skepticism. Participants explained their reactions in terms of the scientific merits of the research and used their existing knowledge and beliefs to explain their acceptance of or skepticism about the information.

The Institute of Cognitive Neurology Frontal Screening (IFS) is a well-validated screening tool allowing the rapid assessment of multiple components of executive function in Spanish-speaking individuals. In this study, we examined performance on the IFS in subjects with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), an inherited condition leading to the early onset of SVD. We further explored associations between performance on the IFS and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of SVD.	We recruited 24 asymptomatic CADASIL subjects and 23 noncarriers from Colombia. All subjects underwent a research MRI and a neuropsychological evaluation, including the IFS. Structural MRI markers of SVD were quantified in each subject, together with an SVD Sum Score representing the overall burden of cerebrovascular alterations. General linear model, correlation, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to explore group differences on the IFS and relationships with MRI markers of SVD.	CADASIL subjects had a significantly reduced performance on the IFS Total Score. Performance on the IFS correlated with all quantified markers of SVD, except for brain atrophy and perivascular spaces enlargement. Finally, while the IFS Total Score was not able to accurately discriminate between carriers and noncarriers, it showed adequate sensitivity and specificity in detecting the presence of multiple MRI markers of SVD.	These results suggest that the IFS may be a useful screening tool to assess executive function and disease severity in the context of SVD.",Cerebral microbleeds| Enlarged perivascular spaces| Executive function| Lacunes| NOTCH3| Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging| Screening tool| Spanish| White matter hyperintensity,Remaining,0,0

The objective was to investigate GM changes in older depressed and similar aged healthy subjects using two different methods, cortical thickness in frontal lobe structures and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).	Sixty eight subjects participated (30 healthy comparison subjects, 38 depressed) and underwent 3T T1 MR imaging as well as clinical and cognitive assessments. Frontal cortical thickness was measured using FreeSurfer while VBM was undertaken using the DARTEL algorithm in SPM8. Group differences in cortical thickness and GM volumes were assessed using ANCOVA. Effects of cortical thickness and VBM results on cognitive and depression variables were also investigated.	No significant differences in frontal lobe cortical thickness were observed between groups (F(1, 62) ≤ 2.7, p ≥ 0.1). In addition, no significant relationships of cortical thickness on cognitive and depression scores were identified (partial correlation |r'|=0.01-0.31, p ≥ 0.06). VBM showed that GM volumes were indistinguishable between groups but significant age effects were apparent, independent of diagnosis.	Results suggest that cortical GM changes in late life depression (LLD) are similar to healthy older subjects and appear to be related to age rather than cognitive or depressive symptoms. Changes to white matter and subcortical GM structures may be more relevant in explaining the underlying neurobiology of LLD.",,Remaining,0,0

A quality improvement project was initiated at a nonpediatric community ED to implement an institution-specific, PECARN-based Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool. Baseline head CT use at the participating ED was determined for children with closed head injury through retrospective chart review from March 2014 through November 2015. Head injury patients were identified using International Classification of Disease (ICD)-9 codes for head injury, unspecified (959.01) and concussion with and without loss of consciousness (850-850.9) until October 2015, after which ICD-9 was no longer used. To identify eligible patients after October 2015, lists of all pediatric patients evaluated at the participating ED were reviewed, and patients were included in the analysis if they had a physician-assigned discharge diagnosis of head injury or concussion. Exclusion criteria were age ≥ 18 years, penetrating head trauma, history of brain tumor, ventriculoperitoneal shunt, bleeding disorder, or presentation > 24 hours postinjury. Medical history, injury mechanism, symptoms, head CT use, and disposition were recorded. Implementation of the Pediatric Closed Head Injury Assessment Tool was achieved through provider education sessions beginning in December 2015 and ending in August 2016. Head CT use was monitored for 12 months postimplementation, from September 2016 through August 2017. Patients were classified into low, intermediate, or high risk for clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI) by chart review. ED length of stay (LOS), disposition, and ED returns within 72 hours were recorded. Categorical variables were compared using chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and continuous variables, using Kruskal-Wallis test.	A total of 252 children with closed head injury were evaluated preimplementation (March 2014 through November 2015), 132 children were evaluated during implementation (December 2015 through August 2016), and 172 children were evaluated postimplementation (September 2016 through August 2017). Overall CT use decreased from 37.7% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 31.7-43.7) preimplementation to 16.9% (95% CI = 11.3-22.5) postimplementation (p < 0.001). Only 1% (95% CI = 0%-2.9%) of low-risk patients received a head CT postimplementation compared to 22.6% (95% CI = 16.1%-29.1%) preimplementation (p < 0.001). CT use among patients ≥ 24 months decreased from 42.9% (95% CI = 36.5%-49.6%) to 19.6% (95% CI = 13.1%-26.1%; p < 0.001) and remained low and unchanged for patients < 24 months. Transfers to a pediatric trauma center and ED returns within 72 hours were unchanged, while median ED LOS improved from 1.5 to 1.3 hours (p = 0.03).

Twenty-two institutionalized, nondepressed elderly (12 M/10 F, mean age +/- SD: 82.2 +/- 6.4) with probable AD, severe cognitive impairment (MMSE = 4.1 +/- 4.7) and significant behavioral disturbance (Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score > or = 8) were studied. The prolactin (PRL) response to d,l-fenfluramine (60 mg p.o.) was used as an index of central serotonergic function. The NPI aggression score, NPI irritability score, and Behavioral Pathology in AD aggression score were positively correlated to prolactin concentrations following fenfluramine challenge (r(S) =.61, p =.003; r(S) =.53, p =.012; and r(S) =.47, p =.029 respectively). In addition, aggressive patients showed a greater mean PRL increase (% baseline) (215 +/- 60, n = 11) than nonaggressive subjects (123 +/- 54, n = 11) (p =.01, 2-tailed t-test). The change in PRL concentration depended on level of cognitive impairment (p =.0004) and the gender x aggression interaction (p =.015) with the overall regression model accounting for 74% of the variance (r = 0.86, F = 11.9, p =.0001).

Data were from approximately 1200 adults from 465 families assessed as part of a large family and genetic study of OCD. The association of three parenting factors, for fathers and mothers, with offspring OCD status were examined; analyses were stratified by parental OCD status and family loading for OCD (multiplex versus sporadic).	Three factors were derived by principal components factor analysis of the PBI (maternal and paternal care, overprotection and control). Maternal overprotection was associated with OCD in offspring with familial OCD (familial cases) but only if neither parent was affected with OCD, which suggests independent but additive environmental and genetic risk (OR = 5.9, 95% CI 1.2, 29.9, p = 0.031). Paternal care was a protective factor in those not at high genetic risk (sporadic cases) (OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.0, 0.8, p = 0.027). Maternal overprotection was also associated with offspring OCD in sporadic families (OR = 2.9, 95% CI 1.3, 6.6, p = 0.012). The finding that parental overprotection and care were not associated with offspring OCD when at least one parent had OCD addressed directly the hypothesis of maternal or paternal OCD adversely impacting parenting.	This study provides evidence that aspects of parenting may contribute to the development of OCD among offspring.

Voltage clamp and current clamp recordings revealed abnormal bursts of low-amplitude action potentials in 36% of recorded neurons, while large, repetitive inhibitory potentials, mediated by GABAA receptors, were recorded in 90% of the neurons. Thus, prominent findings in this model include abnormalities of both excitatory and inhibitory activity.

However, the role of signaling cascades in this process has not been precisely elucidated. This study was performed to determine the role of signaling cascades involving reactive oxygen species (ROS)/RhoA/PI3K/PKB in increasing the permeability of the BTB induced by NS1619. Using an in vitro BTB model and selective inhibitors of signaling pathways, we investigated whether ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB pathway plays a key role in the process of the increase in BTB permeability induced by NS1619. The results revealed that the BTB permeability was increased and the expression of TJ proteins were significantly decreased by NS1619, and selective inhibitors of identified signaling pathways reversed the observed alterations. Moreover, the significant increases in ROS, RhoA activity, and PKB phosphorylation after NS1619 administration were observed, which were partly inhibited by N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine or C3 exoenzyme or LY294002 pretreatment. The present study demonstrates that the activation of signaling cascades involving ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells was required for the increase in BTB permeability induced by NS1619.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

In this article, we show that the fluorescence lifetime of synthetic dyes covalently attached to amyloid proteins informs on the structural properties of amyloid clusters formed both in vitro and in cells. We demonstrate that the mechanism behind such a ""lifetime sensor"" of protein aggregation is based on fluorescence self-quenching and that it offers a good dynamic range to report on various stages of aggregation without significantly perturbing the process under investigation. We show that the sensor informs on the structural density of amyloid clusters in a high-throughput and quantitative manner and in these aspects the sensor outperforms super-resolution imaging techniques. We demonstrate the power and speed of the method, offering capabilities, for example, in therapeutic screenings that monitor biological self-assembly. We investigate the mechanism and advantages of the lifetime sensor in studies of the K18 protein fragment of the Alzheimer's disease related protein tau and its amyloid aggregates formed in vitro. Finally, we demonstrate the sensor in the study of aggregates of polyglutamine protein, a model used in studies related to Huntington's disease, by performing correlative fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and structured-illumination microscopy experiments in cells.",FLIM| SIM| Self-quenching| amyloid aggregation| super-resolution,In-vitro-study,8,0

Cell nodules of cultures from 3-6 months after ENU exposure were investigated for the presence of organoid structures, signs of differentiation, and differentiation products. Organoid structures were absent as were signs of differentiation into more mature neuroglial cells since a relatively uniform immature cell population was typical for the nodules studied. Nuclear changes in form of nuclear envelope dilatation, margination and condensation of chromatin were present. The S-100 protein was generally expressed by the neuroglial cells in this premalignant phase; GFA and 14.3.2. protein were expressed to a variable degree. The cells showed enhanced proliferation. In conclusion there was a gradual change of differentiation accompanied by the acquisition of atypical nuclear structure in the premalignant phase studied.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Therapeutic progress is also limited by cellular heterogeneity within and between tumors, among other factors such as therapy resistance. To address these challenges, we present an experimental model using human cerebral organoids as a scaffold for patient-derived GBM cell invasion. METHODS: This study combined tissue clearing and confocal microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing of GBM cells before and after co-culture with organoid cells. RESULTS: We show that tumor cells within organoids extend a network of long microtubes, recapitulating the in vivo behavior of GBM. Transcriptional changes implicated in the invasion process are coherent across patient samples, indicating that GBM cells reactively upregulate genes required for their dispersion. Potential interactions between GBM and organoid cells identified by an in silico receptor-ligand pairing screen suggest functional therapeutic targets. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our model has proven useful for studying GBM invasion and transcriptional heterogeneity in vitro, with applications for both pharmacological screens and patient-specific treatment selection on a time scale amenable to clinical practice.",glioblastoma| organoids| single-cell RNA sequencing| tumor cell heterogeneity| tumor invasion,In-vitro-study,8,0

The neuroligin-neurexin adhesion is Ca2+-dependent and regulated by alternative splicing. We report a structure of the complex at a resolution of 2.4 A between the mouse neuroligin-1 (NL1) cholinesterase-like domain and the mouse neurexin-1beta (NX1beta) LNS (laminin, neurexin and sex hormone-binding globulin-like) domain. The structure revealed a delicate neuroligin-neurexin assembly mediated by a hydrophilic, Ca2+-mediated and solvent-supplemented interface, rendering it capable of being modulated by alternative splicing and other regulatory factors. Thermodynamic data supported a mechanism wherein splicing site B of NL1 acts by modulating a salt bridge at the edge of the NL1-NX1beta interface. Mapping neuroligin mutations implicated in autism indicated that most such mutations are structurally destabilizing, supporting deficient neuroligin biosynthesis and processing as a common cause for this brain disorder.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Three clinical forms of Gaucher disease have been described: type 1 as non-neuronopathic, type 2 as acute neuronopathic, and type 3 as subacute neuronopathic. We recently identified a rare mutation (G-->A at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1604) [Choy et al., 1994a, Am J Med Genet 51:156-160] and a novel mutation (T-->G at glucocerebrosidase cDNA nucleotide position 1366) in two type 1 Gaucher patients by sequence analysis of the entire glucocerebrosidase coding region [Choy et al., 1994a, 1994b, Hum Mol Genet 3:821-823]. To demonstrate that these are deleterious and not neutral mutations, we cloned the full-length glucocerebrosidase cDNA of patients and of a normal control in the plasmid vector pAcUW1, recombined the human gene into the Baculovirus genome downstream of its polyhedron p10 promoter, and expressed the inserted gene in cultured cells of Spodoptera frugiperda transfected by recombinant Baculovirus. The levels of residual glucocerebrosidase activity determined in transfected cells with the Gaucher G1604A and T1366G alleles are 6.9% and 2.9% of that expressed by the normal allele (normal = 352.0 nmol/hr/mg protein or 100%). By comparison, the enzyme-specific activity expressed in transfected cells by 2 known Gaucher alleles, A1226G and T1448C, that are prevalent in type 1 and type 2 Gaucher disease are 23.4% and 3.3% of normal. No endogeneous glucocerebrosidase activity was detected in cultured cells transfected by either the wild-type Baculovirus or Baculovirus with the pAcUW1 plasmid vector without the glucocerebrosidase cDNA insert. These findings show that the Baculovirus expression system in cultured Spodoptera frugiperda cells is a suitable system for the functional expression and characterization of the normal and mutant glucocerebrosidase alleles. Moreover, the use of this expression system demonstrates that the G1604A and T1366G mutations are both deleterious mutations resulting in profoundly deficient glucocerebrosidase activity and subsequent Gaucher disease.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
797,18812492,The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics,Chronic benzodiazepine administration potentiates high voltage-activated calcium currents in hippocampal CA1 neurons.,"Signs of physical dependence as a consequence of long-term drug use and a moderate abuse liability limit benzodiazepine clinical usefulness. Growing evidence suggests a role for voltage-gated calcium channel (VGCC) regulation in mediating a range of chronic drug effects from drug withdrawal phenomena to dependence on a variety of drugs of abuse. High voltage-activated (HVA) calcium currents were measured in whole-cell recordings from acutely isolated hippocampal CA1 neurons after a 1-week flurazepam (FZP) treatment that results in withdrawal-anxiety. An approximately 1.8-fold increase in Ca(2+) current density was detected immediately after and up to 2 days but not 3 or 4 days after drug withdrawal. Current density was unchanged after acute desalkyl-FZP treatment. A significant negative shift of the half-maximal potential of activation of HVA currents was also observed but steady-state inactivation remained unchanged. FZP and diazepam showed use- and concentration-dependent inhibition of Ca(2+) currents in hippocampal cultured cells following depolarizing trains (FZP, IC(50) = 1.8 microM; diazepam, IC(50) = 36 microM), pointing to an additional mechanism by which benzodiazepines modulate HVA Ca(2+) channels. Systemic preinjection of nimodipine (10 mg/kg), an L-type (L)-VGCC antagonist, prevented the benzodiazepine-induced increase in alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxasole-4-propionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic current in CA1 neurons 2 days after FZP withdrawal, suggesting that AMPAR potentiation, previously linked to withdrawal-anxiety may require enhanced L-VGCC-mediated Ca(2+) influx. Taken together with prior work, these findings suggest that enhanced Ca(2+) entry through HVA Ca(2+) channels may contribute to hippocampal AMPAR plasticity and serve as a potential mechanism underlying benzodiazepine physical dependence.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Current preclinical GBM models are limited by the lack of a ""normal"" human microenvironment and the inability of many tumor cell lines to accurately reproduce GBM biology. To address these limitations, we have established a model system whereby we can retro-engineer patient-specific GBMs using patient-derived glioma stem cells (GSCs) and human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-derived cerebral organoids. Our cerebral organoid glioma (GLICO) model shows that GSCs home toward the human cerebral organoid and deeply invade and proliferate within the host tissue, forming tumors that closely phenocopy patient GBMs. Furthermore, cerebral organoid tumors form rapidly and are supported by an interconnected network of tumor microtubes that aids in the invasion of normal host tissue. Our GLICO model provides a system for modeling primary human GBM ex vivo and for high-throughput drug screening.",brain tumors| cancer stem cells| cerebral organoids| glioblastoma| glioma| glioma stem cells| human embryonic stem cells| stem-cell-based disease models| tissue engineering| tumor microtubes,In-vitro-study,8,0

Serum from 9 of 19 patients with the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and from 2 of 6 patients with the familial form caused a reduction in the proportion of sprouting terminal axons, as compared with that found in muscles treated with serum from controls or diabetic patients. Immunoglobulin from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, when tested on immunoblots, recognized a 56-kilodalton protein secreted by denervated rat diaphragm muscle; rabbit antiserum raised against this protein also suppressed terminal axonal sprouting. Thus, we have detected an antibody in the serum of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that inhibits sprouting of neurons and subsequent reinnervation of skeletal muscle. Whether this antibody is of primary pathogenic importance or represents a secondary response to neuromuscular destruction is not known. In either case, serum from patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may provide reagents for studies of the trophic communications between muscle and motor neurons.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
800,23240066,PloS one,Contact and encirclement of glioma cells in vitro is an intrinsic behavior of a clonal human neural stem cell line,"Pathotropic neural stem and/or progenitor cells (NSCs) can potentially deliver therapeutic agents to otherwise inaccessible cancers. In glioma, NSCs are found in close contact with tumor cells, raising the possibility that specificity of NSC contact with glioma targets originates in the tumor cells themselves. Alternatively, target preferences may originate, at least in part, in the tumor microenvironment. To better understand mechanisms underlying NSC interactions with glioma cells, we examined NSC-target cell contacts in a highly simplified 3-dimensional peptide hydrogel (Puramatrix) in which cell behaviors can be studied in the relative absence of external cues. HB1.F3 is an immortalized clonal human NSC line extensively characterized in preclinical investigations. To study contact formation between HB1.F3 NSCs and glioma cells, we first examined co-cultures of eGFP-expressing HB1.F3 (HB1.F3.eGFP) NSCs and dsRed-expressing U251 glioma (U251.dsRed) cells. Using confocal microscopy, HB1.F3.eGFP cells were observed contacting or encircling U251.dsRed glioma cells, but never the reverse. Next, examining specificity of these contacts, no significant quantitative differences in either percentages of HB1.F3 NSCs contacting targets, or in the extent of target cell encirclement, were observed when HB1.F3.eGFP cells were presented with various potential target cells (human glioma and breast cancer cell lines, patient-derived brain tumor lines, non-tumor fibroblasts, primary mouse and human astroglial cells, and primary adult and newborn human dermal fibroblasts) except that interactions between HB1.F3 cells did not progress beyond establishing contacts. Finally cytoskeletal mechanisms employed by HB1.F3.eGFP cells varied with the substrate. When migrating in Puramatrix, HB1.F3 NSCs exhibited intermittent process extension followed by soma translocation, while during encirclement their movements were more amoeboid. We conclude that formation of contacts and subsequent encirclement of target cells by HB1.F3 NSCs is an intrinsic property of these NSCs, and that preferential contact formation with tumor cells in vivo must therefore be highly dependent on microenvironmental cues.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
801,27449900,Brain research,MicroRNA-146a down-regulation correlates with neuroprotection and targets pro-apoptotic genes in cerebral ischemic injury in vitro,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate target gene expression, and play an important role in cerebral ischemic injury. MiR-146a has been reported to be highly related to cell invasion, metastasis, immunity, inflammation and apoptosis. Previous studies have indicated that miR-146a can either inhibit or promote apoptosis through different pathophysiological processes. In our previous study, miR-146a in the blood was down-regulated during acute ischemic stroke. However, the connection between miR-146a and acute cerebral ischemic injury and the mechanism underlying the connection remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-146a and its possible target genes in human SK-N-SH cells subjected to 16h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and 12h of reperfusion (OGD/R) injury. Cells were transfected with miR-146a mimic or inhibitor to alter the expression of miR-146a. MiR-146a in the SK-N-SH cells was down-regulated after OGD/R injury. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-146a directly recognized the 3'-UTR of the pro-apoptotic genes, Caspase7 and Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 1 (Bclaf1). Furthermore, miR-146a over-expression effectively decreased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase7 and Bclaf1, and aggravated OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis; in contrast, miR-146a down-regulation was neuroprotective. In conclusion, our study revealed that miR-146a contributes to OGD/R injury in vitro, while negatively regulating the pro-apoptotic genes, Caspase7 and Bclaf1. This special mechanism provides new insight into miRNA regulatory networks. In addition, miR-146a may offer a potential therapeutic approach to cerebral ischemic injury.",Apoptosis| Cerebral ischemic injury| MicroRNA-146a| Oxygen-glucose deprivation and reperfusion,In-vitro-study,8,0
802,28453527,PloS one,Altered nucleocytoplasmic proteome and transcriptome distributions in an in vitro model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,"Aberrant nucleocytoplasmic localization of proteins has been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence suggests that cytoplasmic mislocalization of nuclear proteins such as transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) may be associated with neurotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This study investigated the changes in nucleocytoplasmic distributions of the proteome and transcriptome in an in vitro model of ALS. After subcellular fractionation of motor neuron-like cell lines expressing wild-type or G93A mutant hSOD1, quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. A subset of the results was validated via immunoblotting. A total of 1,925 proteins were identified in either the nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions, and 32% of these proteins were quantified in both fractions. The nucleocytoplasmic distribution of 37 proteins was significantly changed in mutant cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic shifts in 13 and 24 proteins, respectively (p<0.05). The proteins shifted towards the nucleus were enriched regarding pathways of RNA transport and processing (Dhx9, Fmr1, Srsf3, Srsf6, Tra2b), whereas protein folding (Cct5, Cct7, Cct8), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (Farsb, Nars, Txnrd1), synaptic vesicle cycle (Cltc, Nsf), Wnt signalling (Cltc, Plcb3, Plec, Psmd3, Ruvbl1) and Hippo signalling (Camk2d, Plcb3, Ruvbl1) pathways were over-represented in the proteins shifted to the cytoplasm. A weak correlation between the changes in protein and mRNA levels was found only in the nucleus, where mRNA was relatively abundant in mutant cells. This study provides a comprehensive dataset of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the proteome and transcriptome in an in vitro model of ALS. An integrated analysis of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the proteome and transcriptome demonstrated multiple candidate pathways including RNA processing/transport and protein synthesis and folding that may be relevant to the pathomechanism of ALS.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
803,37308987,Acta neuropathologica communications,Mass cytometric analysis of the immune cell landscape after traumatic brain injury elucidates the role of complement and complement receptors in neurologic outcomes.,"Following traumatic brain injury (TBI), a neuroinflammatory response can persist for years and contribute to the development of chronic neurological manifestations. Complement plays a central role in post-TBI neuroinflammation, and C3 opsonins and the anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a) have been implicated in promoting secondary injury. We used single cell mass cytometry to characterize the immune cell landscape of the brain at different time points after TBI. To specifically investigate how complement shapes the post-TBI immune cell landscape, we analyzed TBI brains in the context of CR2-Crry treatment, an inhibitor of C3 activation. We analyzed 13 immune cell types, including peripheral and brain resident cells, and assessed expression of various receptors. TBI modulated the expression of phagocytic and complement receptors on both brain resident and infiltrating peripheral immune cells, and distinct functional clusters were identified within same cell populations that emerge at different phases after TBI. In particular, a CD11c+ (CR4) microglia subpopulation continued to expand over 28 days after injury, and was the only receptor to show continuous increase over time. Complement inhibition affected the abundance of brain resident immune cells in the injured hemisphere and impacted the expression of functional receptors on infiltrating cells. A role for C5a has also been indicated in models of brain injury, and we found significant upregulation of C5aR1 on many immune cell types after TBI. However, we demonstrated experimentally that while C5aR1 is involved in the infiltration of peripheral immune cells into the brain after injury, it does not alone affect histological or behavioral outcomes. However, CR2-Crry improved post-TBI outcomes and reduced resident immune cell populations, as well as complement and phagocytic receptor expression, indicating that its neuroprotective effects are mediated upstream of C5a generation, likely via modulating C3 opsonization and complement receptor expression.",Complement| Complement inhibition| Mass cytometry| Microglia| Neuroinflammation| Traumatic brain injury,In-vitro-study,8,0
804,23727837,Human molecular genetics,Dilysine motifs in exon 2b of SMN protein mediate binding to the COPI vesicle protein α-COP and neurite outgrowth in a cell culture model of spinal muscular atrophy,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disorder that stems from low levels of survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. The processes that cause motor neurons and muscle cells to become dysfunctional are incompletely understood. We are interested in neuromuscular homeostasis and the stresses put upon that system by loss of SMN. We recently reported that α-COP, a member of the coatomer complex of coat protein I (COPI) vesicles, is an SMN-binding partner, implicating this protein complex in normal SMN function. To investigate the functional significance of the interaction between α-COP and SMN, we constructed an inducible NSC-34 cell culture system to model the consequences of SMN depletion and find that depletion of SMN protein results in shortened neurites. Heterologous expression of human SMN, and interestingly over-expression of α-COP, restores normal neurite length and morphology. Mutagenesis of the canonical COPI dilysine motifs in exon 2b results in failure to bind to α-COP and abrogates the ability of human SMN to restore neurite outgrowth in SMN-depleted motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells. We conclude that the interaction between SMN and α-COP serves an important function in the growth and maintenance of motor neuron processes and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SMA.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

However, tPA could induce the intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is the main cause of death in ischemic stroke patient after tPA treatment. At present, there is no treatment strategy to ameliorate tPA-induced brain injury after ischemia. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pre-treated isoflurane, which is a volatile anesthetic and has beneficial effects on neurological dysfunction, brain edema and infarct volume in ischemic stroke model. In this study, we used oxygen/glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) condition to mimic an ischemic stroke in vitro. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity was measured in endothelial cell media. Also, neuronal cell culture was performed to investigate the effect of pretreated isoflurane on the neuronal cell survival after tPA-induced injury during OGD/R. Isoflurane pretreatment prevented tPA-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and suppressed tPA-triggered LRP/NF-κB/Cox-2 signaling after OGD/R. Neuronal cells, incubated with endothelial cell conditioned medium (EC-CM) after tPA + OGD/R, showed upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules. However, neurons incubated with isoflurane-pretreated EC-CM showed increased anti-apoptotic molecules. Our findings suggest that isoflurane pretreatment could attenuate tPA-exaggerated brain ischemic injury, by reducing tPA-induced LRP/NF-κB/Cox-2 in endothelial cells, endothelial MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation, and subsequent pro-apoptotic molecule in neurons after OGD/R.",Tissue-type plasminogen activator| endothelial cell| isoflurane| matrix metalloproteinase| neuronal cell.| oxygen/glucose deprivation,In-vitro-study,8,0

Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, MS is now being explored for biomarker quantitative validation in tissue and biofluids. In this study, we demonstrate the use of MS in both qualitative protein identification and targeted detection of acute TBI biomarkers released from degenerating cultured rat cortical mixed neuronal cells, mimicking intracellular fluid in the central nervous system after TBI. Calpain activation was induced by cell treatment with maitotoxin (MTX), a known calcium channel opener. Separate plates of mixed neuronal-glial culture were subjected to excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and apoptotic inducer staurosporine. Acute TBI biomarkers, GFAP and UCH-L1, were first detected and assessed in the culture media by Western blot. The cell-conditioned media were then trypsinized and subjected to bottom up proteomic analysis. GFAP was readily detected by data-dependent scanning but not UCH-L1. As a proof-of-principle study, rat glia-enriched cell cultures treated with MTX were used to investigate the time-dependent release of GFAP breakdown product by Western blot and for isotope dilution MS absolute quantitation method development. Absolute quantitation of the GFAP release was conducted using the three cortical mixed neuronal cell cultures treated with different agents. Other differentially expressed proteins identified in the glial-enriched and cortical mixed neuronal cell culture models were further analyzed by bioinformatic tools. In summary, this study demonstrates the use of MS in both protein identification and targeted quantitation of acute TBI biomarkers and is the preliminary step toward development of TBI biomarker validation by targeted MS.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
807,26757674,Scientific reports,Interaction of RNA with a C-terminal fragment of the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-associated TDP43 reduces cytotoxicity.,"A hallmark of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a devastating neurodegenerative disease, is formation of inclusion bodies (IBs) from misfolded proteins in neuronal cells. TAR RNA/DNA-binding protein 43 kDa (TDP43) is an ALS-causative protein forming IBs in ALS patients. The relation between localization of the IBs and neurotoxicity remains largely unknown. We characterized aggregation of fluorescently tagged TDP43 and its carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) by analytical fluorescence imaging techniques. Quantitative time-lapse analysis in individual live cells showed that fluorescent-protein-tagged TDP43 was cleaved and a 35 kDa TDP43 CTF (TDP35) formed ubiquitin (Ub)-negative cytoplasmic IBs. Although TDP35 formed mildly toxic Ub-negative IBs in the cytoplasm, TDP25, another type of a TDP43 CTF, efficiently formed sufficiently toxic Ub-positive IBs. One- or two-color fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS/FCCS) revealed that coaggregation of TDP25 with TDP43 was initiated by depletion of the RNA that binds to TDP25. Moreover, nuclear localization tagging TDP25 reduced the rate of neuronal cell death. These observations point to the need to elucidate the novel sequestration mechanism and details of the toxicity of the misfolded and aggregation-prone TDP43 CTFs (as well as the RNA binding and nuclear retention) in order to identify possible preventive interventions against ALS.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

A comparison of the percent DNA synthesis inhibition (assayed by 3H-thymidine uptake 30 min after irradiation), and a 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation determined by flow cytometry placed the AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients in an intermediate position between the normal subjects (with maximum DNA synthesis inhibition and minimum G2 phase accumulation) and the AT homozygotes (with minimum DNA synthesis inhibition and maximum G2 accumulation). The similarity between AT heterozygotes and the NHL patients with respect to the two parameters studied after irradiation was statistically significant. The data indicating a moderate abnormality in the control of cell cycle progression after irradiation in the LCLs and fibroblasts from NHL patients may explain the enhanced cellular and chromosomal radiosensitivity in these patients reported by us earlier. In addition to demonstrating a link between cell cycle abnormality and radiosensitivity as a possible basis for cancer susceptibility, particularly in the NHL patients, the present studies emphasized the usefulness of the assay for 24 h post-irradiation G2 phase accumulation developed by Lavin et al. (1992) in characterizing AT heterozygote-like cell cycle anomaly in cancer patients irrespective of whether they carried the AT gene or any other affecting the cell cycle.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Conditioning of inflammatory cells reflects, at least in part, soluble mediators (such as transforming growth factor β and IL-4) that are released by cancer cells and alter the phenotype of cells of the innate immune system. Signaling pathways in cancer cells that potentiate this activity are incompletely understood. The urokinase receptor (uPAR) is a cell-signaling receptor known to promote cancer cell survival, proliferation, metastasis, and cancer stem cell-like properties. The present findings show that uPAR expression in diverse cancer cells, including breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and glioblastoma cells, promotes the ability of these cells to condition co-cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages so that the macrophages express significantly increased levels of arginase 1, a biomarker of the alternatively activated M2 macrophage phenotype. Expression of transforming growth factor β was substantially increased in uPAR-expressing cancer cells via a mechanism that requires uPA-initiated cell signaling. uPAR also controlled expression of IL-4 in cancer cells via a mechanism that involves activation of ERK1/2. The ability of uPAR to induce expression of factors that condition macrophages in the tumor microenvironment may constitute an important mechanism by which uPAR promotes cancer progression.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Ether à go-go-1 (Eag1) potassium channel and epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1 and ErbB2) have been associated to invasive phenotypes or poor prognosis in cancer patients. However, cells arrange their cytoskeleton in order to acquire a successful migration pattern. We have studied ErbBs and Eag1 expression, and cytoskeleton arrangements in 11 human pituitary adenomas. Eag1, ErbB1 and ErbB2 expression were studied by immunochemistry in tissue and cultured cells. The cytoskeleton arrangement was analyzed in cultured cells by immunofluorescence. Normal pituitary tissue showed ErbB2 expression and Eag1 only in few cells. However, Eag1 and ErbB2 were expressed in all the tumors analyzed. ErbB1 expression was observed variable and did not show specificity for a tumor characteristic. Cultured cells from micro- and macro-adenomas clinically functional organize their cytoskeleton suggesting a mesenchymal pattern, and a round leucocyte/amoeboid pattern from invasive clinically silent adenoma. Pituitary tumors over-express EGF receptors and the ErbB2 repeated expression suggests is a characteristic of adenomas. Eag 1 was express, in different extent, and could be a therapeutic target. The cytoskeleton arrangements observed suggest that pituitary tumor cells acquire different patterns: mesenchymal, and leucocyte/amoeboid, the last observed in the invasive adenomas. Amoeboid migration pattern has been associated with high invasion capacity.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Recently a tissue-specific and selective upregulation of the multidrug efflux transporter ABCB1 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the spinal cord of both patients and the mutant SOD1-G93A mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disease that prevalently kills motor neurons has been reported. Here, we extended the analysis of P-gp expression in the SOD1-G93A ALS mouse model and found that P-gp upregulation was restricted to endothelial cells of the capillaries, while P-gp expression was not detected in other cells of the spinal cord parenchyma such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons. Using both in vitro human and mouse models of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), we found that mutant SOD1 astrocytes were driving P-gp upregulation in endothelial cells. In addition, a significant increase in reactive oxygen species production, Nrf2 and NFκB activation in endothelial cells exposed to mutant SOD1 astrocytes in both human and murine BBB models were observed. Most interestingly, astrocytes expressing FUS-H517Q, a different familial ALS-linked mutated gene, also drove NFκB-dependent upregulation of P-gp. However, the pathway was not dependent on oxidative stress but rather involved TNF-α release. Overall, these findings indicated that nuclear translocation of NFκB was a converging mechanism used by endothelial cells of the BBB to upregulate P-gp expression in mutant SOD1-linked ALS and possibly other forms of familial ALS.

813,1620295,Neurosurgery,Accelerated nonmuscle contraction after subarachnoid hemorrhage: culture and characterization of myofibroblasts from human cerebral arteries in vasospasm,"Cell culture lines from human cerebral arteries showing vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage were established from three autopsy cases. Each culture line showed the ultrastructural characteristics of myofibroblasts. Decreased alpha-actin antigenicity, demonstrated using the anti-smooth muscle cell alpha-actin antibody, was observed in cultured cells possessing abundant F-actin. When incorporated into the three-dimensional collagen matrix in vitro, the cultured cells compacted the collagen lattice at a rate equivalent to that of human dermal fibroblasts. Lattice compaction was significantly accelerated by cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients with symptomatic vasospasm. Compaction was completely inhibited by the addition of 10(-6) mol/L verapamil or 100 U/mL heparin. Neither nimodipine (10(-5) mol/L) nor nicardipine (10(-5) mol/L) inhibited compaction, and endothelin (10(-6) mol/L) and potassium chloride (40 mmol/L) had no effect. The morphological change of cells in the collagen lattice suggests that both verapamil and heparin affect cellular motility, filopodial protrusion, and cell attachment. These data suggest that myofibroblasts in human cerebral arteries differ from medial smooth muscle cells and can generate a force rearranging the proliferated collagen matrix present after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This reorganization can contribute to, or be responsible for, sustained vasoconstriction. Consequently, current treatment for vasospasm may need to be reevaluated to include the nonmuscle components in the vessel wall.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
814,33727594,Scientific reports,Human cerebral organoids as a therapeutic drug screening model for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,"Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD) is a fatal, currently incurable, neurodegenerative disease. The search for candidate treatments would be greatly facilitated by the availability of human cell-based models of prion disease. Recently, an induced pluripotent stem cell derived human cerebral organoid model was shown to take up and propagate human CJD prions. This model offers new opportunities to screen drug candidates for the treatment of human prion diseases in an entirely human genetic background. Here we provide the first evidence that human cerebral organoids can be a viable model for CJD drug screening by using an established anti-prion compound, pentosan polysulfate (PPS). PPS delayed prion propagation in a prophylactic-like treatment paradigm and also alleviated propagation when applied following establishment of infection in a therapeutic-like treatment paradigm. This study demonstrates the utility of cerebral organoids as the first human 3D cell culture system for screening therapeutic drug candidates for human prion diseases.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Ex Schult inhibits CNS enzymes and delays glutamate excitotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via oxidative damage,"One of the most promising approaches to confront the complexity of central nervous system disorders are new multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs). Five medicinal species (Cereus grandiflorus (L.) Mill., Hyssopus officinalis L., Acorus calamus L., Silybum marianum L. Gaertn. and Turnera diffusa Willd. Ex Schult), selected for their ethnopharmacological relevance, were object for in vitro screening. The aqueous extract of T. diffusa revealed the strongest neuroactive potential, inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A (IC(50) = 129.80 ± 11.97 μg/mL), and acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (IC(25) = 0.352 ± 0.011 and 0.370 ± 0.036 mg/mL, respectively). Its phenolic profile was established for the first time by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS(n). Twenty-six out of thirty-seven compounds were newly identified in this species. The pre-treatment with this flavonoid-rich extract promoted a rightward shift of the glutamate concentration neuronal cell (SH-SY5Y) death response curve. Furthermore, it significantly reduced the early phase formation of intracellular reactive species after glutamate and t-BHP exposure, suggesting that neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y cells was, in part, mediated by antioxidant mechanisms.",CNS enzymes| Flavonoids| Glutamate excitotoxicity| Medicinal species| Neuroprotection| Turnera diffusa,In-vitro-study,8,0

817,21055392,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,In yeast redistribution of Sod1 to the mitochondrial intermembrane space provides protection against respiration derived oxidative stress.,"The antioxidative enzyme copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Sod1) is an important cellular defence system against reactive oxygen species (ROS). While the majority of this enzyme is localized to the cytosol, about 1% of the cellular Sod1 is present in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. These amounts of mitochondrial Sod1 are increased for certain Sod1 mutants that are linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). To date, only little is known about the physiological function of mitochondrial Sod1. Here, we use the model system Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate cells in which Sod1 is exclusively localized to the IMS. We find that IMS-localized Sod1 can functionally substitute wild type Sod1 and that it even exceeds the protective capacity of wild type Sod1 under conditions of mitochondrial ROS stress. Moreover, we demonstrate that upon expression in yeast cells the common ALS-linked mutant Sod1(G93A) becomes enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and provides an increased protection of cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress. Such an effect cannot be observed for the catalytically inactive mutant Sod1(G85R). Our observations suggest that the targeting of Sod1 to the mitochondrial IMS provides an increased protection against respiration-derived ROS.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
818,33737669,Scientific reports,Evaluation of UBE3A antibodies in mice and human cerebral organoids,"UBE3A is an E3 ubiquitin ligase encoded by the neurally imprinted UBE3A gene. The abundance and subcellular distribution of UBE3A has been the topic of many previous studies as its dosage and localization has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism, Dup15q syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. While commercially available antibodies have been widely employed to determine UBE3A localization, an extensive analysis and comparison of the performance of different UBE3A antibodies has not been conducted. Here we evaluated the specificities of seven commercial UBE3A antibodies in two of the major experimental models used in UBE3A research, mouse and human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells and tissues. We tested these antibodies in their two most common assays, immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition, we also assessed the ability of these antibodies to capture dynamic spatiotemporal changes of UBE3A by utilizing human cerebral organoid models. Our results reveal that among the seven antibodies tested, three antibodies demonstrated substantial nonspecific immunoreactivity. While four antibodies show specific localization patterns in both mouse brain sections and human cerebral organoids, these antibodies varied significantly in background signals and staining patterns in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

The lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, which occurs at the terminal stage of the viral infection cycle, is considered a critical factor in the development of demyelination and the pathogenesis of PML. However, knowledge is limited about interaction of JCV with oligodendrocytes and its impact on the denudation of axons at the early stage of viral reactivation and prior to the destruction of the infected cells. We have developed an in vitro neuroprogenitor cell culture using human fetal brain that can be differentiated to the oligodendrocyte lineage to investigate interactions of JCV with its host cells. Results show that infection with JCV delays oligodendrocyte maturation as shown by reduced levels of oligodendrocytic markers, including myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α. Furthermore, replication of JCV in these cells caused substantial dysregulation of several chemokines, including CCL5/RANTES, GRO, CXCL1/GROα, CXCL16, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL5/ENA-78, and CXCL10/IP-10, all of which play a role in cell growth and differentiation.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms have been developed to better emulate features of the brain's natural microenvironment. We here use our bioengineered brain-like tissue model, composed of a silk-hydrogel composite, to study the 3D microenvironment's contributions on the development and performance of dopaminergic-like neurons (DLNs). Compared with 2D culture, SH-SY5Y cells differentiated in 3D microenvironments were enriched for DLNs concomitant with a reduction in proliferative capacity during the neurodevelopmental process. Additionally, the 3D DLN cultures were more sensitive to oxidative stresses elicited by the PD-related neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP). MPP induced transcriptomic profile changes specific to 3D-differentiated DLN cultures, replicating the dysfunction of neuronal signaling pathways and mitochondrial dynamics implicated in PD. Overall, this physiologically-relevant 3D platform resembles a useful tool for studying dopamine neuron biology and interrogating molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in PD.",Bioengineered 3D cell culture| Dopaminergic neuron differentiation| Mitochondrial stress| Network biology| Parkinson's disease model| SH-SY5Y| Transcriptomics,In-vitro-study,8,0
821,19155310,Cancer research,ADP-ribosylation factor 6 regulates glioma cell invasion through the IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1-Rac1-mediated pathway.,"A common pathobiological feature of malignant gliomas is the insidious infiltration of single tumor cells into the brain parenchyma, rendering these deadly tumors virtually incurable with available therapies. In this study, we report that ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6), a Ras superfamily small GTPase, is abundantly expressed in invasive human glioma cells. Cellular depletion of ARF6 by small interfering RNA decreased Rac1 activation, impaired HGF-stimulated and serum-stimulated glioma cell migration in vitro, and markedly decreased the invasive capacity of invasive glioma in the brain. Furthermore, ectopic expression of ARF6 in glioma cells promoted cell migration via the activation of Rac1. Upon stimulation of glioma cells with HGF, we show that IQ-domain GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) is recruited and overlaps with ARF6 at the leading edge of migrating cells. However, cellular depletion of ARF6 abrogated this recruitment of IQGAP1 and attenuated the formation of surface protrusions. ARF6 forms complexes with Rac1 and IQGAP1 in glioma cells upon HGF stimulation, and knockdown of IQGAP1 significantly inhibits ARF6-induced Rac1 activation and cell migration. Taken together, these data suggest that ARF6-mediated Rac1 activation is essential for glioma cell invasion via a signaling pathway that requires IQGAP1.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

General subjects,Characterizing the mode of action of extracellular Connexin43 channel blocking mimetic peptides in an in vitro ischemia injury model,"BACKGROUND: Non-selective Connexin43 hemichannels contribute to secondary lesion spread. The hemichannel blocking peptidomimetic Peptide5, derived from the second extracellular loop of the human Connexin43 protein, prevents lesion spread and reduces vascular permeability in preclinical models of central nervous system injury. The molecular mode of action of Peptide5, however, was unknown and is described here. METHODS: Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and APRE-19 cells were used. Scrape loading was used to assess gap junction function and hypoxic, acidic ion-shifted Ringer solution induced ATP release used to assess hemichannel function. Peptide modifications, including amino acid substitutions and truncations, and competition assays were used to demonstrate Peptide5 functional specificity and site of action respectively. RESULTS: Peptide5 inhibits Connexin43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release by acting on extracellular loop two of Connexin43, adjacent to its matching sequence within the protein. Precise sequence specificity is important for hemichannel block, but less so for uncoupling of gap junction channels (seen only at high concentrations). The SRPTEKT motif is central to Peptide5 function but on its own is not sufficient to inhibit hemichannels. Both the SRPTEKT motif and Peptide5 reduce gap junction communication, but neither uncoupling below 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced gap junction coupling at high peptide concentrations appears to be relatively non-specific. However, Peptide5 at low concentrations acts upon extracellular loop two of Connexin43 to block hemichannels in a precise, sequence specific manner. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The concentration dependent and sequence specific action of Peptide5 supports its development for the treatment of retinal injury and chronic disease, as well as other central nervous system injury and disease conditions.",Connexin43| Gap junctions| Hemichannel| Ischemia| Peptide5| Peptidomimetics,In-vitro-study,8,0
823,10762371,The European journal of neuroscience,Free radical production correlates with cell death in an in vitro model of epilepsy.,"Free radical (FR) production, a major step in calcium-dependent neurodegeneration, has been linked to the generation of epileptiform activity and seizure-induced cell death. However, direct evidence of FR production in neurons during seizures has never been presented. Using hippocampal cultured slices we demonstrate that FRs are produced in CA3 but not CA1 pyramidal neurons during the rhythmic synchronous activity induced by the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. The production of FRs (measured as changes in the fluorescence emission of dihydrorhodamine 123) was correlated with an increase in the baseline levels of intracellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) estimated by fluo-3 injected into individual neurons via a patch pipette. [Ca2+]i increased during spike bursting and returned to baseline levels after the burst termination in CA1, but not in CA3, pyramidal neurons where 'interburst' calcium concentrations progressively increased. Measurement of cell death, performed with propidium iodide 48 h after a 30-min exposure to bicuculline, revealed most prominent degeneration of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 pyramidal layer. The FR scavengers vitamin E and glutathione significantly reduced the seizure-induced neurodegeneration without supressing spontaneous epileptiform activity. These observations indicate that FR overproduction is related to seizure-induced neuronal death.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Glioma development is also associated with alteration in the activities and expression of cell cycle regulators, and miRNAs are emerging as important regulators of cell cycle progression. Here, we show that miR-25 is overexpressed in 91% of examined human glioma tissues and 4 out of 6 human glioma cell lines. MiR-25 increases cell proliferation in two independent glioma cell lines. Ectopic expression of miR-25 was found to reduce CDKN1C protein levels by directly targeting its 3'-untranslated region (UTR). Notably, ablation of endogenous miR-25 rescued CDKN1C expression and significantly decreased glioma cell proliferation by facilitating normal cell cycle progression. Our clinical investigation found CDKN1C and miR-25 levels were inversely correlated. Lastly, downregulation of CDKN1 by siRNA blocked the activity of miR-25 on promoting glioma cell proliferation. Overall, our results for the first time show an oncogenic role of miR-25 in human glioma by targeting CDKN1C and that miR-25 could potentially be a therapeutic target for glioma intervention.",CDK| CDKN1C| Cell cycle| Cyclin| Glioma| miR-25,In-vitro-study,8,0

A study on skin, tumour biology and bone metabolism.","Fetal antigen 2 (FA2) was purified from second trimester human amniotic fluid (AF) using immunospecific chromatography, gel filtration and reversed phase chromatography. Amino acid composition and sequence analyses of purified FA2 revealed identity to the amino acid sequence of the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human type I procollagen. Gel filtration of AF as well as purified FA2 demonstrated two molecular forms of FA2, which during gel filtration were elucidated corresponding to MW of approximately 100 kDa and 30 kDa. The molecular forms were referred to as the high molecular component (FA2-HM) and low molecular component (FA2-LM), respectively. SDS-PAGE analysis (reducing and nonreducing conditions) showed a MW of 27 kDa for both FA2-HM and FA2-LM. Mass spectrometry analysis however revealed a MW of 14.343 +/- 3Da. Proteins with collagenous domains often reveal aberrant behaviour both in gel filtration and SDS-PAGE and this phenomenon may account for the apparent higher MW of FA2 observed using these techniques compared to mass spectrometry and amino acid composition/sequence analyses. A polyclonal, monospecific rabbit antibody raised against FA2 was used in immunohistochemical localization studies. Due to the obvious association of FA2 to the BM structure in adult and fetal skin, it was initially referred to as a BM associated component. However, FA2 was immunologically distinct from the well established BM components and moreover, the diffuse distribution of FA2 along the BM differed from linear localization of BM components (e.g. collagen type IV and laminin). The identification of FA2 as the aminopropeptide of the alpha 1 chain of human procollagen type I has the implication that in the immunohistochemical investigations the anti-FA2 may not distinguish between the free propeptide and procollagen type I. In the papillary dermal region of human adult skin type I collagen are arranged in loose fibrils to which the aminoterminal propeptide is still attached. Anti-FA2 may recognize epitopes in the type I procollagen present in this region, giving rise to the diffuse FA2 distribution along the BM. However, whether FA2 also appear as a free component in this region is unknown. In fetal skin where collagen is vividly layed down in the mesenchymal compartment staining with anti-FA2 revealed a diffuse mesenchymal distribution. Demonstration of FA2 within the cytoplasm of proliferating fibroblasts and diffusely in granulation tissue during wound healing suggest that FA2 was involved in the reparative processes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",,In-vitro-study,8,0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of aneurysm embolization by using detachable coils under IVUS guidance. METHODS: IVUS-guided embolization in conjunction with fluoroscopic imaging and subsequently alone were performed in a silicone model with a side wall aneurysm. IVUS-guided embolization in conjunction with fluoroscopic imaging was also used in an in vitro model of a side wall aneurysm created using sheep vessels. The visibility of the aneurysm, microcatheter, and coils ascertained by the IVUS was graded as excellent, good, or poor based on visualization of these items as distinct structures. The agreement between simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images for detecting increasing intra-aneurysmal coil mass and coil prolapse was assessed in 10 and 6 simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images, respectively. RESULTS: IVUS measurements of the aneurysm dimensions strongly correlated with standardized dimensions and measurements acquired by contrast angiography (Pearson coefficient of 0.96 and 0.99 for silicone model and arterial segment model, respectively). IVUS visualization of the aneurysm, microcatheter tip, and coil loops were graded as excellent in the silicone aneurysm model and good in the carotid artery model. The agreement between simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images was very high for detecting increasing intra-aneurysmal coil mass (Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.98) and coil prolapse (83% agreement).

827,27997158,Biochemistry,Chaperone-like Activity of Calnuc Prevents Amyloid Aggregation,"Calnuc is a ubiquitously expressed protein of the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding superfamily. Previous studies have implicated it in Ca(2+)-sensitive physiological processes, whereas details of its function and involvement in human diseases are lacking. Drawing upon the sequence homology of calnuc with calreticulin, we propose it functions as a molecular chaperone-like protein. In cells under thermal, chemical [urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)], and acidic stress, calnuc exhibits properties similar to those of established chaperone-like proteins (GRP78, spectrin, and α-crystallin), effectively demonstrated by its ability to suppress aggregation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, and catalase. Calnuc aids in refolding of MDH with retention of 80% of its enzymatic activity. In HEK293 cells subjected to heat shock, calnuc chaperones luciferase, protecting its activity. Our in vitro and cell culture results establish the ability of calnuc to inhibit fibrillation of insulin and lysozyme and validate its neuroprotective role in cells treated with amyloid fibrils. Calnuc also rescues cells from fibrillar toxicity (caused by misfolded or aggregated proteins), providing a plausible explanation for the previous observation of its low level of expression in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. We propose that calnuc is possibly involved in controlling protein unfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and type II diabetes.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

In previous publications ANA presented excellent in vitro/in vivo efficacy data, especially with fibrin-rich hard clots. We aimed to determine the main physical property responsible for these results, namely suction force versus aspiration flow. METHODS: We evaluated in a bench model the suction force and flow generated by ANA and compared them to other neurovascular catheters combined with a SR (Solitaire). Aspiration flow was evaluated with a flow rate sensor while applying vacuum pressure with a pump. Suction force was determined using a tensile strength testing machine and a purposely designed tool that completely seals the device tip simulating complete occlusion by a hard clot. Suction force was defined as the force needed to separate the device from the clot under aspiration. All experiments were repeated five times, and mean values used for comparisons. RESULTS: Aspiration flow increased with the inner diameter of the device: ANA 1.85±0.04 mL/s, ACE68 3.74±0.05 mL/s, and 8F-Flowgate2 5.96±0.30 mL/s (P<0.001). After introducing the SR, the flow was reduced by an average of 0.57±0.12 mL/s. Due to its larger distal surface, ANA suction force (1.69±0.40 N) was significantly higher than ACE68 (0.26±0.04 N) and 8F-Flowgate2 (0.42±0.06 N) (P<0.001). After introducing the SR, suction force variation was not relevant except for ANA that increased to 2.64±0.41 N. CONCLUSION: Despite lower in vitro aspiration flow, the ANA design showed a substantially higher suction force than other thrombectomy devices.",device| stroke| thrombectomy,In-vitro-study,8,0

Hypoxic injury results in increased neuronal death, which disrupts normal brain development. Although animal model systems have been useful to study the effects of NHI, they do not fully represent the uniqueness and complexities of the human brain. To better understand the effects of hypoxia on human brain development, we have generated a brain organoid protocol and evaluated these cells over the course of 6 months. As anticipated, the expression of a forebrain marker, FOXG1, increased and then remained expressed over time, while there was a transition in the expression of the deep-layer (TBR1) and upper-layer (SATB2) cortical markers. In addition, ventral genes (Eng1 and Nkx2.1) as well as markers of specialized nonneuronal cells (Olig2 and GFAP) also increased at later time points. We next tested the development of our in vitro cerebral organoid model at different oxygen concentrations and found that hypoxia repressed gene markers for forebrain, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and cortical layers, as well as genes important for the migration of cortical neurons. In contrast, ventral markers were either unaffected or even increased in expression with hypoxic insult. Interestingly, the negative effect of hypoxia on the dorsal brain genes as well as oligodendrocytes, and neuronal progenitors could be mitigated by the use of minocycline, an FDA-approved small molecule. Taken together, we have generated a unique and relevant in vitro human brain model system to study diseases such as NHI as well as their potential treatments. Using this system, we have shown the efficacy of minocycline for human NHI.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Although this white matter degeneration is partly attributable to axonopathy associated with neuronal degeneration, amyloid β (Aβ) protein-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes could be another mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of soluble Aβ in oligomeric form on survival and differentiation of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage using highly purified oligodendroglial cultures from rats at different developmental stages. Aβ oligomer at 10 μM or higher reduced survival of mature oligodendrocytes, whereas oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) were relatively resistant to the Aβ oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity. Further study revealed that Aβ oligomer even at 1 μM accelerated 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) formazan exocytosis in mature oligodendrocytes, and, more significantly, inhibited myelin sheet formation after induction of in vitro differentiation of OPCs. These results imply a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying Aβ oligomer-mediated white matter degeneration, which could impair myelin maintenance and remyelination by adult OPCs, resulting in accumulating damage to myelinating axons thereby contributing to neural disconnections.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Immunocytochemistry and Immunoblotting also demonstrated the presence of NSE, but not of glial fibrillary acidic protein or other glial markers. Immunocytochemical studies also indicated the presence of proline hydroxylase, an enzyme found in fibroblasts but not neurons.

As well as mechanical strength and bioadhesiveness of optimized transdermal films of DNP, the impact of dl-limonene concentration in films on DNP in vitro permeation across pig skin was assessed. Attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) measurements were carried out to examine the effects of enhancer on in vitro conformational order of the stratum corneum intercellular lipids following permeation study. Results showed that transdermal formulations of DNP were suitable due to both mechanical and bioadhesive features of the films. In vitro skin permeation study indicated that dl-limonene at a concentration of 3% was optimum with high drug flux.

833,7813676,Experimental brain research,Spontaneous and stimulus-triggered epileptic discharges: delayed antiepileptic effect with triggering.,"The aim of the present study was to test whether the organic calcium channel blocker verapamil acts not only on spontaneously occurring epileptiform field potentials (EFP) but also on EFP triggered by single electrical stimuli in the low-Mg2+ epilepsy model. The experiments were carried out on hippocampal slices of guinea pigs. EFP were elicited by omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate and recorded from stratum pyramidale and stratum radiatum in the CA1 subfield. Single electrical stimuli were applied to the Schaffer collateral pathway. Verapamil was added to the bath solution in concentrations of 40 and 60 mumol verapamil/l at normal (4 mmol/l) and elevated (8 mmol/l) K+ levels. After omission of Mg2+ from the perfusate, spontaneously occurring EFP appeared in all trials. These spontaneously occurring EFP were suppressed dose-dependently upon addition of verapamil to the perfusate. At elevated K+ levels, the latencies to suppression were significantly reduced and the dose dependency was abolished for the two doses of verapamil used. Triggered EFP reappeared upon stimulation after spontaneously occurring EFP had been suppressed, except for trials with 60 mumol verapamil/l bath solution with elevated K+ levels. The stimulus-evoked EFP were abolished with continuing perfusion of verapamil except for trials with 40 mumol/l at normal extracellular K+ concentrations. This effect was again dose dependent and enhanced by elevating the K+ level. In all experiments, stimulus-evoked EFP reappeared upon wash-out of verapamil. A primary action of verapamil on pacemaker functions in epileptogenic tissue is assumed.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
834,34862404,Scientific reports,The novel BET inhibitor UM-002 reduces glioblastoma cell proliferation and invasion,"Bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) proteins have emerged as therapeutic targets in multiple cancers, including the most common primary adult brain tumor glioblastoma (GBM). Although several BET inhibitors have entered clinical trials, few are brain penetrant. We have generated UM-002, a novel brain penetrant BET inhibitor that reduces GBM cell proliferation in vitro and in a human cerebral brain organoid model. Since UM-002 is more potent than other BET inhibitors, it could potentially be developed for GBM treatment. Furthermore, UM-002 treatment reduces the expression of cell-cycle related genes in vivo and reduces the expression of invasion related genes within the non-proliferative cells present in tumors as measured by single cell RNA-sequencing. These studies suggest that BET inhibition alters the transcriptional landscape of GBM tumors, which has implications for designing combination therapies. Importantly, they also provide an integrated dataset that combines in vitro and ex vivo studies with in vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize a novel BET inhibitor in GBM.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
835,30423818,"Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",miR-103/miR-195/miR-15b Regulate SALL4 and Inhibit Proliferation and Migration in Glioma.,"Glioma is the common highly malignant primary brain tumor. However, the molecular pathways that result in the pathogenesis of glioma remain elusive. In this study, we found that microRNA-103 (miR-103), microRNA-195 (miR-195), or microRNA-15b (miR-15b), which all have the same 5' 'seed' miRNA portion and share common binding sites in the SALL4 3'-untranslated region (UTR), were downregulated in glioma tissues and cell lines. These miRNAs suppressed glioma cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, induced cell apoptosis, and decreased the level of the SALL4 protein, but not that of SALL4 mRNA, which was identified as a direct target of all three miRNAs. The caspase-3/7 activity expression in U251 cells overexpressing these miRNAs was rescued during SALL4 upregulation. An obvious inverse correlation was observed between SALL4 and miR-103 or miR-195 expression levels in clinical glioma samples. Moreover, enforced expression of SALL4 stimulated cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. In conclusion, these data suggest that miR-103, miR-195, and miR-15b post-transcriptionally downregulated the expression of SALL4 and suppressed glioma cell growth, migration, and invasion, and increased cell apoptosis. These results provide a potential therapeutic target that may downregulate SALL4 in glioma.",SALL4| glioma| miR-103| miR-15b| miR-195,In-vitro-study,8,0

Focusing on alternative treatment strategies, we evaluated the oncolytic potential of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in malignant glioma cell cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Replication of wildtype and mutant VZV was comparatively analyzed in glioma cell lines (U87, U251 and U373) and in primary malignant glioma cells (n=10) in vitro by infectious foci assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis. Additionally, the tumor-targeting potential of VZV-infected human mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated. RESULTS: VZV replicated efficiently in all the glioma cells studied here followed by rapid oncolysis in vitro. The attenuated vaccine VZV mutant rOKA/ORF63rev[T171] exhibited most efficient replication. Human mesenchymal stem cells were found suitable for targeting VZV to sites of tumor growth. CONCLUSION: VZV exhibits an intrinsic oncolytic potential in malignant glioma cell cultures and might be a novel candidate for virotherapy in glioblastoma multiforme.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

METHODS: Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon guide catheter, were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS: Use of the balloon guide catheter during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the formation of large distal emboli with a diameter >1 mm, regardless of the device used (P<0.01). Applying aspiration via the balloon guide catheter in place of the conventional guide catheter resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P<0.0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69.2 ± 27.3 and 45.5 ± 22.8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional guide catheter was used (1.5 versus 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of distal embolization was significantly reduced with the use of the balloon guide catheter.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

We prepared monovalent, divalent, and trivalent 6-sulfo-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (6S-GlcNAc) immobilized substrates. The morphology and secondary structure of Abeta (1-42) aggregates on the substrates were investigated by dynamic-mode AFM and FTIR-RAS. Abeta (1-42) interactions with multivalent sugars were evaluated by surface plasmon resonance, and the cytotoxicity of Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells was evaluated by MTT assay. Morphological images showed, interestingly, that Abeta (1-42) aggregates had a tendency to form globules rather than fibrils as the valency of 6S-GlcNAc on the substrate was increased. The SPR measurements indicated that this morphological change of Abeta (1-42) was related to the change of binding mode, and the binding mode was dependent on the multivalency of the sugar. Globular Abeta (1-42) was more toxic than fibrillar Abeta (1-42) to HeLa cells. These results suggested that the multivalency of sugars for the amyloidosis of Abeta (1-42) was significant in its morphology and aggregation effects at the surface of the cell membrane mimic.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Previously, we could demonstrate that elevated CGRP plasma levels in a cluster headache bout are normalized after a course of high dose corticosteroids. Here we assess whether MPD suppresses interleukin-1β (IL-1β)- and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced CGRP release in a cell culture model of trigeminal ganglia cells, which could account for the preventive effect in migraine and cluster headache. Metoprolol﻿(MTP), a migraine preventive with a slow onset of action, was used for comparison. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were stimulated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or for 4 h with 10 μM PGE2 following the exposure to 10 or 100 μM MPD or 100 nM or 10 µM MTP for 45 min or 24 h. CGRP was determined by using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: MPD but not MTP blocked IL-1β-induced CGRP release from cultured trigeminal cells. PGE2-stimulated CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cell culture was not affected by pre-stimulation whether with MPD or MTP. CONCLUSION: MPD but not MTP suppresses cytokine (IL-1β)-induced CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cells. We propose that blockade of cytokine mediated trigeminal activation may represent a potential mechanism of action that mediates the preventive effect of MTP on cluster headache and recurrent migraine attacks.",Calcitonin gene related peptide| Cluster headache| Interleukin-1β| Methylprednisolone| Metoprolol| Migraine| Prostaglandin E2| Trigeminal ganglia cells,In-vitro-study,8,0

AIM: The phenotypical and immunocytochemical characterization of primary cell lines from glioblastoma specimens during establishment is of great importance, in order to reliably identify these cell lines as primary glioblastoma cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen primary adherent cell lines out of 34 glioblastoma samples (47%) were established and further characterized. For phenotypical characterization, morphology and growth characteristics of the cells were classified. The cell lines had a high growth rate with a doubling time of 2 to 14 days. Morphologically, the cells displayed spindle-form or polygonal to amorphous shapes and grow as monolayer or in foci without evidence of contact inhibition. The cells were able to migrate and to form colonies. For further characterization, the protein expression of the astrocyte-specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the glial marker S100B, the neuronal marker TUBB3, and malignancy marker VIM, as well as the progenitor markers NES and SOX2, the proliferation marker MKI67, and the fibroblast marker TE7 were determined. Based on the immunocytochemical validation criterion of a coexpression of GFAP and S100B, 15 out of these 16 cell lines (94%) were defined as primary glioblastoma cell lines (pGCL). All 15 pGCL expressed TUBB3 and VIM. NES and SOX2 were stained positively in 13/15 and 6/15 pGCL. MKI67 was expressed in 11/15 and TE7 in 2/15 pGCL. CONCLUSION: These results point out that in self-established primary adherent glioblastoma cell lines, the expression of the specific astrocytic and glial markers GFAP and S100B and of the malignancy and progenitor markers VIM, NES, and SOX2 has to be validated. These data show that primary cell lines of glioblastoma origin with high malignant potential are reliably to establish using standardized validation criteria.",GFAP| glioblastoma| in vitro| primary cell line,In-vitro-study,8,0

We investigated this issue using cell lines from Friedreich's ataxia patients, homozygous for a GAA-repeat expansion in intron 1 of the Frataxin gene. By interphase, FISH we found that in comparison to the normal Frataxin sequence the replication of expanded alleles is slowed or delayed. According to molecular combing, origins never fired within the normal Frataxin allele. In contrast, in mutant alleles dormant origins are recruited within the gene, causing a switch of the prevalent fork direction through the expanded repeat. Furthermore, a global modification of the replication profile, involving origin choice and a differential distribution of unidirectional forks, was observed in the surrounding 850 kb region. These data provide a wide-view of the interplay of events occurring during replication of genes carrying an expanded repeat.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Consequently, development of new compounds capable of preventing tau hyperphosphorylation is an increasingly hot topic. For this reason, dependable in vitro and in vivo models that reflect tau hyperphosphorylation in human diseases are needed. In this study, we generated and validated an in vitro model appropriate to test potential curative and preventive compound effects on tau phosphorylation. For this purpose, a stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell line was constructed over-expressing mutant human tau441 (SH-SY5Y-TMHT441). Analyses of expression levels and tau phosphorylation status in untreated cells confirmed relevance to human diseases. Subsequently, the effect of different established kinase inhibitors on tau phosphorylation (e.g., residues Thr231, Thr181, and Ser396) was examined. It was shown with several methods including immunosorbent assays and mass spectrometry that the phosphorylation pattern of tau in SH-SY5Y-TMHT441 cells can be reliably modulated by these compounds, specifically targeting JNK, GSK-3, CDK1/5, and CK1. These four protein kinases are known to be involved in in vivo tau phosphorylation and are therefore authentic indicators for the suitability of this new cell culture model for tauopathies.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

However, the pathogenesis of AD are very complicated, and the theories of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles cannot explain all pathological alterations and clinical symptoms. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) neural organoids culture derived from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate the pathological mechanisms of AD. In this study, AD cerebral organoids were generated by overexpressing familial AD mutations (APP and PS1 genes) in mouse induced pluripotent stem cells, so that the early pathogenesis of AD could be investigated well with protein and cellular phenotype analyses. The results showed that AD cerebral organoids appeared some AD pathological alterations, and high levels of Aβ and p-Tau were induced as well. Furthermore, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes and glutamatergic excitatory neurons increased significantly, but the number of GABAergic interneurons decreased. In conclusion, we suggest that cerebral organoids are a suitable AD model for scientific study, and that will provide us a novel insight into the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.",3D culture| Alzheimer’s disease| Cerebral organoid| Glutamatergic neuron| Induced pluripotent stem cell,In-vitro-study,8,0

Moreover, α-synuclein content in human cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) represents a PD biomarker candidate. However, capture-based assays for α-synuclein quantification in CSF (such as by ELISA) have shown discrepancies and have limited suitability for high-throughput screening. Here, we describe two sensitive, in-solution, time-resolved Förster's resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET)-based immunoassays for total and oligomeric α-synuclein quantification. CSF analysis showed strong concordance for total α-synuclein content between two TR-FRET assays and, in agreement with a previously characterized 36 h protocol-based ELISA, demonstrated lower α-synuclein levels in PD donors. Critically, the assay suitability for high-throughput screening of siRNA constructs and small molecules aimed at reducing endogenous α-synuclein levels was established and validated. In a small-scale proof of concept compound screen using 384 well plates, signals ranged from <30 to >120% of the mean of vehicle-treated cells for molecules known to lower and increase cellular α-synuclein, respectively. Furthermore, a reverse genetic screen of a kinase-directed siRNA library identified seven genes that modulated α-synuclein protein levels (five whose knockdown increased and two that decreased cellular α-synuclein protein). This provides critical new biological insight into cellular pathways regulating α-synuclein steady-state expression that may help guide further drug discovery efforts. Moreover, we describe an inherent limitation in current α-synuclein oligomer detection methodology, a finding that will direct improvement of future assay design. Our one-step TR-FRET-based platform for α-synuclein quantification provides a novel platform with superior performance parameters for the rapid screening of large biomarker cohorts and of compound and genetic libraries, both of which are essential to the development of PD therapies.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

Given that miRNAs play important roles in regulation of thousands of gene expressions, the effect of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs was investigated to explore the multi-targeting actions of EGCG by using an in vitro SAH model. MTT and western blot assays were used to assess the health effects of EGCG in SAH progression; the results showed that oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)-induced cell proliferation and excessive autophagic activation were significantly inhibited by 50 μM EGCG, but not by 1 μM EGCG. By high throughput sequencing analysis, the miRNA profiles of normal, SAH and EGCG (1 and 50 μM) groups were compared and a total of 953 miRNAs were identified. Of 192 differentially expressed miRNAs, 43 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in SAH (p < 0.01). However, EGCG significantly increased the number of differential expressions of miRNAs, which showed 144 and 138 miRNAs (112 and 115 upregulated, 32 and 23 downregulated, p < 0.01) in 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups, respectively. Among all the differentially expressed miRNAs, 13 miRNAs were shared by the three groups. 5 miRNAs (miR-218-5p, miR-218b, miR-143-3p, miR-101a-3p, miR-30a-3p) were detected in both SAH and EGCG 1 μM groups, and 104 miRNAs were shared by the EGCG 1 μM and EGCG 50 μM groups. Only 1 miRNA (miR-532-5p) was discovered in both SAH and EGCG 50 μM groups. Moreover, 24, 22 and 20 specific differentially expressed miRNAs were discovered in SAH, 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups, respectively. The predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs showed that the most impacted MAPK signaling pathway, particularly the upregulated p38 expression in the SAH group, was restored to the normal level in both EGCG groups, but the calcium signaling pathway was enriched only in the EGCG 50 μM group. These results revealed that differential expression of miRNAs is fundamental to understand the multiple targets actions of EGCG in SAH therapy, and simultaneously targeting more robust signaling pathways could determine the therapeutic effects of EGCG.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

However, it is still unclear whether or how PM alone and in combination with nicotine affects the pathogenesis of PD. We investigated the potential neurotoxicity of PM and the protective properties of nicotine in an in vitro PD model. A 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridimium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity model was established with SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using MTT and TUNEL assays, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using the cell-permeant fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. We investigated mitochondrial apoptotic markers such as Bax, Bcl2, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 and analyzed their levels by Western blotting. SH-SY5Y cells exposed to PM and MPP+ exhibited significantly increased intracellular ROS and decreased cell viability with those exposed to PM alone. PM strikingly exacerbated MPP+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including an increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and the release of cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3. On the other hand, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with nicotine reduced the MPP+-induced loss of cell viability and levels of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling proteins. However, pretreatment with nicotine did not prevent PM-induced toxicity in MPP+-treated SHSY5Y cells. PM and MPP+ synergistically increased ROS levels and mitochondrial apoptosis, which led to SH-SY5Y cell death. The protective effect of nicotine cannot rescue PM-induced synergistic neurotoxicity in the MPP+-induced PD model. Our findings verified the opposing roles of PM and nicotine in a model of PD pathogenesis. A large number of in vivo and in vitro studies would verify the roles of PM and nicotine in the future.",1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridimium (MPP+)| Mitochondrial dysfunction| Nicotine| Oxidative stress| Parkinson's disease| Particulate matter,In-vitro-study,8,0

METHODS: Nine hundred and twelve specimens from a variety of clinical sites, including ocular, mucocutaneous, respiratory and genital material, urines and necropsy tissue, were compared by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and conventional culture for the presence of HSV. RESULTS: The EIA performed to a high level of sensitivity and specificity using a variety of specimen types. Some problems were encountered using cervical swabs from pregnant women and necropsy brain tissue. Analysis of clinical and contact history data of most patients giving discrepant results supported the evidence of recent HSV infection obtained by EIA. The mean culture time was 2.4 days (range one to eight days). CONCLUSIONS: The HSV EIA test performed to a high level of sensitivity (93.7%) and specificity (96.6%) when compared with culture using a variety of clinical material. These results assumed cell culture was 100% sensitive and specific. The actual performance of the EIA test is probably much higher.

848,29142232,Scientific reports,TDP-43 misexpression causes defects in dendritic growth,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD) share overlapping genetic causes and disease symptoms, and are linked neuropathologically by the RNA binding protein TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein-43 kDa). TDP-43 regulates RNA metabolism, trafficking, and localization of thousands of target genes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which dysfunction of TDP-43 contributes to disease pathogenesis and progression remain unclear. Severe changes in the structure of neuronal dendritic arbors disrupt proper circuit connectivity, which in turn could contribute to neurodegenerative disease. Although aberrant dendritic morphology has been reported in non-TDP-43 mouse models of ALS and in human ALS patients, this phenotype is largely unexplored with regards to TDP-43. Here we have employed a primary rodent neuronal culture model to study the cellular effects of TDP-43 dysfunction in hippocampal and cortical neurons. We show that manipulation of TDP-43 expression levels causes significant defects in dendritic branching and outgrowth, without an immediate effect on cell viability. The effect on dendritic morphology is dependent on the RNA-binding ability of TDP-43. Thus, this model system will be useful in identifying pathways downstream of TDP-43 that mediate dendritic arborization, which may provide potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention in ALS/FTD.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

In the present study, we used an in vitro BTB model, a RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) and a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) to determine whether RhoA/ROCK pathway play a role in the process of TJ disassembly, stress fiber formation, MLC and cofilin phosphorylation, as well as increase of BTB permeability induced by EMAP II. The results revealed that BTB permeability was increased by EMAP II induction, and C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 could partially inhibit the EMAP II-induced increase of BTB permeability. The significant down-regulations in tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 and stress fiber formation by EMAP II administration were observed, which were partly prevented by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 pretreatment. Moreover, the significant increases in RhoA activity, myosin light chain (MLC) and cofilin phosphorylation by EMAP II administration were observed, MLC and cofilin phosphorylation were partly inhibited by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 pretreatment. The present study demonstrates that the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling in RBMECs was required for the increase of BTB permeability and these effects are related with the ability for RhoA/ROCK to mediate TJ disassembly and stress fiber formation by phosphorylating cofilin and MLC.",,In-vitro-study,8,0
850,32542379,Nucleic acids research,Full length RTEL1 is required for the elongation of the single-stranded telomeric overhang by telomerase.,"Telomeres cap the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes and distinguish them from broken DNA ends to suppress DNA damage response, cell cycle arrest and genomic instability. Telomeres are elongated by telomerase to compensate for incomplete replication and nuclease degradation and to extend the proliferation potential of germ and stem cells and most cancers. However, telomeres in somatic cells gradually shorten with age, ultimately leading to cellular senescence. Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HHS) is characterized by accelerated telomere shortening and diverse symptoms including bone marrow failure, immunodeficiency, and neurodevelopmental defects. HHS is caused by germline mutations in telomerase subunits, factors essential for its biogenesis and recruitment to telomeres, and in the helicase RTEL1. While diverse phenotypes were associated with RTEL1 deficiency, the telomeric role of RTEL1 affected in HHS is yet unknown. Inducible ectopic expression of wild-type RTEL1 in patient fibroblasts rescued the cells, enabled telomerase-dependent telomere elongation and suppressed the abnormal cellular phenotypes, while silencing its expression resulted in gradual telomere shortening. Our observations reveal an essential role of the RTEL1 C-terminus in facilitating telomerase action at the telomeric 3' overhang. Thus, the common etiology for HHS is the compromised telomerase action, resulting in telomere shortening and reduced lifespan of telomerase positive cells.",,In-vitro-study,8,0

In some severe cases, behavioral, environmental, and pharmacological interventions are not sufficient to alleviate these potentially life-threatening symptoms. It has been suggested that in those cases, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) could be an option. This review summarizes the scientific literature on ECT for agitation and aggression in dementia.	We performed a systematic review in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. A search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. Two reviewers extracted the following data from the retrieved articles: number of patients and their age, gender, diagnoses, types of problem behavior, treatments tried before ECT, specifications of the ECT treatment, use of rating scales, treatment results, follow-up data, and adverse effects.	The initial search yielded 264 articles, 17 of which fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, one was a prospective cohort study, one was a case-control study, and the others were retrospective chart reviews, case series, or case reports. Clinically significant improvement was observed in the majority (88%) of the 122 patients described, often early in the treatment course. Adverse effects were most commonly mild, transient, or not reported.	The reviewed articles suggest that ECT could be an effective treatment for severe and treatment-refractory agitation and aggression in dementia, with few adverse consequences. Nevertheless, because of the substantial risk of selection bias, the designs of the studies reviewed, and their small number, further prospective studies are needed to substantiate these preliminary positive results.",Dementia| aggression| agitation| electroconvulsive therapy,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to review the evidence for the diagnostic clinical features and biomarkers in MCI-LB set out in the criteria. METHODS: MEDLINE, PubMed, and Embase were searched on 9/28/22 for relevant articles. Articles were included if they presented original data reporting the rates of diagnostic features in MCI-LB. RESULTS: Fifty-seven articles were included. The meta-analysis supported the inclusion of the current clinical features in the diagnostic criteria. Evidence for striatal dopaminergic imaging and meta-iodobenzylguanidine cardiac scintigraphy, though limited, supports their inclusion. Quantitative electroencephalogram (EEG) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) show promise as diagnostic biomarkers. DISCUSSION: The available evidence largely supports the current diagnostic criteria for MCI-LB. Further evidence will help refine the diagnostic criteria and understand how best to apply them in clinical practice and research. HIGHLIGHTS: A meta-analysis of the diagnostic features of MCI-LB was carried out. The four core clinical features were more common in MCI-LB than MCI-AD/stable MCI. Neuropsychiatric and autonomic features were also more common in MCI-LB. More evidence is needed for the proposed biomarkers.

However, efficacy varies across populations and cognitive domains, and little is known about the efficacy of CCT in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. METHOD: The authors searched Medline, Embase, PsychINFO, CINAHL, and CENTRAL through July 1, 2016, for randomized controlled trials of CCT in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Overall cognition, individual cognitive domains, psychosocial function, and activities of daily living were pooled separately for mild cognitive impairment and dementia trials. RESULTS: The overall effect on cognition in mild cognitive impairment across 17 trials was moderate (Hedges' g=0.35, 95% CI=0.20-0.51). There was no evidence of publication bias or difference between active- and passive-controlled trials. Small to moderate effects were found for global cognition, attention, working memory, learning, and memory, with the exception of nonverbal memory, and for psychosocial functioning, including depressive symptoms. In dementia, statistically significant effects were found on overall cognition (k=11, g=0.26, 95% CI=0.01-0.52) and visuospatial skills, but these were driven by three trials of virtual reality or Nintendo Wii. CONCLUSIONS: CCT is efficacious on global cognition, select cognitive domains, and psychosocial functioning in people with mild cognitive impairment. This intervention therefore warrants longer-term and larger-scale trials to examine effects on conversion to dementia. Conversely, evidence for efficacy in people with dementia is weak and limited to trials of immersive technologies.",Cognitive Therapy| Dementia-Alzheimer-s Disease,Human-systematic-review,7,0
854,38173220,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Subjective Cognitive Complaints in Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"BACKGROUND: Subjective cognitive complaints (SCCs) in Parkinson's disease (PD) are reported frequently, but their prevalence and association with changes on objective testing are not fully known. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical correlates, and predictive value of SCCs in PD. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. From 204 abstracts, we selected 31 studies (n = 3441 patients), and from these, identified the prevalence, clinical features, associations with neuropsychiatric symptoms, and predictive values of SCCs in PD. RESULTS: The meta-analysis showed an SCC prevalence of 36%. This prevalence, however, was significantly moderated by study heterogeneity regarding female sex, disease severity, levodopa equivalent daily dosage, exclusion from the overall sample of patients with objective cognitive impairment, and measurement instrument. SCC prevalence did not differ between de novo and treated PD patients. SCCs were weakly and negligibly associated with cognitive changes on objective testing in cross-sectional studies. However, in cognitively healthy patients, SCCs had a risk ratio of 2.71 for later cognitive decline over a mean follow-up of 3.16 years. Moreover, SCCs were moderately related to co-occurring symptoms of depression, anxiety, or apathy and were more strongly related to these neuropsychiatric symptoms than objective cognitive functioning. CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that SCCs in patients with and without objective cognitive impairment are frequent, occurring in more than one third of PD patients. Establishing uniform measurement instruments for identifying PD-related SCCs is critical to understand their implications. Even in cases lacking evidence of objective cognitive impairment and where SCCs might reflect underlying neuropsychiatric symptoms, the possibility of later cognitive deterioration should not be excluded. Therefore, SCCs in PD patients warrant close monitoring for opportunities for targeted and effective interventions. © 2024 The Authors.

We identified four different cerebral small vessel diseases and three specific domains of cognitive performance to be considered in the literature search. The analysis contained 14 studies (13 cross-sectional design and one longitudinal design) with 11,502 participants measuring the relationship between uric acid and cerebral small vessel disease. In both continuous and categorical analyses, significant associations were found between hyperuricemia and cerebral small vessel diseases (continuous data: pooled OR: 1.00, 95%CI: 1.00-1.01 and categorical data: pooled OR: 1.42, 95%CI: 1.15-1.75). For the relationship between uric acid and cognitive performance, 19 studies with 49,901 participants were considered, including eight cohort studies, and 11 cross-sectional studies. The cross-sectional data showed that a marginal relationship existed between uric acid and global cognition (β: 0.00, 95%CI: -0.01-0.00). The pooled analysis of cohort studies indicated that higher uric acid had a deleterious effect on attention and executive function (continuous data: β: -0.02, 95%CI: -0.04-0.00 and categorical data: β: -0.03, 95%CI: -0.07-0.00). Conclusion: Our study indicated that a higher level of uric acid had an adverse effect on brain health. Furthermore, a high level of uric acid is related to cognitive decline in attention and executive function, which may exist a long time before the diagnosis of dementia.",Cerebral small vessel disease| Cognitive impairment| Uric acid,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Considering possible risks of intrauterine drug exposure of the child, the role of psychopharmacological treatment is ambiguous and various negative obstetric outcomes were inconsistently associated with medication. Consequently, a critical examination of peri- and postnatal phenomena associated with intrauterine exposure to antidepressants based on serotonin reuptake inhibition (SRI) and subsumed under the term 'poor neonatal adaptation syndrome' (PNAS) is urgently called for.	A comprehensive literature search was conducted, revealing a total number of 33 relevant studies and 69 individual outcomes among 3025 screened studies. Seventeen outcomes allowed meta-analytic evaluation (random effects model). Measures for heterogeneity (I[2]) and contour-enhanced funnel plots were generated.	Single studies showed increased risks for deficits in neurological functioning and autonomous adaptation in SRI exposed infants. Meta-analytical evaluation showed increased symptom occurrence or severity in exposed neonates for low APGAR scores, birth weight, size for gestational age, preterm delivery, neuromuscular and autonomous regulation, and higher rates of admission to specialized care. Mostly, increased risk after SRI exposure was supported by comparison to unexposed infants born to mothers diagnosed with depression.	Whereas statistically significant evidence for various effects of intrauterine exposure to SRI was found, the clinical relevance remains unresolved because of inherently low data quality in this research domain and insufficiently defined samples and outcomes. More systematic research under ethical considerations is required to improve multiprofessional counseling in the many women dealing with MDD during pregnancy and the peripartum.",PNAS| depression| meta analysis| poor neonatal adaption| pregnancy| serotonin reuptake inhibitors,Human-systematic-review,7,0
857,33011431,Archives of gerontology and geriatrics,Sarcopenia and frailty in individuals with dementia: A systematic review,"BACKGROUND: Population aging has resulted in an increase in age-related conditions. Sarcopenia, the progressive loss of muscle mass and strength, and frailty, vulnerability to poor resolution of homeostasis after a stressor, are common causes of functional decline in older individuals. There is a paucity of work on how they interrelate with dementia. The objective of this review was to examine the literature on sarcopenia and frailty in dementia. METHODS AND RESULTS: Studies of sarcopenia and frailty in dementia were searched for in EMBASE, PubMed and Web of Science, and via hand-searching. Citations were screened for independently by two reviewers, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. To be eligible for inclusion, the articles needed to fulfil: (1) English language; (2) human studies; and (3) full-text available. Dementia of any aetiology was included. 303 non-duplicate recorders were identified, of which 270 irrelevant papers were excluded. Of the remaining 33, 27 examined frailty and 13 sarcopenia, with six of these measuring both. An increased prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia was noted in dementia patients. However, nine papers did not specify dementia aetiologies. Of those that did (n = 21), 20 examined Alzheimer's disease, with three also including Lewy body dementia, three vascular dementia, and one Parkinson's disease dementia. CONCLUSION: Most papers examined frailty, rather than sarcopenia, in dementia. The studies were heterogeneous, using different protocols and non-validated definitions. However, dementia patients may have an increased prevalence of frailty and sarcopenia. This review highlights key gaps in accurate diagnosis of frailty/sarcopenia and in non-Alzheimer's dementia.",Aging| Alzheimer’s| Dementia| Frailty| Lewy bodies| Sarcopenia,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The study's objective is to review the impact of interim opioid agonist treatment (OAT), a short-term approach for patients awaiting standard OAT, in terms of treatment retention, access to standard OAT, quality of life and satisfaction with treatment.	We conducted a systematic review searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL up to May 2020. Due to variability between studies and outcome measurements, we did not pool effect estimates and reported a narrative synthesis of findings rating their certainty according to GRADE.	We identified 266 unique records and included five randomized trials with some limitations in risk of bias and one observational study limited by selection bias. The studies assessed similar approaches to interim OAT but were compared to three different control conditions. Four studies reported on treatment retention at 4 months or less with no significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list or standard OAT. Two studies reported treatment retention at 12 months with no differences between interim OAT and standard OAT. Two trials assessed access to standard OAT and showed significant differences between interim OAT and waiting list for standard OAT. We rated the quality of evidence for these outcomes as moderate due to the impact of risk of bias. Data on quality of life or satisfaction with treatment was suboptimal.	Interim OAT is likely more effective than a waiting list for standard OAT in access to treatment, and it is probably as effective as standard OAT regarding treatment retention.

Embase, PubMed, Wiley/Cochrane Library, and Ebsco/CINAHL were searched from inception up to May 16, 2018.	We included randomized controlled trials comparing upper limb BoNT injections with a control intervention in patients with a history of stroke. A total of 1212 unique records were screened by 2 independent reviewers. Forty trials were identified, including 2718 patients with history of stroke.	Outcome data were pooled according to assessment timing (ie, 4-8wk and 12wk after injection), and categorized into 6 main clinical goals (ie, spasticity-related pain, involuntary movements, passive joint motion, care ability, arm and hand use, and standing and walking performance). Sensitivity analyses were performed for the influence of study and intervention characteristics, involvement of pharmaceutical industry, and publication bias.	Robust evidence is shown for the effectiveness of BoNT in reducing resistance to passive movement, as measured with the (Modified) Ashworth Score, and improving self-care ability for the affected hand and arm after intervention (P<.005) and at follow-up (P<.005). In addition, robust evidence is shown for the absence of effect on arm-hand capacity at follow-up. BoNT was found to significantly reduce involuntary movements, spasticity-related pain, and caregiver burden, and improve passive range of motion, while no evidence was found for arm and hand use after intervention.	In view of the robustness of current evidence, no further trials are needed to investigate BoNT for its favorable effects on resistance to passive movement of the spastic wrist and fingers, and on self-care. No trials are needed to further confirm the lack of effects of BoNT on arm-hand capacity, whereas additional trials are needed to establish the suggested favorable effects of BoNT on other body functions, which may result in clinically meaningful outcomes at activity and participation levels.",Botulinum toxins| Meta-analysis| Muscle spasticity| Rehabilitation| Stroke,Human-systematic-review,7,0
860,25093383,International psychogeriatrics,The art of successful implementation of psychosocial interventions in residential dementia care: a systematic review of the literature based on the RE-AIM framework.,"In the past decades many psychosocial interventions for elderly people with dementia have been developed and implemented. Relatively little research has been done on the extent to which these interventions were implemented in the daily care. The aim of this study was to obtain insight into strategies for successful implementation of psychosocial interventions in the daily residential dementia care. Using a modified RE-AIM framework, the indicators that are considered important for effective and sustainable implementation were defined.	A systematic literature search was undertaken in PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cinahl, followed by a hand search for key papers. The included publications were mapped based on the dimensions of the RE-AIM framework: Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance.	Fifty-four papers met the inclusion criteria and described various psychosocial interventions. A distinction was made between studies that used one and studies that used multiple implementation strategies. This review shows that to improve their knowledge, caregivers needed at least multiple implementation strategies, only education is not enough. For increasing a more person-centered attitude, different types of knowledge transfer can be effective. Little consideration is given to the adoption of the method by caregivers and to the long-term sustainability (maintenance).	This review shows that in order to successfully implement a psychosocial method the use of multiple implementation strategies is recommended. To ensure sustainability of a psychosocial care method in daily nursing home care, innovators as well as researchers should specifically pay attention to the dimensions Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance of the RE-AIM implementation framework.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The search date ended in February 2012. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) by taking acupuncture as the main treatment for VMCI (nonvascular dementia) were collected. Results were measured using at least one internationally recognized evaluation cognitive scale. Two analysts selected the data independently. The assessment of methodological quality was based on the Cochrane Handbook and the data were analyzed by using RevMan 5.1.0 Software. The mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) were taken and graphed with 95% confidence interval (CI).	Recruited 12 RCTs included a total of 691 cases meeting the inclusion criteria (all of the methodological quality was of B level). Acupuncture combined other therapies was involved in 9 RCTs, with effect compared with that of other therapies. Results of meta-analysis showed, compared with the cognitive function training alone, electroacupuncture (MD 1.59, 95% CI 0.69-2.48, P = 0.0005, 3 studies) or body acupuncture (MD 3.26, 95% CI 1.69-4.83, P < 0.01, 1 study) combined with the cognitive function training could significantly increase the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score of patients. In comparison to Western medicine, acupuncture could elevate ADAS-Cog score (MD 2.16, 95% CI 1.36-2.95, P < 0.01, 3 studies). In all the studies, adverse event had not been reported.	Acupuncture in combination with other therapies could significantly improve cognitive functions.

862,36097997,The lancet. Healthy longevity,Mortality rates in Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's dementias: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: People with dementia die prematurely. Identifying differences in mortality rates between different types of dementia might aid in the development of preventive interventions for the most vulnerable populations. The aim of this study was to compare the difference in mortality rates between individuals without dementia and individuals with various types of dementia. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analysis, we did a systematic search of MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from inception to July 11, 2020, for cross-sectional or cohort studies that assessed mortality and survival-related outcomes among people with different types of dementia compared with people without dementia. Single-arm studies without comparison groups and autopsy studies or family studies that used a selected sample were excluded. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used by two authors (D-JL and C-SC) independently to measure the methodological quality of included studies, and two authors (F-CY and P-TT) independently extracted data. We assessed differences in all-cause mortality rate and survival time from dementia diagnosis between individuals without dementia, individuals with Alzheimer's disease, and individuals with non-Alzheimer's disease dementias. The secondary outcomes were age at death and survival time from disease onset. Random-effects meta-analyses were done. Effect sizes included hazard ratios (HRs) and mean differences (MDs) with 95% CIs. Potential moderators, including age-associated moderators, were identified through meta-regression and subgroup analyses. This study is registered with PROSPERO, CRD42020198786. FINDINGS: Our database search identified 11 973 records, and we included 78 eligible studies in our analyses, encompassing 63 125 individuals with dementia and 152 353 controls. Individuals with any type of dementia had a higher mortality rate than individuals without dementia (HR 5·90, 95% CI 3·53 to 9·86), and the HR for all-cause mortality was highest for Lewy body dementia (17·88, 5·87 to 54·46). After diagnosis, the mean survival time for people with Alzheimer's disease was 5·8 years (SD 2·0). Compared with people with Alzheimer's disease, a diagnosis of any non-Alzheimer's disease dementia was associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality (HR 1·33, 1·21 to 1·46), a shorter survival time from diagnosis (MD -1·12 years, 95% CI -1·52 to -0·72), and a younger age at death (-1·76 years, -2·66 to -0·85). Survival time from disease onset was also shorter in people with non-Alzheimer's dementia, across types, compared with people with Alzheimer's disease, but the subgroup analysis revealed that this difference was only significant for vascular dementia (MD -1·27 years, -1·90 to -0·65) and dementia with Lewy bodies (MD -1·06 years, -1·68 to -0·44). The interactions between age and several survival-related outcomes were significant. 39 (50%) of the 78 included studies were rated as good quality, and large heterogeneity (I(2)>75%) was observed for most of the study outcomes. INTERPRETATION: Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia and one of the major causes of mortality worldwide. However, the findings from the current study suggest that non-Alzheimer's disease dementias were associated with higher morality rates and shorter life expectancy than Alzheimer's disease. Developing tailored treatment and rehabilitation programmes for different types of dementia is important for mental health providers, patients, and their families.

863,31471958,Journal of medical Internet research,"Current State of Digital Biomarker Technologies for Real-Life, Home-Based Monitoring of Cognitive Function for Mild Cognitive Impairment to Mild Alzheimer Disease and Implications for Clinical Care: Systematic Review","BACKGROUND: Among areas that have challenged the progress of dementia care has been the assessment of change in symptoms over time. Digital biomarkers are defined as objective, quantifiable, physiological, and behavioral data that are collected and measured by means of digital devices, such as embedded environmental sensors or wearables. Digital biomarkers provide an alternative assessment approach, as they allow objective, ecologically valid, and long-term follow-up with continuous assessment. Despite the promise of a multitude of sensors and devices that can be applied, there are no agreed-upon standards for digital biomarkers, nor are there comprehensive evidence-based results for which digital biomarkers may be demonstrated to be most effective. OBJECTIVE: In this review, we seek to answer the following questions: (1) What is the evidence for real-life, home-based use of technologies for early detection and follow-up of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia? And (2) What transformation might clinicians expect in their everyday practices? METHODS: A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, and Scopus databases for papers published from inception to July 2018. We searched for studies examining the implementation of digital biomarker technologies for mild cognitive impairment or mild Alzheimer disease follow-up and detection in nonclinic, home-based settings. All studies that included the following were examined: community-dwelling older adults (aged 65 years or older); cognitively healthy participants or those presenting with cognitive decline, from subjective cognitive complaints to early Alzheimer disease; a focus on home-based evaluation for noninterventional follow-up; and remote diagnosis of cognitive deterioration. RESULTS: An initial sample of 4811 English-language papers were retrieved. After screening and review, 26 studies were eligible for inclusion in the review. These studies ranged from 12 to 279 participants and lasted between 3 days to 3.6 years. Most common reasons for exclusion were as follows: inappropriate setting (eg, hospital setting), intervention (eg, drugs and rehabilitation), or population (eg, psychiatry and Parkinson disease). We summarized these studies into four groups, accounting for overlap and based on the proposed technological solutions, to extract relevant data: (1) data from dedicated embedded or passive sensors, (2) data from dedicated wearable sensors, (3) data from dedicated or purposive technological solutions (eg, games or surveys), and (4) data derived from use of nondedicated technological solutions (eg, computer mouse movements). CONCLUSIONS: Few publications dealt with home-based, real-life evaluations. Most technologies were far removed from everyday life experiences and were not mature enough for use under nonoptimal or uncontrolled conditions. Evidence available from embedded passive sensors represents the most relatively mature research area, suggesting that some of these solutions could be proposed to larger populations in the coming decade. The clinical and research communities would benefit from increasing attention to these technologies going forward.",Alzheimer disease| cognition disorders| dementia| digital biomarkers| digital health| digital phenotyping| older adults| technology,Human-systematic-review,7,0
864,28103414,Journal of traumatic stress,A Meta-Analysis of the Association Between Appraisals of Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents.,"Cognitive models of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) place an emphasis on the role of negative appraisals of traumatic events. It is suggested that the way in which the event is appraised determines the extent to which posttraumatic stress symptoms will be experienced. Therefore, a strong relationship between trauma appraisals and symptoms of PTSD might be expected. However, this relationship is not as firmly established in the child and adolescent literature. A systematic literature review of this relationship returned 467 publications, of which 11 met full eligibility criteria. A random effects meta-analysis revealed a large effect size for the relationship between appraisals and PTSD symptoms in children and adolescents, r = .63, 95% CI [.58, .68], Z = 17.32, p < .001, with significant heterogeneity present. A sensitivity analysis suggested that this relationship was not contingent on 1 specific measure of appraisals. Results were consistent with the cognitive behavioral theory of PTSD, demonstrating that appraisals of trauma are strongly related to posttraumatic stress in children and adolescents. However, this relationship was not observed in a sample of 4- to 6-year-olds, indicating that further research is required to explicate cognitive processing of trauma in very young children.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The lowest median adherence was observed with surgical management (14%), whereas the highest was observed with oxygenation (100%), steroid (97.8%), and blood pressure recommendation (92.3%). Variability was primarily explained by the variation in the strength of evidence of each recommendation. Treating patients with higher severity of injury as well as treatment in a Level I trauma center positively influenced adherence. Overall, adherence to BTF guidelines varies.

866,36976794,PLoS medicine,Prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke: A systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"Depression is the most frequent psychiatric condition after stroke and is associated with negative health outcomes. We aim to undertake a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prevalence and natural history of depression after stroke.	Studies published up to 4 November 2022 on Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, and Web of Science Core Collection were searched. We included studies of adults with stroke, where depression was assessed at a prespecified time point. Studies excluding people with aphasia and history of depression are excluded. Critical Appraisal Skills Programme(CASP) cohort study tool was used to assess risk of bias. A total of 77 studies were included in the pooled estimates of the prevalence of poststroke depression (PSD). The overall prevalence of depression was 27% (95% CI 25 to 30). Prevalence of depression was 24% (95% CI 21 to 28) by clinical interview and 29% (95% CI 25 to 32) by rating scales. Twenty-four studies with more than one assessment time point reported the natural history of PSD. Among people who were depressed within 3 months of stroke, 53% (95% CI 47 to 59) experienced persistent depression, while 44% (95% CI 38 to 50) recovered. The incidence of later depression (3 to 12 months after stroke) was 9% (95% CI 7 to 12). The cumulative incidence during 1 year after stroke was 38% (95% CI 33 to 43), and the majority (71% (95% CI 65 to 76)) of depression had onset within 3 months after stroke. The main limitation of the present study is that excluding people in source studies with severe impairments may produce imprecise estimates of the prevalence of PSD.	In this study, we observed that stroke survivors with early-onset depression (within 3 months after stroke) are at high risks for remaining depressed and make up two-thirds of the incident cases during 1 year after stroke. This highlights the need for ongoing clinical monitoring of patients depressed shortly after stroke.	PROSPERO CRD42022314146.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
867,10796586,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Lecithin for dementia and cognitive impairment,"BACKGROUND: People with Alzheimer's disease have been found to have a relative lack of the enzyme responsible for converting choline into acetylcholine within the brain. Lecithin is a major dietary source of choline, so extra consumption may assist in the production of acetylcholine and reduce some of the symptoms of dementia. OBJECTIVES: To determine the efficacy of lecithin in the treatment of dementia or cognitive impairment. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Impairment Group Register of Clinical Trials has been searched, as have the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, Psychlit, ISI and Current Contents. Reference lists and relevant books have been examined. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, randomised trials comparing lecithin with placebo in a treatment period longer than one day, in patients with dementia of the Alzheimer type, vascular dementia, mixed vascular and Alzheimer's disease, unclassified or other dementia or unclassified cognitive impairment not fulfilling the criteria for dementia are eligible for inclusion. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data are extracted by two independent reviewers and cross checked. Meta-analyses are performed when more than one trial provide data on a comparable outcome on sufficiently similar patients. Random effects analyses are performed whenever heterogeneity between results appears to be present. Standardised mean difference are used due do the use of different scales and periods of treatment. Odds ratios for dichotomous data are pooled using the Mantel-Haenszel or DerSimonian and Laird methods. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven randomised trials have been identified involving patients with Alzheimer's disease (265 patients) and Parkinsonian dementia (21 patients). No trials reported any clear clinical benefit of lecithin. Few trials contributed data to meta-analyses. The only statistically significant result was in favour of placebo for adverse events, based on one trial, which appears likely to be a spurious result. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from randomised trials does not support the use of lecithin in the treatment of patients with dementia or cognitive impairment. A moderate effect cannot be ruled out, but results from the small trials to date do not indicate priority for a large randomised trial.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
868,30033623,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia,"BACKGROUND: Dementia is a clinical syndrome with a number of different causes which is characterised by deterioration in cognitive, behavioural, social and emotional functions. Pharmacological interventions are available but have limited effect to treat many of the syndrome's features. Less research has been directed towards non-pharmacological treatments. In this review, we examined the evidence for effects of music-based interventions. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of music-based therapeutic interventions for people with dementia on emotional well-being including quality of life, mood disturbance or negative affect, behavioural problems, social behaviour and cognition at the end of therapy and four or more weeks after the end of treatment. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG) on 19 June 2017 using the terms: music therapy, music, singing, sing, auditory stimulation. Additional searches were carried out on 19 June 2017 in the major healthcare databases MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS; and in trial registers and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials of music-based therapeutic interventions (at least five sessions) for people with dementia that measured any of our outcomes of interest. Control groups either received usual care or other activities with or without music. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors worked independently to screen the retrieved studies against the inclusion criteria and then to extract data and assess methodological quality of the included studies. If necessary, we contacted trial authors to ask for additional data, including relevant subscales, or for other missing information. We pooled data using random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: We included 22 studies with 1097 randomised participants. Twenty-one studies with 890 participants contributed data to meta-analyses. Participants in the studies had dementia of varying degrees of severity, and all were resident in institutions. Seven studies delivered an individual music intervention; the other studies delivered the intervention to groups of participants. Most interventions involved both active and receptive musical elements. The methodological quality of the studies varied. All were at high risk of performance bias and some were at high risk of detection or other bias.At the end of treatment, we found low-quality evidence that the interventions may improve emotional well-being and quality of life (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 0.62; 9 studies, 348 participants) and reduce anxiety (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.72 to -0.14; 13 studies, 478 participants). We found low-quality evidence that music-based therapeutic interventions may have little or no effect on cognition (SMD 0.15, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.36; 7 studies, 350 participants). There was moderate-quality evidence that the interventions reduce depressive symptoms (SMD -0.27, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.09; 11 studies, 503 participants) and overall behaviour problems (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.01; 10 studies, 442 participants), but do not decrease agitation or aggression (SMD -0.07, 95% CI -0.24 to 0.10; 14 studies, 626 participants). The quality of the evidence on social behaviour was very low, so effects were very uncertain.The evidence for long-term outcomes measured four or more weeks after the end of treatment was of very low quality for anxiety and social behaviour, and for the other outcomes, it was of low quality for little or no effect (with small SMDs, between 0.03 and 0.34). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Providing people with dementia who are in institutional care with at least five sessions of a music-based therapeutic intervention probably reduces depressive symptoms and improves overall behavioural problems at the end of treatment. It may also improve emotional well-being and quality of life and reduce anxiety, but may have little or no effect on agitation or aggression or on cognition. We are uncertain about effects on social behaviour and about long-term effects. Future studies should examine the duration of effects in relation to the overall duration of treatment and the number of sessions.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
869,27343888,Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,Transported Versus Homegrown Parenting Interventions for Reducing Disruptive Child Behavior: A Multilevel Meta-Regression Study.,"Children's disruptive behavior problems place children at high risk for oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, and carry a high burden for individuals and society. Policy makers and service providers aiming to reduce children's disruptive behavior problems must often choose between importing an intervention developed abroad or instead developing or using a 'homegrown' (i.e., local) intervention. No comprehensive comparison of these interventions exists.	We performed a multilevel meta-regression of 129 randomized trials (374 effect sizes) of transported and homegrown parenting interventions. We identified trials by searching the included trials lists of systematic reviews, found through searches in 6 databases (e.g., MEDLINE, EMBASE). Trials that had not yet been reviewed were found by searching the same databases. Primary outcome was the mean difference in effectiveness between transported and homegrown interventions to reduce disruptive child behavior. We also compared this differential effectiveness for various intervention 'brands' (e.g., Incredible Years and Triple P Positive Parenting Program) and geographical regions (e.g., North America and Europe).	Transported and homegrown interventions did not differ in their effectiveness to reduce disruptive child behavior (d = 0.10, not significant). Results were robust across intervention brands and geographical regions. Six trials on transported interventions in Hong Kong, Iran, and Panama suggest promising results for transporting interventions to 'nonwestern' countries, whereas one trial in Indonesia does not.	Parenting interventions based on the same principles led to similar outcomes, whether transported or homegrown. This finding supports the selection of interventions based on their evidence base rather than on cultural specificity.",disruptive behavior problems| multilevel meta-regression| parenting intervention| randomized controlled trial| transportability,Human-systematic-review,7,0
870,37271132,Dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders,The Utility of Visual and Spatial Perception Tests in Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review.,"Visual and spatial perception (VSP) are cognitive domains frequently assessed in the screening and neuropsychological assessment of dementia. Evidence suggests that VSP impairment is common in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite this evidence, the ability of VSP tests to discriminate between healthy older adults and people with AD remains mixed. The purpose of this literature review was to employ a systematic search strategy to identify empirical evidence supporting the diagnostic utility of VSP tests which may be used in the screening and diagnosis of AD.	Specified criteria were used to perform a systematic literature search of the PsycINFO and PubMed databases with no date restrictions. Relevant data from the selected studies were extracted, and a published appraisal tool (the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2) was used to evaluate methodological quality.	Of the 144 articles returned, six studies and 11 VSP tests met review inclusion criteria. Four tests demonstrated both sensitivity and specificity values above 80%. A computerised 3D Visual Task demonstrated the highest sensitivity and specificity values (90% and 95%, respectively). The quality of the identified studies was considered to be satisfactory. Identified limitations and the implications of issues relating to study methodology are discussed, and recommendations for future research are suggested.	The evidence from this review suggests that certain tests of VSP may be a useful addition to the routine screening of AD.",Alzheimer’s disease| Cognitive tests| Diagnostic accuracy| Systematic review| Visual and spatial perception,Human-systematic-review,7,0
871,26301526,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Animal derived surfactant extract versus protein free synthetic surfactant for the prevention and treatment of respiratory distress syndrome.,"A wide variety of surfactant preparations have been developed and tested including synthetic surfactants and surfactants derived from animal sources. Although clinical trials have demonstrated that both synthetic surfactant and animal derived surfactant preparations are effective, comparison in animal models has suggested that there may be greater efficacy of animal derived surfactant products, perhaps due to the protein content of animal derived surfactant.	To compare the effect of animal derived surfactant to protein free synthetic surfactant preparations in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).	Searches were updated of the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2014), PubMed, CINAHL and EMBASE (1975 through November 2014). All languages were included.	Randomized controlled trials comparing administration of protein free synthetic surfactants to administration of animal derived surfactant extracts in preterm infants at risk for or having respiratory distress syndrome were considered for this review.	Data collection and analysis were conducted according to the standards of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group.	Fifteen trials met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis showed that the use of animal derived surfactant rather than protein free synthetic surfactant resulted in a significant reduction in the risk of pneumothorax [typical relative risk (RR) 0.65, 95% CI 0.55 to 0.77; typical risk difference (RD) -0.04, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.02; number needed to treat to benefit (NNTB) 25; 11 studies, 5356 infants] and a marginal reduction in the risk of mortality (typical RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.04 to -0.00; NNTB 50; 13 studies, 5413 infants).Animal derived surfactant was associated with an increase in the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis [typical RR 1.38, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.76; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.04; number needed to treat to harm (NNTH) 50; 8 studies, 3462 infants] and a marginal increase in the risk of any intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.15; typical RD 0.02, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.05; 10 studies, 5045 infants) but no increase in Grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage (typical RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.27; typical RD 0.01, 95% CI -0.01 to 0.03; 9 studies, 4241 infants).The meta-analyses supported a marginal decrease in the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia or mortality associated with the use of animal derived surfactant preparations (typical RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.00; typical RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.00; 6 studies, 3811 infants). No other relevant differences in outcomes were noted.	Both animal derived surfactant extracts and protein free synthetic surfactant extracts are effective in the treatment and prevention of respiratory distress syndrome. Comparative trials demonstrate greater early improvement in the requirement for ventilator support, fewer pneumothoraces, and fewer deaths associated with animal derived surfactant extract treatment. Animal derived surfactant may be associated with an increase in necrotizing enterocolitis and intraventricular hemorrhage, though the more serious hemorrhages (Grade 3 and 4) are not increased. Despite these concerns, animal derived surfactant extracts would seem to be the more desirable choice when compared to currently available protein free synthetic surfactants.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The meta-analysis included randomized controlled trials of memantine for Lewy body disorders in all patients with Lewy body disorders. Motor function, activities of daily living, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, Mini-Mental State Exam, discontinuation rate, and individual side effects were evaluated.	No significant effects of memantine on motor function scores, Mini-Mental State Exam scores, Neuropsychiatric Inventory scores, and activity of daily living scores were found. However, memantine was superior to placebo in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Clinical Global Impression of Change scores (standardized mean difference: -0.26; 95% confidence interval: -0.51 to -0.02; z = 2.08; p = 0.04; two studies; N = 258). Dropout due to all causes, inefficacy, or adverse events were similar in both groups. Moreover, no significant differences in serious adverse events, somnolence/tiredness, stroke, dizziness/vertigo, and confusion were found between the groups.	Our results suggest that memantine did not have a benefit for the treatment of Lewy body disorders in cognition and motor function. However, memantine may be superior to placebo for the overall impression of the disorders. Further, memantine is well tolerated.",Lewy body disorders| Memantine| meta-analysis| systematic review,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Lately, studies have shown that these patients may probably be at an increased risk of venous thrombotic complications. Although the hemostatic changes in the chronic liver disease patients and the factors that may predict bleeding vs thrombotic complications remains an area of active research, it is believed that the coagulation cascade is delicately balanced in these patients because of parallel reduced hepatic synthesis of pro and anticoagulant factors. Thrombotic state in cirrhotic patients is responsible for not only portal or non-portal thrombosis [deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE)]; it has also been associated with progression of liver fibrosis. The use of anticoagulants in cirrhosis patients is a challenging, and often a scary situation.

874,37174709,Cells,GFAP as a Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Blood biomarkers have been considered tools for the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) and tau are primarily blood biomarkers, recent studies have identified other reliable candidates that can serve as measurable indicators of pathological conditions. One such candidate is the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocytic cytoskeletal protein that can be detected in blood samples. Increasing evidence suggests that blood GFAP levels can be used to detect early-stage AD. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to evaluate GFAP in peripheral blood as a biomarker for AD and provide an overview of the evidence regarding its utility. Our analysis revealed that the GFAP level in the blood was higher in the Aβ-positive group than in the negative groups, and in individuals with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) compared to the healthy controls. Therefore, we believe that the clinical use of blood GFAP measurements has the potential to accelerate the diagnosis and improve the prognosis of AD.",Alzheimer’s disease| GFAP| blood biomarker| cognitive impairment| glial fibrillary acidic protein,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Mind-body practice encompasses activities with the intent to use the mind to impact physical functioning and improve health.	This is a literature review using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Published International Literature on Traumatic Stress to identify the effects of mind-body intervention modalities, such as yoga, tai chi, qigong, mindfulness-based stress reduction, meditation, and deep breathing, as interventions for PTSD.	The literature search identified 92 articles, only 16 of which were suitable for inclusion in this review. We reviewed only original, full text articles that met the inclusion criteria. Most of the studies have small sample size, but findings from the 16 publications reviewed here suggest that mind-body practices are associated with positive impacts on PTSD symptoms. Mind-body practices incorporate numerous therapeutic effects on stress responses, including reductions in anxiety, depression, and anger, and increases in pain tolerance, self-esteem, energy levels, ability to relax, and ability to cope with stressful situations. In general, mind-body practices were found to be a viable intervention to improve the constellation of PTSD symptoms such as intrusive memories, avoidance, and increased emotional arousal.	Mind-body practices are increasingly used in the treatment of PTSD and are associated with positive impacts on stress-induced illnesses such as depression and PTSD in most existing studies. Knowledge about the diverse modalities of mind-body practices may provide clinicians and patients with the opportunity to explore an individualized and effective treatment plan enhanced by mind-body interventions as part of ongoing self-care.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

There is uncertainty about the prognostic value of EEG background activity after hypothermia was introduced.	Searches were made on Pubmed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to March 1, 2018. Pooled sensitivities and specificities were calculated to assess the diagnostic power of burst suppression, low voltage, and flat trace background activities in the prediction of an adverse neurological outcome in the follow-up period in hypothermia-treated neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. I[2] was used to assess heterogeneity, and meta-regression was done to explore the source of heterogeneity.	Eighteen studies with 940 neonates were included. Pooled sensitivities and specificities in predicting the combination of death and neurodevelopmental impairment were burst suppression (sensitivity 0.87 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.79 to 0.93], specificity 0.60 [95% CI 0.44 to 0.74]), low voltage (sensitivity 0.84 [0.75 to 0.90], specificity 0.80 [0.58 to 0.92]), and flat trace (sensitivity 0.85 [0.75 to 0.92], specificity 0.94 [0.77 to 0.99]). Subgroup analysis revealed the sensitivities of background patterns obtained after 24 hours of life were higher than those within age 24 hours, whereas the specificities were just the reverse. Flat trace performed best on sensitivity 0.93 (0.60 to 0.99) and specificity 0.90 (0.64 to 0.98) in predicting death. Burst suppression demonstrated the highest sensitivity 0.87 (0.58 to 0.97) and flat trace performed best on specificity 0.85 (0.60 to 0.96) in predicting neurodevelopmental impairment.

A systematic review of population-based surveys,"OBJECTIVES: To synthesise results of population surveys assessing knowledge and attitudes about prevention and treatment of dementia. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature were searched for English language entries published between 2012 and May 2017. Survey questions were grouped using an inductive approach and responses were pooled. RESULTS: Thirty-four eligible studies and four grey literature items were identified. Surveys were conducted in Europe, the US, Eastern Asia, Israel, and Australia. Nearly half of respondents agreed that dementia is a normal and non-preventable part of ageing, but belief in the potential for prevention may be improving over time. The role of cardiovascular risk factors was poorly understood overall. Less than half of respondents reported belief in the availability of a cure for dementia. The value of seeking treatment was highly endorsed. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that knowledge about the potential for dementia prevention and treatment remains poor but may be improving over time. Knowledge among those living in low- and middle-income countries are largely unknown, presenting challenges for the development of National action plans consistent with World Health Organization directives.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
878,24032437,Epilepsia,Cognitive behavior therapy for depression in people with epilepsy: a systematic review.,"Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a recommended treatment for depression in people with epilepsy (PWE); however, a recent Cochrane review found that there was insufficient evidence that any psychological therapy is effective. This conclusion provides little help to clinicians who provide interventions for depressed PWE. The aim of this review was to systematically and qualitatively review the literature on the efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and case series. We aim to determine patterns in the literature to inform the type of CBT, if any, that should be offered to PWE who are depressed. Databases MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane EBM Reviews were searched via OVID. Selection criteria included the following: (1) participants with epilepsy; (2) use of CBT; (3) valid depression outcome measure; and (4) published in peer-reviewed journal in English. Inclusions of studies were assessed by two independent researchers. We identified 14 outcome papers for 13 CBT trials including 6 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 7 case series. Positive effects of CBT on depression were reported in three of six RCTs. A review of their content revealed that all effective RCTs specifically tailored CBT to improve depression. Conversely, two of three RCTs that failed to find depression-related effects focused on improving seizure-control. This pattern was also observed in the case series. Although limited in number and having methodologic limitations, the treatment studies included in our review suggest that interventions tailored toward improving depression are possibly efficacious, whereas those that focus on improving seizure control do not appear to be. However, this review highlights that there is need for further RCTs in this area in order to confirm the possible efficacy of CBT for depression in PWE.",Mood| Psychotherapy| Seizure,Human-systematic-review,7,0

None of the studies focused on the perspective of patients with ID. The studies concerned different elements of ACP, mainly decision-making and organizational policies. No effect studies were found. Obstructing factors were difficulties in recognizing palliative needs and uncertainties among relatives and professionals about their roles and tasks in ACP.

As a result the burden of age-related conditions such as neurodegenerative diseases might be increasing. We conducted a systematic review of published studies on common neurodegenerative diseases, and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment in SSA, in order to identify research gaps and inform prevention and control solutions. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE via PubMed, 'Banque de Données de Santé Publique' and the database of the 'Institut d'Epidemiologie Neurologique et de Neurologie Tropicale' from inception to February 2013 for published original studies from SSA on neurodegenerative diseases and HIV-related neurocognitive impairment. Screening and data extraction were conducted by two investigators. Bibliographies and citations of eligible studies were investigated. RESULTS: In all 144 publications reporting on dementia (n = 49 publications, mainly Alzheimer disease), Parkinsonism (PD, n = 20), HIV-related neurocognitive impairment (n = 47), Huntington disease (HD, n = 19), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, n = 15), cerebellar degeneration (n = 4) and Lewy body dementia (n = 1). Of these studies, largely based on prevalent cases from retrospective data on urban populations, half originated from Nigeria and South Africa. The prevalence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) varied between <1% and 10.1% (0.7% and 5.6%) in population-based studies and from <1% to 47.8% in hospital-based studies. Incidence of dementia (Alzheimer disease) ranged from 8.7 to 21.8/1000/year (9.5 to 11.1), and major risk factors were advanced age and female sex. HIV-related neurocognitive impairment's prevalence (all from hospital-based studies) ranged from <1% to 80%. Population-based prevalence of PD and ALS varied from 10 to 235/100,000, and from 5 to 15/100,000 respectively while that for Huntington disease was 3.5/100,000. Equivalent figures for hospital based studies were the following: PD (0.41 to 7.2%), ALS (0.2 to 8.0/1000), and HD (0.2/100,000 to 46.0/100,000). CONCLUSIONS: The body of literature on neurodegenerative disorders in SSA is large with regard to dementia and HIV-related neurocognitive disorders but limited for other neurodegenerative disorders. Shortcomings include few population-based studies, heterogeneous diagnostic criteria and uneven representation of countries on the continent. There are important knowledge gaps that need urgent action, in order to prepare the sub-continent for the anticipated local surge in neurodegenerative diseases.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

All selected studies were assessed for risk of bias. Owing to the heterogeneity of studies in terms of study design and analysis and the use of overlapping datasets across studies, studies were analysed thematically per outcome, and the evidence was synthesised on different health outcomes without formal meta-analysis.	 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, and focused on suicide, mental health, self rated health, mortality, and other health outcomes. Of those studies, 30 (73%) were deemed to be at high risk of bias, nine (22%) at moderate risk of bias, and only two (5%) at low risk of bias, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Although there were differences across countries and groups, there was some indication that suicides increased and mental health deteriorated during the crisis. The crisis did not seem to reverse the trend of decreasing overall mortality. Evidence on self rated health and other indicators was mixed.	 Most published studies on the impact of financial crisis on health in Europe had a substantial risk of bias; therefore, results need to be cautiously interpreted. Overall, the financial crisis in Europe seemed to have had heterogeneous effects on health outcomes, with the evidence being most consistent for suicides and mental health.

All 12 studies included in this review found significant associations between sleep disturbance and cognitive dysfunction; however, results varied considerably depending on the assessment method used and the cognitive domain assessed. Self-reported sleep disturbance generally predicted self-report but not objective measures of cognitive dysfunction. Objective sleep measures (e.g., polysomnography, actigraphy) generally predicted objective impairments in processing speed and attention; however, objective sleep disturbance was more variable in predicting performance in other cognitive domains (e.g., memory, executive function).

884,19782001,The Lancet. Neurology,"Prevalence, incidence, and factors associated with pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia: a systematic review and meta-analysis","BACKGROUND: Reliable data on the prevalence and predictors of post-stroke dementia are needed to inform patients and carers, plan services and clinical trials, ascertain the overall burden of stroke, and understand its causes. However, published data on the prevalence and risk factors for pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia are conflicting. We undertook this systematic review to assess the heterogeneity in the reported rates and to identify risk factors for pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia. METHODS: Studies published between 1950 and May 1, 2009, were identified from bibliographic databases, reference lists, and journal contents pages. Studies were included if they were on patients with symptomatic stroke, were published in English, reported on a series of consecutive eligible patients or volunteers in prospective cohort studies, included all stroke or all ischaemic stroke, measured dementia by standard criteria, and followed up patients for at least 3 months after stroke. Pooled rates of dementia were stratified by study setting, inclusion or exclusion of pre-stroke dementia, and by first, any, or recurrent stroke. Pooled odds ratios were calculated for factors associated with pre-stroke and post-stroke dementia. FINDINGS: We identified 22 hospital-based and eight population-based eligible cohorts (7511 patients) described in 73 papers. The pooled prevalence of pre-stroke dementia was higher (14.4%, 95% CI 12.0-16.8) in hospital-based studies than in population-based studies (9.1%, 6.9-11.3). Although post-stroke (<or=1 year) dementia rates were heterogeneous overall, 93% of the variance was explained by study methods and case mix; the rates ranged from 7.4% (4.8-10.0) in population-based studies of first-ever stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was excluded to 41.3% (29.6-53.1) in hospital-based studies of recurrent stroke in which pre-stroke dementia was included. The cumulative incidence of dementia after the first year was little greater (3.0%, 1.3-4.7) per year in hospital-based studies than expected on the basis of recurrent stroke alone. Medial temporal lobe atrophy, female sex, and a family history of dementia were strongly associated with pre-stroke dementia, whereas the characteristics and complications of the stroke and the presence of multiple lesions in time and place were more strongly associated with post-stroke dementia. INTERPRETATION: After study methods and case mix are taken into account, reported estimates of the prevalence of dementia are consistent: 10% of patients had dementia before first stroke, 10% developed new dementia soon after first stroke, and more than a third had dementia after recurrent stroke. The strong association of post-stroke dementia with multiple strokes and the prognostic value of other stroke characteristics highlight the central causal role of stroke itself as opposed to the underlying vascular risk factors and, thus, the likely effect of optimum acute stroke care and secondary prevention in reducing the burden of dementia.

Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) included ""paroxetine"" OR ""Paxil"" exploded. The searches were not restricted by language, publication type, or study design. STUDY SELECTION: A study report was included if it described a randomized trial of paroxetine versus placebo or other antidepressants for patients with depressive disorders. Records were screened independently by 2 reviewers under the supervision of another reviewer. DATA EXTRACTION: Three investigators abstracted data, including study design, trial characteristics, and psychiatric assessment tools, using a prespecified form. Two investigators assessed quality of reporting using Jadad's scale. DATA SYNTHESIS: We included 62 unique randomized controlled trials. Paroxetine yielded consistently and significantly better remission (rate difference [RD]: 10% [95% CI = 6 to 14]), clinical response (RD: 17% [95% CI = 7 to 27]), and symptom reduction (effect size: 0.2 [95% CI = 0.1 to 0.3]) than placebo. Such consistency in the evidence base was not observed between paroxetine and other antidepressants. Pairwise comparisons of paroxetine and venlafaxine, mirtazapine, mianserin, or fluoxetine yielded inconsistent results across efficacy outcomes. Controlled-release paroxetine was the only antidepressant with significantly fewer dropouts due to adverse events than immediate-release paroxetine (RD: 5% [95% CI = 0.1 to 11]). CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant and valid differences between paroxetine and other antidepressants to suggest that multiple modes of action improve clinical outcomes.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
886,32503353,International journal of environmental research and public health,Occupational Lead Exposure and Brain Tumors: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"(1) Background: Due to inconsistencies in epidemiological findings, there has been uncertainty regarding the association of lead compounds with brain tumors. We performed a meta-analysis of published case-control and cohort studies exploring lead compound exposure and brain tumor risk. (2) Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase[®], and Cochrane to find eligible studies. Eighteen studies were selected for assessment of occupational exposure to lead compound and brain tumor. Pooled estimates of odds ratios (ORs) were obtained using random effects models. We assessed the differences through subgroup analysis according to tumor type, study design, measurements of exposure, and tumor outcome. Statistical tests for publication bias, heterogeneity, and sensitivity analysis were applied. (3) Results: Our systematic review and meta-analysis showed a not significant association with lead exposure and risk of benign and malignant brain tumors (pooled OR = 1.11, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.95-1.29). Including only malignant brain tumors, the risk of brain tumor was significantly increased (pooled OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.04-1.24). (4) Conclusions: This meta-analysis provides suggestive evidence for an association between lead compound exposure and brain tumor. In future studies, it will be necessary to identify the effect of lead compounds according to the types of brain tumor.",brain tumor| carcinogen| lead compound| meta-analysis,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Meta-analysis of cohort studies.	Studies published between January 1966 and March 2015, identified through a systematic search of Medline and Embase and review of references.	Cohort studies with a minimum of 50 participants with and 50 without atrial fibrillation that reported sex specific associations between atrial fibrillation and all cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, stroke, cardiac events (cardiac death and non-fatal myocardial infarction), and heart failure.	Two independent reviewers extracted study characteristics and maximally adjusted sex specific relative risks. Inverse variance weighted random effects meta-analysis was used to pool sex specific relative risks and their ratio.	30 studies with 4,371,714 participants were identified. Atrial fibrillation was associated with a higher risk of all cause mortality in women (ratio of relative risks for women compared with men 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.17) and a significantly stronger risk of stroke (1.99, 1.46 to 2.71), cardiovascular mortality (1.93, 1.44 to 2.60), cardiac events (1.55, 1.15 to 2.08), and heart failure (1.16, 1.07 to 1.27). Results were broadly consistent in sensitivity analyses.

The annual rate, number, and cost of PCF in the United States has increased. Far fewer studies have been published on PCF outcomes than on anterior cervical fusion (ACF) outcomes, most likely because far fewer PCFs than ACFs are performed.	To evaluate the patient-reported and clinical outcomes of adult patients who underwent subaxial posterior cervical fusion with decompression.	Systematic review and meta-analysis.

This study was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and a preapproved protocol. PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published from January 2001 through July 2018. Statistical analyses for patient-reported outcomes were performed on the outcomes' raw mean differences, calculated as postoperative value minus preoperative value from each study. Pooled rates of successful fusion, revision surgery, and complications or adverse events, and their 95% confidence intervals, were also calculated. Two subgroup analyses were performed: one for studies in which only myelopathy or radiculopathy (or both) were stated as surgical indications and the other for studies in which only myelopathy or ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (or both) were stated as surgical indications. This study was funded by Providence Medical Technology, Inc. ($32,000).	Thirty-three articles were included in the systematic review, and 31 articles were included in the meta-analysis. For all surgical indications and for the 2 subgroup analyses, every cumulative change in patient-reported outcome improved. Many of the reported changes in patient-reported outcome also exceeded the minimal clinically important differences. Pooled outcome rates with all surgical indications were 98.25% for successful fusion, 1.09% for revision, and 9.02% for complications or adverse events. Commonly reported complications or adverse events were axial pain, C5 palsy, transient neurological worsening, and wound infection.

The purpose of this article is to compare the efficacy and safety of first-line contact aspiration and stent-retriever thrombectomy in stroke patients with anterior circulation large-artery occlusion.	We undertook a systematic review of studies of patients treated for large-artery occlusion, with the latest devices of either strategy, within six hours of stroke onset. We determined rates of final complete reperfusion (defined as modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction score = 3), periprocedural complications and 90-day functional independence (defined as modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score 0-2), and excellent outcome (defined as mRS score 0-1) after contact aspiration and after stent-retriever thrombectomy using random-effects meta-analyses. Any differential effects in rates between the two strategies were assessed using random-effects meta-regressions.	Fifteen studies (1817 patients) were included. There was no difference in rates of final complete reperfusion at the end of all endovascular procedures between contact aspiration and stent retrievers (51.1%, 95% confidence interval (CI) 39.3-62.9; vs 38.3%, 95% CI 28.6-48.0; pint = 0.14), 90-day functional independence (45.0%, 40.7-49.2; vs 52.4%, 47.7-57.1; pint = 0.45) and excellent outcome (32.1%, 25.7-38.5; vs 34.1%, 21.2-46.9; pint = 0.94).

The epidemiology of dementia in persons with epilepsy, and vice versa, is not well characterized. The purpose of this systematic review was to examine the prevalence, incidence, and reported risk factors for dementia in epilepsy and epilepsy in dementia. METHODS: Embase, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, and the Cochrane databases were searched from inception. Papers were included if they reported the incidence and/or prevalence of dementia and epilepsy. Two individuals independently performed duplicate abstract and full-text review, data extraction, and quality assessment. Random-effects models were used to generate pooled estimates when feasible. RESULTS: Of the 3,043 citations identified, 64 were reviewed in full text and 19 articles were included. The period prevalence of dementia ranged from 8.1 to 17.5 per 100 persons among persons with epilepsy (insufficient data to pool). The pooled period prevalence of epilepsy among persons with dementia was 5 per 100 persons (95% confidence interval [CI] 1-9) in population-based settings and 4 per 100 persons (95% CI 1-6) in clinic settings. There were insufficient data to report a pooled overall incidence rate and only limited data on risk factors.

891,35879665,BMC geriatrics,Effect of multicomponent exercise in cognitive impairment: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND: Multicomponent physical exercise is the most recommended type of physical intervention in older adults. Experimental data suggest the relevance of the muscle-brain axis and the relationship between muscle contraction and release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, however, the impact of this relationship on cognition remains unclear, especially in people with diagnosis of cognitive impairment. This study assesses the effect of multicomponent physical exercise on global cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials published until January 2021 were searched across three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Database). Data about exercises included in the multicomponent intervention (endurance, strength, balance, or flexibility), the inclusion of aerobic exercise, and the change in global cognition were extracted. The effect size was represented as a standardized mean difference. Risk of bias was assessed by the RoB2 tool. RESULTS: A total of 8 studies were included. The overall effect size suggested an effect of multicomponent exercise on global cognition. However, the subgroup analysis showed an effect only when aerobic exercise was included in the intervention. No effect when mild cognitive impairment and dementia were assessed separately was found. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that multicomponent physical exercise could have an effect on global cognition in people with mild cognitive impairment or dementia only when aerobic exercise is included in the intervention. Our results support the inclusion of structured physical exercise programs in the management of people with cognitive impairment.",Cognitive impairment| Meta-analysis| Non-pharmacological treatment| Physical activity,Human-systematic-review,7,0

PubMed was systematically searched to identify eligible articles, and data on long-term survival were meta-analyzed in terms of hazard ratios (HR) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Level of heterogeneity among studies and publication bias were estimated. A total of 17 studies with 9991 ALS patients were included in the review. Each increase of 1 kg/m[2] in body mass index was associated with significantly better long-term overall survival (HR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.97; p < 0.001). Obesity may also be a strong predictor of favorable long-term prognosis (HR 0.73; 95%CI 0.62-0.86; p < 0.001).

A systematic literature review,"INTRODUCTION: Migraine is a common primary headache disorder, which affects mainly young females, usually those with some specific personality traits including neuroticism and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Among many factors that may trigger headache are to be found those associated with eating patterns and behaviours. Eating disorders are psychiatric disorders of abnormal eating or weight-control behaviours. According to the most up-to-date classification, six main types are identified, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and binge eating disorder. Similar to migraine, eating disorders are mainly diagnosed in young adults and, moreover, personality pattern, in at least some of the eating disorders, is also suggested to be consistent. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This systematic review aimed to summarise the available literature related to this topic. We performed an electronic article search through the Embase, PubMed, and Cochrane databases and included 16 articles into analysis in accordance with PRISMA 2020 guidelines. RESULTS: Most of the studies revealed the presence of a putative correlation between migraine and eating disorders, and these encourage further investigations. Moreover, apart from the clinical aspect, also the pathogenesis underlying both disorders is suggested to be similar. More frequent co-occurrence of other psychiatric disorders in migraineurs, such as depression and anxiety, was reported and should be considered in future research. Furthermore, adverse interactions between pharmacotherapy and symptoms of comorbid conditions underline the importance of this problem. CONCLUSIONS: A correlation between migraine and eating disorders appears highly probable. However, further investigations are required focusing on diverse aspects such as clinical, psychological, and pathogenic.",anorexia nervosa| bulimia nervosa| eating disorders| migraine| primary headache disorders,Human-systematic-review,7,0
895,34389509,Journal of the Academy of Consultation-Liaison Psychiatry,Remote Collaborative Care With Off-Site Behavioral Health Care Managers: A Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.,"In the United States, most patients who require behavioral health care do not receive it owing to an overall shortage of behavioral health specialists. The Collaborative Care Model (CoCM) is a team-based, highly-coordinated approach to treating common mental health conditions in primary care that has a robust evidence base. Several recent randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams. As telehealth technology advances and uptake expands, understanding the evidence for remote CoCM becomes increasingly crucial to inform CoCM practice and implementation.	The objective of this study was to systematically review randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of remote CoCM teams in treating common psychiatric conditions in primary care and medical settings.	Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis guidelines were used to structure our review. Our search strategy and development of search terms was informed by knowledge and review of the CoCM literature. Articles were reviewed by 3 authors, and once selected, they were sent to 2 authors for further data extraction to describe various study characteristics and process measures relating to remote CoCM.	The literature search identified 13,211 articles, 9 of which met inclusion criteria. The 9 studies collectively demonstrate effectiveness of remote CoCM in treating a range of behavioral health conditions (depression [n = 7], anxiety [n = 2], and PTSD [n = 1]), across various populations and settings. Sample sizes ranged from 191 patients to 704 patients, publication dates from 2004 to 2018, and studies were conducted from 2000 to 2014. Various process measures were also reported.	As the 9 studies included in our systematic review demonstrate, remote CoCM can be effective in treating a range of behavioral health conditions in various primary care and specialty medical settings. These findings suggest organizations may have more flexibility in building their CoCM team and drawing upon wider workforces than previously recognized. As recent shifts in telehealth policy and practice continue to motivate telehealth approaches, further research that can inform best practices for remote CoCM will be useful and valuable to those making organizational decisions when implementing integrated care models.",behavioral health care manager| collaborative care| integrated care| psychiatric consultant| remote| telehealth,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Nine electronic databases (including PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched from their inception through June 2016. Seventeen studies were included in this meta-analysis. Data on 1479 eligible patients were extracted, and the relative risk (RR) and standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI for the effective rate (ER), swallowing function assessment (SFA), individual activity (IA), eg., modified Barthel Index (MBI) and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated.	The pooled ER (RR 1.26, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.34, P<0.001, 14 studies) and SFA (SMD 1.06, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.32, P<0.001, five studies) suggested that combination therapy yielded a significantly higher ER and improved the SFA scores to a greater degree than swallowing training alone in patients with poststroke dysphagia. The pooled QOL score (SMD 1.06; 95% CI -0.04 to 2.17, P=0.06, two studies) did not differ between groups. The MBI data (SMD 1.47, 95% CI 1.07 to 1.87, P<0.001, one study) showed significant improvement in IA. Some evidence of publication bias was observed for the ER, although the trim-and-fill analysis and fail-safe number indicated no influence of publication bias on its pooled effect size. There was no evidence of publication bias of any other outcome measures.	This study showed that acupuncture combined with swallowing training may improve the ER, swallowing function and activities of daily life of patients with poststroke dysphagia compared with conventional swallowing training alone.",acupuncture| effective rate| individual activity| post-stroke dysphagia| quality of life| swallowing function assessment| swallowing training,Human-systematic-review,7,0

American volume,Thromboprophylaxis in patients with acute spinal injuries: an evidence-based analysis.,"The increased risk for venous thromboembolic events following spinal trauma is well established. The purpose of the present study was to examine the literature in order to determine the optimum thromboprophylaxis regimen for patients with acute spinal injuries with or without spinal cord injury.	EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases were searched from the earliest available date to April 2008 for clinical trials comparing different methods of thromboprophylaxis in adult patients following acute spinal injuries (with or without spinal cord injury). Outcome measures included the prevalences of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and treatment-related adverse events.	The search yielded 489 studies, but only twenty-one of them fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis was significantly lower in patients without spinal cord injury as compared with patients with spinal cord injury (odds ratio = 6.0; 95% confidence interval = 2.9 to 12.7). Patients with an acute spinal cord injury who were receiving oral anticoagulants had significantly fewer episodes of pulmonary embolism (odds ratio = 0.1; 95% confidence interval = 0.01 to 0.63) than those who were not receiving oral anticoagulants (either untreated controls or patients managed with low-molecular-weight heparin). The start of thromboprophylaxis within the first two weeks after the injury resulted in significantly fewer deep-vein-thrombosis events than delayed initiation did (odds ratio = 0.2; 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 0.4). With regard to heparin-based pharmacoprophylaxis in patients with spinal trauma, low-molecular-weight heparin significantly reduced the rates of deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding episodes in comparison with the findings in patients who received unfractionated heparin, with odds ratios of 2.6 (95% confidence interval = 1.2 to 5.6) and 7.5 (95% confidence interval = 1.0 to 58.4) for deep-vein thrombosis and bleeding, respectively.	The prevalence of deep-vein thrombosis following a spine injury is higher among patients who have a spinal cord injury than among those who do not have a spinal cord injury. Therefore, thromboprophylaxis in these patients should start as early as possible once it is deemed safe in terms of potential bleeding complications. Within this population, low-molecular-weight heparin is more effective for the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis, with fewer bleeding complications, than unfractionated heparin is. The use of vitamin K antagonists appeared to be effective for the prevention of pulmonary embolism.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
898,30094499,Neurosurgical review,"Depression and glioblastoma, complicated concomitant diseases: a systemic review of published literature.","Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary brain cancer. Depression is a common co-morbidity of this condition. Despite this common interaction, relatively little research has been performed on the development of GBM-associated depression. We performed a literary search of the PubMed database for articles published relating to GBM and depression. A total of 85 articles were identified with 46 meeting inclusion criteria. Depression significantly impacts care, decreasing medication compliance, and patient survival. Diagnostically, because depression and GBM share intricate neuro-connectivity in a way that effect functionality, these diseases can be mistaken for alternative psychological or pathological disorders, complicating care. Therapeutically, anti-depressants have anti-tumor properties; yet, some have been shown to interfere with GBM treatment. One reason for this is that the pathophysiological development of depression and GBM share several pathways including altered regulation of the 5-HT receptor, norepinephrine, and 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate. Over time, depression can persist after GBM treatment, affecting patient quality of life. Together, depression and GBM are complicated concomitant diseases. Clinicians must be aware of their co-existence. Because of overlapping molecular pathways involved in both diseases, careful medication selection is imperative to avoid potential adverse interactions. Since GBMs are the most common primary brain cancer, physicians dealing with this disease should be prepared for the development of depression as a potential sequela of this condition, given the related pathophysiology and the known poor outcomes.",Anti-depressants| Depression| Glioblastoma| Major depressive disorder| Patient outcomes,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Many adolescents use the internet to seek health care information. However, young people face barriers before they can understand and apply the health information that they access on the web. It is essential that usability of adolescent health websites on the internet is improved to help adolescents overcome these barriers and allow them to engage successfully with web-based health care content.	The aim of this review was to synthesize the usability of specific health information websites. These findings were mapped onto the adolescent neurodevelopmental profile, and a design brief based on the findings was developed to tailor future websites for specific adolescent requirements.	A systematic search conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO, and Education Resources Information Center (ERIC) identified 25 studies that assessed the usability of health information websites. Adolescent feedback was collected by a mixture of surveys, focus groups, interviews, and think-aloud procedures.	A majority of the information websites were developed for specific health issues that may be relevant to adolescents. The most preferred website features were interactive content such as games and quizzes, as well as videos, images, audio clips, and animations. Participants also preferred communicating with other adolescents with similar conditions or learning about their experience through real stories and testimonials. Adolescents found it difficult to use health information websites if they contained too much text, were too cluttered, or had features that made it difficult to access. The findings are considered in the context of adolescent social processes, low tolerance of delayed gratification, and attraction to novelty and mapped onto a neurodevelopmental model of adolescence.	Young people's feedback can determine usability and content that make a health information website easy or informative to use.

Despite routine use of intraoperative facial nerve (FN) monitoring, FN injury still is a complication of major concern due to severe negative impact on patient's quality of life. METHODS: Through searches of PubMed, we provided a systematic review of the current literature up to February, 2011, emphasizing all respects of FN monitoring for cerebellopontine angle and skull base tumor surgery from description to current success on function prediction of standard and emerging monitoring techniques. RESULTS: Currently, standard monitoring techniques comprise direct electrical stimulation (DES), free-running electromyography (EMG), and facial motor evoked potential (FMEP). We included 62 studies on function prediction by investigating DES (43 studies), free-running EMG (13 studies), and FMEP (6 studies) criteria. DES mostly evaluated postoperative function by using absolute amplitude, stimulation threshold, and proximal-to-distal amplitude ratio, whereas free-running EMG used the train-time criterion. The prognostic significance of FMEP was assessed with the final-to-baseline amplitude ratio, as well as the event-to-baseline amplitude ratio and waveform complexity. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a general agreement on the satisfactory functional prediction of different electrophysiological criteria, the lack of standardization in electrode montage and stimulation parameters precludes a definite conclusion regarding the best method. Moreover, studies emphasizing comparison between criteria or even multimodal monitoring and its impact on FN anatomical and functional preservation are still lacking in the literature.",CMAP| CN| CPA| Cerebellopontine angle| Cerebellopontine angle surgery| Compound muscle action potentials| Cranial nerves| DES| Direct electrical stimulation| EMG| Electromyography| FMEP| FN| Facial motor evoked potential| Facial nerve| IAC| IOFNM| Internal auditory canal| Intraoperative facial nerve monitoring| Intraoperative monitoring| MEP| Motor evoked potential| REZ| Root exit zone| SEP| Skull base surgery| Somatosensory evoked potential| TES| Transcranial electrocortical stimulation| VS| Vestibular schwannoma,Human-systematic-review,7,0

902,35653914,NeuroImage. Clinical,Understanding brain function in vascular cognitive impairment and dementia with EEG and MEG: A systematic review,"Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI) is the second most prevalent dementia after Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and cerebrovascular disease (CBVD) is a major comorbid contributor to the progression of most neurodegenerative diseases. Early differentiation of cognitive impairment is critical given both the high prevalence of CBVD, and that its risk factors are modifiable. The ability for electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetoencephalogram (MEG) to detect changes in brain functioning for other dementias suggests that they may also be promising biomarkers for early VCI. The present systematic review aims to summarize the literature regarding electrophysiological patterns of mild and major VCI. Despite considerable heterogeneity in clinical definition and electrophysiological methodology, common patterns exist when comparing patients with VCI to healthy controls (HC) and patients with AD, though there is a low specificity when comparing between VCI subgroups. Similar to other dementias, slowed frequency patterns and disrupted inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity are repeatedly reported for VCI patients, as well as longer latencies and smaller amplitudes in evoked responses. Further study is needed to fully establish MEG and EEG as clinically useful biomarkers, including a clear definition of VCI and standardized methodology, allowing for comparison across groups and consolidation of multicenter efforts.",Electroencephalogram| Magnetoencephalogram| Neurophysiology| Vascular Cognitive Impairment (VCI)| Vascular Dementia (VaD),Human-systematic-review,7,0

SLT users had 1.34 times or 13.4% higher risk of fatal stroke, though risk of nonfatal stroke was not enhanced. Significantly higher risk of stroke was seen in users of chewing tobacco (1.35, 95% CI 1.20–1.50) in comparison to non-chewers. Gender-based analysis showed enhanced risk of fatal stroke in both male and female users. SLT-attributable fraction of fatal stroke was highest for India at 14.8%.	The significant higher risk of stroke with SLT use, even after adjustment for smoking, emphasizes the imperative need to include SLT cessation advice for control and prevention of stroke.",attributable fraction| cerebrovascular| meta-analysis| smokeless tobacco| stroke,Human-systematic-review,7,0

The purpose of this scoping review was to understand the type and amount of physical activity interventions performed in this population as well as their effect.	PubMed, Cochran and CINAHL Complete were systematically searched for articles describing physical activity interventions in people with a chronic, stable central nervous system lesion. The outcome measures needed to include physiological or psychological variables, measures of general health or quality of life.	Of the initial 7554 articles, 34 were included after the title, abstract, and full-text screening. Only six studies were designed as randomized-controlled trials. Most interventions were supported by technologies, mainly functional electrical stimulation (cycling or rowing). The duration of the intervention ranged from four to 52 weeks. Endurance and strength training interventions (and a combination of both) were performed and over 70% of studies resulted in health improvements.	Non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments may benefit from physical activity interventions. However, the number of studies and their comparability is very limited. This indicates the need for future research with standard measures to develop evidence-based, specific recommendations for physical activity in this population.Key messagesPhysical activity interventions can have health benefits in non-ambulatory people with severe motor impairments.Even simple, low-tech interventions allow for health-enhancing training.",Physical activity| nervous system lesion| physiology| psychology| scoping review| severe motor impairment,Human-systematic-review,7,0

A systematic search of databases PubMed, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and PsycINFO through April 2011 was performed.	Two independent raters identified and examined studies that reported laboratory- or field-based measures of maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity in children with CP aged 5 to 14 years.	The COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health status Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) checklist was used by 2 independent raters to evaluate the methodologic quality of the included clinimetric studies and to identify measures used in these studies.	Twenty-four studies that used a maximal aerobic or anaerobic capacity measure were identified. Five studies reported clinimetric properties for 5 measures (2 aerobic and 3 anaerobic measures). Methodologic quality was excellent in 3 studies, showing good validity and reliability of field-based aerobic (Shuttle Run Test) and anaerobic (Muscle Power Sprint Test) measures. The studies on laboratory-based measures were rated fair, mainly because of inadequate statistics. The level of evidence was strong for good validity and reliability of the field-based tests. The level of evidence was unknown for validity and low to moderate for good reliability of laboratory-based tests.	There is a paucity of research on the clinimetric properties of measurement instruments to assess aerobic and anaerobic capacity for children with CP. Further clinimetric studies of laboratory-based measures in children with CP at all Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels, and clinimetric studies of field-based measures in children who are classified as GMFCS levels III to V are required.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0
906,16236167,Health and quality of life outcomes,"Differential effect sizes of growth hormone replacement on Quality of Life, well-being and health status in growth hormone deficient patients: a meta-analysis.","Patients with growth hormone deficiency (GHD) frequently report to suffer from an impaired Quality of Life (QoL) and growth hormone (GH) substitution is found to improve this. However, the same test may be used for measuring QoL, well-being or health status in different studies. QoL has been defined as the subjective appraisal of one's current life based primarily on psychological function. The most important in the appraisal of well-being is mental function and concerning health status patients evaluate physical function as most important. To differentiate the effects of GH replacement on psychological variables in patients with GHD we carried out a number of meta-analyses, classifying questionnaires into instruments measuring QoL, psychological well-being and health status.	We searched the electronic databases PUBMED and PiCarta from 1985 to 2004. Studies were included that evaluated the effect of GH on patient-reported outcomes in adults with GHD (aged 18 years and above). According to generally accepted definitions we classified the questionnaires as instruments measuring QoL, well-being and health status. By means of meta-analyses the average effect size (d) for QoL, well-being and health status was calculated.	Based on open studies GH replacement is found to improve QoL with a small effect size (d = 0.18), well-being with a medium effect size (d = 0.47) and health status with a small effect size (d = 0.26). As the effect size of well-being is most pronounced the generally reported effects of GH replacement on QoL may be overestimated and actually reflect the effect on well-being.	To get more insight in the specific psychological effects of GH treatment it is recommended that instruments selected for these studies should be more consistently classified as instruments measuring QoL, well-being or health status.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Dementia is most prevalent of all. In general scenario, a dementia patient lacks proper guidance in searching out the way to return back at his/her home. Thus, increasing the risk of getting damaged at individual-health level. Therefore, it is important to track their movement in more sophisticated manner as possible. With emergence of wearables, GPS sensors and Internet of Things (IoT), such devices have become available in public domain. Smartphone apps support caregiver to locate the dementia patients in real-time. RF, GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi and 4G technology fill the communication gap between patient and caregiver to bring them closer. In this paper, we incorporated 7 most popular wearables for investigation to seek appropriateness for dementia tracking in recent times in systematic manners. We performed an in-depth review of these wearables as per the cost, technology wise and application wise characteristics. A case novel study i.e. IoT-based Force Sensor Resistance enabled System-FSRIoT, has been proposed and implemented to validate the effectiveness of IoT in the domain of smarter dementia patient tracking in wearable form factor. The results show promising aspect of a whole new notion to leverage efficient assistive physio-medical healthcare to the dementia patients and the affected family members to reduce life risks and achieve a better social life.",Dementia| IoT| Sensor system| Tracking| Wearables,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of animal assisted therapy (AAT) with special focus on canis therapy among people with dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: The key method of this review study is a systematic review of the research studies detected in the Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed. The search was conducted for the studies dating from 2016 till 31 August 2018 because several review studies were published before. Eventually, only six studies were involved into the final analysis. RESULTS: The findings of this review, based on significant effect sizes, reveal that AAT may work as a beneficial and effective complementary treatment, especially in the area of behavioral and psychological symptoms, for patients with different degree of dementia severity if AAT is targeted at their specific needs and interests. CONCLUSIONS: More research in the area of methodology for the implementation of AAT is necessary, and more research should be conducted with respect to the use of AAT for the improvement of cognitive functions in people with dementia.",Dementia| Dogs| Effectiveness| Intervention| Review| Therapy,Human-systematic-review,7,0

This systematic review synthesized the evidence for an association between epigenetic aging and dementia, mild cognitive impairment and cognitive function. Methods: A systematic search was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: 30 eligible articles were included. There was no strong evidence that accelerated epigenetic aging was associated with dementia/mild cognitive impairment (n = 7). There was some evidence of an association with poorer cognition (n = 20), particularly with GrimAge acceleration, but this was inconsistent and varied across cognitive domains.

911,15495104,The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,Betamimetics for inhibiting preterm labour,"BACKGROUND: Preterm birth is a major contributor to perinatal mortality and morbidity worldwide. Tocolytic agents are drugs used to inhibit uterine contractions. The most widely used tocolytic agents are betamimetics especially in resource-poor countries. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of betamimetics given to women with preterm labour. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group trials register (May 2003) without language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of betamimetics, administered by any route or any dose, in the treatment of women in preterm labour where betamimetics are compared with other betamimetics, placebo or no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers evaluated independently methodological quality and extracted the data. We sought additional information to enable assessment of methodology and conduct intention-to-treat analyses. We present the results using the relative risk for categorical data and the weighted mean difference for continuous data. MAIN RESULTS: Eleven randomised controlled trials, involving 1332 women, compared betamimetics with placebo. Betamimetics decreased the number of women in preterm labour giving birth within 48 hours (relative risk (RR) 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53 to 0.75) but there was no decrease in the number of births within seven days after carrying out a sensitivity analysis of studies with adequate allocation of concealment. No benefit was demonstrated for betamimetics on perinatal death (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.46 to 1.55, 7 trials, n = 1332), or neonatal death (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.48 to 2.09, 5 trials, n = 1174). No significant effect was demonstrated for respiratory distress syndrome (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.71 to 1.08, 8 trials, n = 1239). A few trials reported the following outcomes, with no difference detected: cerebral palsy, infant death and necrotizing enterocolitis. Betamimetics were significantly associated with the following: withdrawal from treatment due to adverse effects; chest pain; dyspnoea; tachycardia; palpitation; tremor; headaches; hypokalemia; hyperglycemia; nausea/vomiting; and nasal stuffiness; and fetal tachycardia. Other betamimetics were compared with ritodrine in five trials (n = 948). Trials were small, varied and of insufficient quality to delineate any consistent patterns of effect. REVIEWERS' CONCLUSIONS: Betamimetics help to delay delivery for women transferred to tertiary care or completed a course of antenatal corticosteroids. However, multiple adverse effects must be considered. The data are too few to support the use of any particular betamimetics.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

We aimed to assess the evidence from randomised controlled trials of their effects.	To review the randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials of Dan Shen agents for acute ischaemic stroke. The primary objective was to determine whether Dan Shen agents improve functional outcome without causing undue harm in patients with acute ischaemic stroke. Secondary objectives were to assess the effect of Dan Shen agents on impairment and on quality of life.	We searched the Cochrane Stroke Group Trials Register (last searched September 2003), the register of the Cochrane Complementary Field (last searched September 2003) and the Chinese Stroke Trials Register (last searched September 2003). In addition we searched the following bibliographic databases: The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (The Cochrane Library, Issue 4, 2002), MEDLINE (1996 to December 2002), EMBASE (1980 to December 2002), CINAHL (1982 to December 2002), AMED (1985 to December 2002) and China Biological Medicine Database (CBM-disc 1979 to December 2002). We handsearched 10 Chinese journals, searched clinical trials and research databases, scanned reference lists and contacted the pharmaceutical company manufacturing Dan Shen.

Two reviewers independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted the data.	Eight potentially eligible trials were identified, of which three trials (304 patients) were included. Two trials were excluded and three trials are awaiting assessment. Numbers of deaths and dependent patients at the end of follow-up of at least three months were not reported in the three included trials. Only one trial reported adverse events. Three trials measured the outcome 'significant improvement in neurological deficit at the end of treatment'. Compound Dan Shen agents were associated with a significant increase in the number of patients with the outcome (Peto Odds Ratio (OR) 2.72, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 1.10 to 6.72). No deaths were reported within the first two weeks of treatment or during the whole follow-up period (21 to 28 days). The trials did not include any assessment of quality of life.

Several sleep interventions have been tested in established AD dementia cases. However early intervention is needed in the course of AD at Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stages to help prevent decline and maintain good quality of life. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on sleep interventions in MCI and mild AD dementia. Seven databases were systematically searched for interventional studies where ≥ 75% of participants met diagnostic criteria for MCI/mild AD dementia, with a control group and validated sleep outcome measures. Studies with a majority of participants diagnosed with Moderate to Severe AD were excluded. After removal of duplicates, 22,133 references were returned in two separate searches (August 2019 and September 2020). 325 full papers were reviewed with 18 retained. Included papers reported 16 separate studies, total sample (n = 1,056), mean age 73.5 years. 13 interventions were represented: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - Insomnia (CBT-I), A Multi-Component Group Based Therapy, A Structured Limbs Exercise Programme, Aromatherapy, Phase Locked Loop Acoustic Stimulation, Transcranial Stimulation, Suvorexant, Melatonin, Donepezil, Galantamine, Rivastigmine, Tetrahydroaminoacridine and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Psychotherapeutic approaches utilising adapted CBT-I and a Structured Limbs Exercise Programme each achieved statistically significant improvements in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index with one study reporting co-existent improved actigraphy variables. Suvorexant significantly increased Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency whilst reducing Wake After Sleep Onset time. Transcranial Stimulation enhanced cortical slow oscillations and spindle power during daytime naps. Melatonin significantly reduced sleep latency in two small studies and sleep to wakefulness transitions in a small sample. CPAP demonstrated efficacy in participants with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. Evidence to support other interventions was limited. Whilst new evidence is emerging, there remains a paucity of evidence for sleep interventions in MCI and mild AD highlighting a pressing need for high quality experimental studies exploring alternative sleep interventions.",AD| Alzheimer's dementia| Alzheimer's disease| MCI| mild cognitive impairment| sleep,Human-systematic-review,7,0

AIM: To identify and synthesize psychiatric outcomes in patients with TLE and comorbid psychiatric illnesses before and after TLE surgery. METHODS: Studies were included if participants were adults and/or children with temporal epilepsy and comorbid psychiatric illness. Surgical interventions included focal resection (e.g., lobectomy, selective amygdalohippocampectomy) or stereotactic laser ablation. Included studies reported on pre- and post- surgery data of comorbid psychiatric illness (e.g., mood and anxiety disorders, depression, psychosis, adjustment disorders, non-epileptic seizures, and personality disorders). RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the review. The proportion of patients achieving PD resolution or improvements after surgery varied widely between studies, ranging from 15 % to 57 % at the reported follow-up time. Three studies reported on PD symptom worsening after surgery, with considerable variations of patient proportions across studies. Meta-analysis suggests that 43 % of patients demonstrated improvement and 33 % of patients showed a worsening in psychiatric scores across all studies. Preliminary data from three studies suggest that seizure control may be associated with favourable psychiatric outcomes. CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of reported TLE patients with comorbid psychiatric illnesses have improvement in their psychiatric symptoms after temporal lobe epilepsy surgery. There is scarcity of detailed outcome reporting including symptom scores, and to date, predictive factors for favourable vs unfavourable outcomes in this patient population are not clear. Further research on the topic is warranted.","Temporal lobe epilepsy, systematic review, psychiatric disorders| Temporal lobe surgery",Human-systematic-review,7,0

One potential tobacco use correlate is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) phenomena. The growing research evidence on the association between tobacco use and OCD phenomena is mixed, making it difficult to synthesize extant findings into meaningful conclusions. Indeed, there has never been a systematic review or meta-analysis of this area of research. To this end, a systematic review was carried out with studies between 1988 and 2021, and from this review, 71 independent estimations (n = 10,475; Females = 51.95%; mean age = 37.29, SD = 13.78) were extracted for meta-analysis. We found that about three in ten participants with OCD are likely to use tobacco, which is higher than the general population. The prevalence was the same among OCD participants at all levels (those with symptomology but no confirmed diagnosis, those surpassing a clinical cutoff for OCD but no confirmed diagnosis, and those with a confirmed OCD diagnosis). The results also indicated considerable variability across study results and a wide confidence interval associated with the tobacco use prevalence rate among those with OCD phenomena. The findings provide support for continued study of this comorbidity, perhaps with longitudinal and experimental designs to test for reciprocal associations between tobacco use and OCD phenomena in the service of targeting nicotine dependence as a substantial global public health concern.",OCD| Smoking| meta-analysis| nicotine| obsessive-compulsive disorder| prevalence| tobacco,Human-systematic-review,7,0
916,26881859,Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,Pharmacotherapy of Aggression in Child and Adolescent Psychiatric Disorders.,"Aggression is a common, yet complex, behavioral complaint, and a frequent indication for referral to child and adolescent psychiatrist treatment. This article reviews the evidence supporting pharmacotherapy of aggression in youth, with a primary focus on impulsive aggression (the primary indication for this intervention). Relevant diagnostic considerations and consensus guidelines are discussed.	Articles examining the role of medications in the treatment of aggression in youth with pathological aggression were identified using PubMed and MEDLINE® databases over the past 15 years (2000-2015); selected articles published prior to 2000 and deemed to be of high relevance were searched and also included. Search terms included: Aggression, aggressive, disruptive behavior, conduct, youth, children, and adolescents. Cited references were also searched for relevant articles.	There are a number of evidence-based medication treatments for aggression, which are generally best considered in the context of differential diagnosis and ongoing evidence-based psychosocial interventions. Impulsive aggression is generally considered the type of aggression most amenable to medication, but other aggression subtypes may also possibly respond to treatment. Medication classes with positive evidence include the psychostimulants and α-2 agonists (in the presence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder [ADHD] and/or disruptive behavior disorders), mood stabilizing agents, and atypical antipsychotics. Published guidelines recommend systematic and adequate trials of medications in sequential order, to optimize response and minimize polypharmacy. Guidelines for safety monitoring are available for many of the medications used for aggression in youth, and are also discussed.	Aggression in children carries a high risk of poor outcomes, and, therefore, a better understanding of treatment options is a high priority. The available literature points to the importance of identifying the underlying disorder, when possible, and using this information to guide treatment selection. Future studies are needed to better inform the treatment of aggression across disorders, and the treatment of different aggression subtypes.",,Human-systematic-review,7,0

Most previous studies have tested bottom-up cognitive training programs but have not shown very good results. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test ease of implementation, differential safety and preliminary efficacy of two top-down (strategy-learning) home-based, individualized, cognitive interventions: Goal Management Training (GMT), adapted for PD-MCI (Adapted-GMT), and a psychoeducation program combined with mindfulness exercises (PSYCH-Mind). METHODS: This was a single-blind block-randomized between-group comparative study. Twelve PD-MCI with mild executive dysfunctions were divided in four blocks and randomly assigned to any of the two interventions. The participants were included if they had PD-MCI diagnosis (no dementia), with stabilized medication. Both groups (Adapted-GMT and PSYCH-mind) received five intervention sessions each lasting 60-90 minutes for five weeks. Measures were collected at baseline, mid-point, one-week, four-week and 12-week follow-ups. Executive functions were assessed with the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) and the Zoo Map Test (ZMT). Quality of life (QoL) and psychiatric symptoms were also evaluated. Repeated measures ANCOVAs (mixed linear analysis) were applied to all outcomes. RESULTS: There was one drop out, and both interventions were feasible and acceptable. Despite the small sample size limiting statistical power, patients of both groups significantly improved executive functions per the DEX-patient (Time: F(4,36) = 2.96, p = 0.033, CI95%: 10.75-15.23) and DEX-caregiver scores (Time: F(4,36) = 6.02, p = 0.017, CI95%: 9.63-17.23). Both groups significantly made fewer errors between measurement times on the ZMT (Time: F(3,36) = 16.66, p = 0.001, CI95%: 1.07-2.93). However, QoL significantly increased only in PSYCH-Mind patients at four-week follow-up (interaction Time*Group: F(4,36) = 5.31, p = 0.002, CI95%: 15.33-25.61). CONCLUSION: Both interventions were easily implemented and proved to be safe. Because both interventions are arguably cost-effective, these pilot findings, although promising, need to be replicated in large samples.

Thus, we developed and examined the initial feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effects of an mHealth transitions of care intervention (Mobile After-Care Support; MACS) in an open trial. Ten adults with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were recruited during their index psychiatric hospitalization and enrolled prior to discharge. Measures of feasibility, acceptability, and MACS targets were administered at baseline and a 1-month follow-up. Drawing on skills from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp), MACS delivered brief assessments of clinically relevant variables, followed by just-in-time interventions for patients starting immediately post-discharge. Individuals completed about one session per day on average as expected. Overall, measures of MACS usability and satisfaction were positive. T-test analyses showed that dysfunctional coping strategies significantly decreased from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Results also revealed statistically significant reductions in psychiatric symptoms over 1-month follow-up. This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of MACS, a new app-based intervention targeting transitions of care for patients with psychosis. The field is turning to the use of mobile technology as a means of augmenting service delivery and providing real-time assessment and intervention for patients at risk. MACS is a promising adjunctive intervention that warrants further testing in a randomized controlled trial.",Cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis| Mobile technology| Psychiatric hospitalization| Psychosis| Schizophrenia| Treatment adherence,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Medical inclusion criteria: patients (M/F) ≥ 18 years ≤ 75 with symptomatic seizures due to primary brain tumors or brain metastases in stable treatment with antiepileptic drugs; previous surgical resection or biopsy; >70 Karnofsky Performance Status; stable oncological disease. Eligible patients recruited from 100 consecutive patients with BTRE at first visit to our Center from 2011 to 2012. All recruited patients were administered battery of neuropsychological tests exploring various cognitive domains. Patients considered to have a neuropsychological deficit were those with at least one test score for a given domain indicative of impairment. Thirty patients out of 100 showed cognitive deficits, and were offered participation in RehabTr, of which 16 accepted (5 low grade glioma, 4 high grade glioma, 2 glioblastoma, 2 meningioma and 3 metastases) and 14 declined for various reasons. The RehabTr consisted of one weekly individual session of 1 h, for a total of 10 weeks, carried out by a trained psychologist. The functions trained were: memory, attention, visuo-spatial functions, language and reasoning by means of Training NeuroPsicologico (TNP(®)) software. To evaluate the effect of the RehabTr, the same battery of tests was administered directly after cognitive rehabilitation (T1), and at six-month follow-up (T2). Statistical analysis with Student T test for paired data showed that short-term verbal memory, episodic memory, fluency and long term visuo-spatial memory improved immediately after the T1 and remained stable at T2. At final follow-up all patients showed an improvement in at least one domain that had been lower than normal at baseline. Our results demonstrated a positive effect of rehabilitative training at different times, and, for these reasons, should encourage future research in this area with large, randomized clinical trials that evaluate the impact of a cognitive rehabilitation in patients with BTRE and cognitive deficits.",Antiepileptic drugs| Brain tumor| Brain tumor-related epilepsy| Cognitive deficits| Cognitive rehabilitation,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Follow-up angiograms, available in 34 patients, confirmed complete obliteration in 16 patients. Serial MRIs indicated obliteration of the nidus in one of five patients without angiography. The diffuse nidus structure and low marginal dose were significantly associated with incomplete obliteration. Twelve patients underwent a second GKS, and subsequent angiographies, available in six patients, demonstrated complete obliteration in two of them. Complications included new-onset seizures (n = 1), apraxia (n = 1), and temporal horn entrapment requiring a shunt operation (n = 1). School performance declined in 14 out of 32 patients. Both the AVM volume and modified AVM score were found to be reliable predictors of school performance.	The results of the present study substantiate the diffuse and other atypical features of pediatric AVMs as major determinants of treatment failure following GKS. Considering the apparent declination of school performance, future prospective studies would be required to investigate the possible late-effects of GKS on neuropsychological function.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
923,11738662,Surgical neurology,Surgical management of medullary hemangioblastoma. Report of 47 cases.,"Hemangioblastomas of the medulla are rare and seldom reported. Surgical resection of medullary hemangioblastomas is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. We present a unique institutional experience over a 12-year period.	Between 1987 to 1998, 47 hemangioblastomas were surgically resected and analyzed retrospectively. The follow-up ranged from 6 to 136 months with an average of 35 months.	Thirty-nine single hemangioblastomas were distributed in 3 anatomical areas: pontomedullary, medullary, and cervico-medullary. They were either focal intramedullary or dorsal exophytic. There were cyst formations in 97.4% of the single hemangioblastomas. The major feeding arteries and the tumor blush could be clearly visualized on angiogram, sometimes even on MRA. All medullary hemangioblastomas were radically removed. Postoperatively, 61.5% patients had clinical improvement, two patients' symptoms remained unchanged and 11 patients deteriorated; of the latter, 8 patients improved later with proper therapy, and 2 patients died.	Preoperative diagnosis of medullary hemangioblastoma is possible with MRI. With improved microsurgical technique and better understanding of the vascular pattern of the tumor, total surgical resection can be performed with <5% mortality. The surgical strategy is en bloc excision, as piecemeal resection can lead to uncontrollable hemorrhage. Removal of large solid hemangioblastomas may result in severe postoperative edema and/or hemorrhage in the medulla affecting the respiratory and vagal centers. Preoperative embolization through the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) can be helpful in this situation.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Informed consent procedures were followed and agreed upon by participants and their families. The participants ranged in age from 73-90 years, with an average age of 81 years. An experienced board-certified music therapist led 16 singalong sessions. The sessions were divided into 4 sessions of each of the following 4 conditions in randomized order of presentation: (a) live music of simple guitar accompaniment, (b) live music of complex guitar accompaniment, (c) recorded music of simple guitar accompaniment, and (d) recorded music of complex guitar accompaniment. Results indicated no significant differences in the amount of singing by the group for the 4 conditions. However, there were significant differences in group behavior related to the 4 conditions before and after song presentations, including attention, leaving the group, reading lyrics, compliments, and applause.

925,18982754,Collegium antropologicum,Influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders.,"This aimed to measure the influence of the Monitored Youth Mentoring Program (MYMP) for adolescents with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The MYMP commenced in 1997 and was completed in 2003. The model of the program was for one university student of Pedagogy to mentor one pupil between the ages of 13 and 17 years, demonstrating risk seeking behaviours for a whole school year. The specimen group was made up of 141 pupils, approximately 20 pupils from each year level. The short-term goal was to influence positive change in participants demonstrating risk seeking behaviour. The long-term goal was to enhance the respective school's programs to enable preventative approaches to lessen negative and risk seeking behaviours amongst pupils with behavioural problems and behavioural disorders. The research results demonstrate statistically significant success of the applied program in two measured variables. Firstly, learning success (p < 0.05), and secondly a decrease in truancy and disciplinary misdemeanours (p < 0.05). Both of which were observed in participants with behavioural problems. The program was not as successful for participants with behavioural disorders, but not without some effect. Although the program can be generally described as achieving a medium level of success, the fact that there was a lack of progressive worsening in participant's behaviour is a substantial bi-product of the program. The mentors involved in the program made it extremely clear by their feedback that, MYMP positively enhanced their formal Pedagogy training, through hands-on practise that they otherwise would not have received through their academic programs. They were provided with vital exposure to a preventative program and managed to gain insight into the possibilities of introducing early intervention and prevention into Croatian schools.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Several types of stem cells have been investigated to ensure the safety and efficacy in clinical trials.Cryopreserved umbilical cord blood (UCB) mononuclear cells (MNCs) obtained from healthy donors have a more stabilized quality, thereby ensuring a successful therapy. A phase I study was conducted on patients aged 45-80 years who sustained acute ischemic stroke. An UCB unit was obtained from a public cord blood bank based on ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score (6/6), and cell dose (total MNC count of 0.5-5 × 10[7] cells/kg). In addition, to facilitate blood brain barrier penetration of UCB, 4 doses of 100 mL mannitol was administered intravenously after 30 min after UCB transplantation and every 4 h thereafter. The primary outcomes were the number of disease (GVHD) within 100 days after transfusion. The secondary outcomes were changes in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Barthel index, and Berg Balance Scale scores. A 46-year-old male patient with identical ABO/Rh blood type, HLA matching score of 6/6, and MNC count of 2.63 × 10[8] cells/kg was enrolled. The patient did not present with serious AEs or GVHD during the 12-month study period. The patient's NIHSS score decreased from 9 to 1. Moreover, the Berg Balance Scale score increased from 0 to 48 and the Barthel index score from 0 to 90. This preliminary study showed that an adult patient with hemiplegia due to ischemic stroke completely recovered within 12 months after receiving allogeneic UCB therapy.",acute cerebral stroke| allogeneic| clinical trial| stem sell| umbilical cord blood,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

However, postoperative progressive spinal deformity complicates outcome in a subset of patients after surgery. We set out to determine whether the use of laminoplasty (LP) vs laminectomy (LM) has reduced the incidence of subsequent spinal deformity following intradural tumor resection at our institution.	We retrospectively reviewed the records of 238 consecutive patients undergoing resection of intradural tumor at a single institution. The incidence of subsequent progressive kyphosis or scoliosis, perioperative morbidity, and neurological outcome were compared between the LP and LM cohorts.	One hundred eighty patients underwent LM and 58 underwent LP. Patients were 46 +/- 19 years old with median modified McCormick score of 2. Tumors were intramedullary in 102 (43%) and extramedullary in 102 (43%). All baseline clinical, radiographic, and operative variables were similar between the LP and LM cohorts. LP was associated with a decreased mean length of hospitalization (5 vs 7 days; P = .002) and trend of decreased incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak (3% vs 9%; P = .14). Following LP vs LM, 5 (9%) vs 21 (12%) patients developed progressive deformity (P = .728) a mean of 14 months after surgery. The incidence of progressive deformity was also similar between LP vs LM in pediatric patients < 18 years of age (43% vs 36%), with preoperative scoliosis or loss of cervical/lumbar lordosis (28% vs 22%), or with intramedullary tumors (11% vs 11%).	LP for the resection of intradural spinal tumors was not associated with a decreased incidence of short-term progressive spinal deformity or improved neurological function. However, LP may be associated with a reduction in incisional cerebrospinal fluid leak. Longer-term follow-up is warranted to definitively assess the long-term effect of LP and the risk of deformity over time.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
931,31243575,European journal of pediatrics,Benefits of medical clowning in the treatment of young children with autism spectrum disorder,"We investigated the contribution of group therapy delivered by a medical clown to young children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). So far, scientific publications regarding medical clowning focus on general health advantages. The current study is the first controlled research examining the use of medical clowning in the therapy for children with ASD. Twenty-four children aged 2-6 years old with ASD enrolled in our special education intensive program were examined before and after group sessions with clown intervention (CI) and other intervention (OI). We tested stereotypic behaviors, verbal expression, play reciprocity, and social smiles. Data was collected during 12 weeks of intervention, and the trajectory of change was evaluated in addition to the pre-/post-intervention.Conclusion: improvement over time in all measures: Significant increase in word production, play reciprocity, and amount of social smiles during CI as compared with OI. We also found a reduction in frequency of stereotypic behaviors during and following CI as compared with before CI. These preliminary results indicate that medical clowning may be beneficial for young children with ASD, since it promotes communication and social reciprocity in a fun and lively interventional setting. What is Known: • Many therapies are used and proven as efficacious interventions for children with ASD. • So far, medical clowning was not tested as an intervention or therapy for ASD. What is New: • Medical clowning sessions with children with ASD elicited enhanced communication during the interventions as compared with other interventions. • Medical clowning sessions contributed to a decrease in frequency of stereotypic movements over time, in children with ASD.",Autism spectrum disorder| Complementary and alternative therapies for ASD| Medical clowning| Treatment,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
932,10725856,International journal of cancer,Comparison of three treatment options for single brain metastasis from lung cancer.,"Whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), and the combination of both treatment methods were used for the management of single brain metastasis from lung cancer. The purpose of this study is to compare these three different treatment options in terms of local response, survival, and quality of life. From June 1995 to July 1998, 70 lung cancer patients with new diagnosed single brain metastasis were treated with either WBRT alone (n = 29), or SRS alone (n = 23), or the combination of both methods (n = 18). Multiple endpoints, including survival, freedom from local progression (FFLP), freedom from new brain metastasis (FFNBM), local control, Karnofsky performance status (KPS), and causes of death, were measured from the date of treatment completion and compared using univariate and multivariate analyses. For patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, the median survivals were 5.7, 9.3, and 10.6 months, the median FFLP were 4.0, 6.9, and 8.6 months, the median FFNBM were 4.1, 6.7, and 8.6 months, and the local response rates were 55.6, 87.0, and 88.9%, respectively. Four of the 29 patients treated with WBRT-alone continued with progression of disease. The post treatment KPS showed improvement in 41.4, 82.6, and 88.9% of patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. The progression of new and/or recurred metastatic brain tumor as the cause of death accounted for 51.7%, 50. 0%, and 28.3% of the patients treated with WBRT-alone, SRS-alone, and SRS+WBRT, respectively. Univariate analyses showed that the significant differences among the three treatment arms were observed based on all of the above mentioned endpoints. However, the comparison between SRS-alone and SRS+WBRT groups indicated that adding WBRT only improves FFNBM (P = 0.0392). Cox regression analyses revealed no significant difference in both of the KPS (P = 0.1082) and causes of death (P = 0.081) among the three arms. Both SRS alone and SRS+WBRT seem better in prolonging life and improving quality of life than WBRT alone for patients with single brain metastasis from lung cancer. But the combined therapy did not show significant advantage over SRS alone in improving survival, enhancing local control, and quality of life except for a more favorable FFNBM. Further investigation via a randomized trial is needed to access the value of adding WBRT to SRS in the management of this group of patients. Int. J. Cancer (Radiat. Oncol.

Although systemic and local factors in combination with genetic abnormality have been considered in its etiopathogenesis, OPLL remains a poorly understood pathology. Surgical management of OPLL and the choice of the most appropriate treatment are still controversial issues. Here the authors report a series of OPLL-affected patients treated by 'only-fixation' technique.	Between June 2012 and June 2019, 52 patients having OPLL were treated by a surgical strategy involving only spinal fixation without any form of bone or soft tissue decompression. Facetal fixation for both the atlantoaxial and subaxial spine formed the basis of the surgical treatment. Clinical parameters, analysis of video recordings before and after surgery, and patient self-assessment were included in the analysis of outcome.	During the mean follow-up period there was an immediate postoperative and progressive recovery in symptoms in 51 patients. Of 14 patients who were wheelchair bound before surgery, 12 walked independently on follow-up assessment of 6 months. All patients had successful arthrodesis in the surgically treated segments. There were no infective- or implant-related complications.	Decision making in the surgical management of cervical OPLL is still controversial. The concept of spinal instability has been shown to be a nodal point in the pathogenesis of OPLL, and 'only-spinal fixation' can be considered a rationale for an appropriate surgical treatment.",Atlantoaxial instability| Facetal fixation| Ossification of posterior longitudinal ligament| Spinal instability,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We sought to investigate whether OSA increases the incidence of a composite of stroke or coronary heart disease (CHD) in women, and the role of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment on this association.	This was a prospective, observational study conducted in two Spanish teaching hospitals between 1998 and 2007. Consecutive women referred for suspected OSA and free of previous stroke and CHD were analyzed. Women with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) less than 10 comprised the control group, and those with an AHI greater than or equal to 10 were diagnosed with OSA and classified as CPAP-treated (adherence ≥ 4 h/d) or untreated (adherence < 4 h/d or not prescribed). The follow-up ended in December 2010.	A total of 967 women were studied (median follow-up, 6.8 yr; interquartile range, 5.2-8.2). The untreated OSA group showed a greater incidence rate of the composite outcome than the control group (2.19 vs. 0.54 per 100 person-years; P < 0.0005). Compared with the control group, the fully adjusted hazard ratios for the composite outcome incidence were 2.76 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.35-5.62) for the untreated OSA group, and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.43-1.95) for the CPAP-treated group. When the type of cardiovascular event was separately assessed, untreated OSA showed a stronger association with incident stroke (adjusted hazard ratio, 6.44; 95% CI, 1.46-28.3) than with CHD (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 0.76-4.09).

943,11482695,Acta neurochirurgica,Carotid endarterectomy: a new technique replacing internal shunts.,"Carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery. In cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient, the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed. However, the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems, such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt, the variability of time requested for the placement, the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery, and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt. For these reasons, most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts, while others do use them only in selected cases. The purpose of this work is to present, for the first time, a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt, connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow. This method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain.	407 consecutive patients, who underwent carotid endarterectomy between August 1992 and April 2000, were considered. 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation, demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time. In these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt.	In all the cases in whom the femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt was positioned, the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump. The use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy. None of the patients showed postoperative complications, except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery.	The results obtained, although to be confirmed by further studies, seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoral-carotid extraluminal shunt, which was simple to use and safe.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Eighty-one children (mean age 25.9 months) with autism (n=44) and DD (n=37) were assessed at pre- and post 1 year of intervention. Cognitive abilities and autism severity were measured by standardized tests. Three pre-intervention cognitive level groups: normal (IQ>90), borderline (70<IQ<89) and impaired (50<IQ<69) were examined. The impaired group had more severe autism symptoms than the borderline and the normal cognitive groups. However, following intervention the groups did not differ in the change in core autism symptoms. IQ scores increased significantly more in the autism group than in the DD group. IQ improvements correlated significantly with reduction in autism symptoms and mostly in stereotyped behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive ability in autism is associated with autism severity. Two distinct subtypes based on cognitive level are identified. However, baseline cognitive level cannot predict the progress rate in autism symptoms with intervention. Improvement of social-communicative behaviors and the intensive intervention are related to significant cognitive increments in autism.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
945,11328240,Acta psychiatrica Scandinavica,Bright light therapy of subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder in the workplace: morning vs. afternoon exposure,"OBJECTIVE: Bright light therapy in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been studied extensively. However, little attention has been given to subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder (SSAD) or the use of bright light in the workplace. Many patients using bright light boxes complain of the inconvenience of use. Much of this inconvenience involves the often-recommended early timing of the bright light therapy. Patients, who already have difficulty awakening, often have difficulty using the bright light therapy soon after awakening before going to work. If bright light could be used effectively in the workplace, the treatment would be more convenient; the improved convenience would probably improve compliance. In this study, we studied the effectiveness of bright light therapy in subjects with SSAD in the workplace, comparing morning bright light with afternoon bright light. METHOD: Morning and afternoon bright light treatment (2500 lux) were compared in 30 subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder patients using the bright light therapy in the workplace. Hamilton Depression Ratings and subjective measures of mood, energy, alertness and productivity were assessed before and after 2 weeks of light therapy. RESULTS: Both morning and evening bright light significantly decreased the depression ratings and improved the subjective mood, energy, alertness and productivity scores. However, there were no significant differences between the two times of administration of the bright light treatment. Both bright light treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Bright light given in the workplace improves subjective ratings of mood, energy, alertness and productivity in SSAD subjects. Morning and afternoon bright lights resulted in similar levels of improvement.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
946,36197214,Medicine,Impact of intensive rehabilitation on long-term prognosis after stroke: A Korean nationwide retrospective cohort study.,"An increasing number of patients are receiving rehabilitation after stroke. But the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke remains to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of intensive rehabilitation on the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke using data from the National Health Insurance Service database. This is a register-based, retrospective cohort study. Using data from the National Health Insurance Service database, we included the patients who received rehabilitation for stroke from 2006 to 2013. Of the 14,984 patients diagnosed with stroke, 2483 died within 1 year, and 2866 did not receive rehabilitation; hence, they were also excluded. The final sample included 9635 (49.2% men, 50.8% women) patients. After correcting for covariates, the Cox model was used to evaluate the effects of physical therapy (PT) and occupational therapy (OT) on survival. We estimated the independent contribution of each factor to the risk of death from the initiation of rehabilitation. Significant differences in mortality were observed according to age, Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), income level, and stroke type. Patients with stroke who received both PT and OT had a better long-term prognosis than those who received either treatment alone. Therapy performed by a physical therapist with more than 120 hours of training effectively improved the patients' long-term prognosis. Intensive PT and OT will help improve the long-term prognosis of patients with stroke. This study emphasizes the importance of intensive rehabilitation in these patients.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
947,20052730,Cancer,Should extrapulmonary small cell cancer be managed like small cell lung cancer?,"The aim of this study was to determine if extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas (EPSCC) should be managed using protocols similar to those for small cell lung cancer (SCLC).	Treatment strategies, survival, patterns of failure, and prognostic factors for patients with EPSCC were analyzed retrospectively at a large cancer center. SCLC was excluded by thoracic computed tomography (75%) or chest radiography (25%).	Of 120 eligible patients, 70% had limited disease (LD). Treatment modalities included chemotherapy (n = 82; 68%), radiotherapy (RT) (n = 80; 67%), and surgery (n = 41, 34%). The median survival for patients with LD and extensive disease was 1.4 years and 0.7 years, respectively. Gynecologic (n = 31) and gastrointestinal (n = 28) were the most common primary tumor sites. Gynecologic and head and neck primary tumor sites had better 1-year survival than other sites (P = .019 and 0.005, respectively). Brain metastasis was the site of first distant failure in 4.1% of patients versus 35% for soft tissue metastases. The lifetime risk of brain metastasis was 13%. Definitive RT (P = .004), LD (P = .028), and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) (P = .022) were found to be positive prognostic factors and weight loss (P < .001) was a negative prognostic factor on multivariate analysis.	Patients with EPSCC usually experienced short survival, often with early distant metastasis. Although PCI was associated with improved overall survival, brain metastasis was less frequent than in patients with SCLC, and therefore the potential benefit of PCI was less than in patients with SCLC. Definitive chemoradiotherapy was associated with better outcomes and should be delivered whenever feasible.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The Japanese journal of anesthesiology,[Epidural blood patch as a successful treatment of Barrè-Lièou syndrome: report of two cases].,"Barrè-Lièou syndrome accompanies neurological symptoms after neck sprain, and is often difficult to treat. We describe two young men with various neurological symptoms after traffic accident, who were diagnosed with Barrè-Lièou syndrome. Both case 1 (41-year-old man) and case 2 (34-year-old man) showed no abnormal findings in head and cervical X-ray, CT-scan and MRI. Only radionuclide cisternography (RNC) showed cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak into epidural space at thoracolumbar level. Three months (case 1) and four years (case 2) had passed after each accident. Two patients underwent epidural blood patch (EBP) for total of three times. The average volumes of the blood used for EBP were 30 ml (case 1) and 24 ml (case 2). The procedure improved various symptoms except for neck stiffness and dizziness. EBP had led to low back pain, which disappeared within three days. CSF leak vanished in RNC after EBP. Severe complication, for example epidural infection or neurological disorders due to hematoma, was not noticed. While neural blockade did not relieve pain before EBP, we could get good effect from neural blockade for remaining symptoms after EBP. We consider that Barrè-Lièou syndrome is due to CSF leak and EBP may be one of the useful treatments.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We examined whether negative age stereotypes, which older individuals tend to assimilate from the environment across their lifespan, contributed to an increased risk of developing four psychiatric conditions, and, if so, whether this risk was reduced through active coping.	The sample consisted of participants aged 55 years and older, free of the psychiatric conditions at baseline, drawn from the National Health and Resilience in Veterans Study, a nationally representative sample. New cases of posttraumatic stress disorder, suicidal ideation, generalized anxiety disorder, and major depressive disorder were assessed during three waves spanning a four-year period.	As predicted, participants holding more-negative age stereotypes were more likely to develop the psychiatric conditions, and their engagement in active coping reduced the risk of their developing these conditions.	Our findings suggest that prevention and treatment efforts designed to reduce psychiatric conditions in later life may benefit from bolstering active coping as well as positive age stereotypes.",Age stereotypes| Aging| Anxiety| Coping| Depression| Mental health| PTSD| Social determinants| Suicidal ideation,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We used a large sample (n=1,226) of alcohol-dependent participants entering the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism-sponsored COMBINE (Combining Medications and Behavioral Interventions) Study, a multisite clinical trial of pharmacological (naltrexone [ReVia] and acamprosate [Campral]) and behavioral interventions, to examine the effects of specific treatment combinations on nondrinking functional outcomes. We assessed the outcomes at baseline and at the end of 16 weeks of alcohol treatment and again at the 26-week and/or 52-week postrandomization follow-ups.	(1) Drinking and secondary outcomes were significantly related, especially at the follow-up periods. A higher percentage of heavy drinking days, more drinks per drinking day, and lower percentage of days abstinent were associated with lower quality-of-life measures. (2) All nondrinking outcomes showed improvement at the end of 16 weeks of treatment and most maintained improvement over the 26-week and 52-week follow-ups. Only two measures returned to pretreatment levels at 52 weeks: percentage of days paid for work and physical health. Improvements of nondrinking outcomes remained even after adjusting for posttreatment heavy drinking status. (3) Although nondrinking outcomes showed overall improvement, specific pharmacological and behavioral treatment combinations were not differentially effective on specific secondary outcomes.	In the current study, changes that resulted from treatment were multidimensional, and improvements in nondrinking outcomes reflected the overall significant improvement in drinking but they were not differentiated between treatment combination groups. Findings from this study support the importance of including secondary nondrinking outcomes in clinical alcohol-treatment trials.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

953,17762736,Neurosurgery,Preoperative embolization of intracranial arteriovenous malformations with Onyx,"OBJECTIVE: Preoperative embolization in accordance with multimodal therapies for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is generally the first step in treatment and may result in complete obliteration. The Onyx liquid embolic system (Micro Therapeutics, Inc., Irvine, CA) may offer advantages for intranidal targeted embolization and microsurgical resection. We present our experience in the combined treatment of intracranial AVMs using Onyx embolization and neurosurgical resection. METHODS: We treated a total of 47 patients for compact intracranial AVMs that were located in the frontal or frontoparietal area (16 patients); temporal, temporoparietal, or temporo-occipital regions (12 patients); parietal or parieto-occipital areas (8 patients); occipital regions (8 patients); had basal ganglia involvement (2 patients); and was cerebellar (1 patient). The Spetzler-Martin grading scale values were as follows: 25 patients were Grades I or II, 10 patients were Grade III, and 12 patients were Grades IV or V. Twenty-three AVMs were located in eloquent brain regions. RESULTS: After we performed final embolizations, the mean nidus reduction was 84%. Seven patients had new, nondisabling neurological deficits, and four patients had new, disabling neurological deficits after embolization. Periprocedurally, five vessel perforations and four stuck microcatheters were encountered without clinical deficits. In two patients, delayed hemorrhage after embolization occurred with good clinical outcome. We completely resected 46 AVMs; in one patient, we detected an AVM on postoperative angiography. The mean operative time was 4.7 hours, and the mean blood loss was 455 mL. Clinical status worsened postoperatively in 14 patients. Angiographic and clinical follow-up examinations were available for 42 patients (89%); the average follow-up period was 13 months. We found no relapse of arteriovenous shunt. Fourteen patients improved clinically after discharge. Of the 42 patients followed up, 23 individuals had no neurological deficit, 16 had a nondisabling deficit, and three had a disabling deficit. CONCLUSION: Preoperative use of the Onyx liquid embolic system in cerebral AVM treatment allows profound occlusion by targeted embolization and provides a basis for safe neurosurgical resection.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We determined whether surgical factors were of prognostic value for long-term neurodevelopment in children surviving surgery for NEC (SNEC).	SNEC patients born between 1996 and 2002 were tested for verbal (VIQ), performance (PIQ) and total (TIQ) intelligence using Wechsler's Intelligence Scale for Children, Third Edition, Dutch Version, and motor skills using the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC). Neonatal and surgical data were obtained retrospectively to assess prognostic factors.	19 patients (12 boys), median age 9.9 years (range 6.2-13.1), gestational age 31.0 weeks (range 25.2-40), birth weight 1 250 g (range 780-3 175) were evaluated. Infants with an enterostomy (n=14) scored lower on intelligence than children with a primary anastomosis (n=5): VIQ 85 ± 12 vs. 101 ± 15, p=0.04; PIQ 79 ± 13 vs. 92 ± 11, p=0.06; TIQ 82 ± 11 vs. 97 ± 13, p=0.04. Motor skills were either suspect or clinically impaired in 74%. Clinical classification of results suggest more children in the enterostomy group had a performance rated as clinically impaired compared to the primary anastomosis group, although no statistical difference in M-ABC score was found. There were no differences between primary anastomosis and enterostomy patients with regard to gestational age, birth weight, comorbidities, preoperative Bell stage, residual small and large bowel lengths, inotropic medication, duration of ventilatory support, NICU and hospital stay, and physical exam data on follow-up. However, a selection bias could not be ruled out.	The results suggest that an enterostomy in SNEC patients could be associated with worse neurodevelopmental outcomes by the age of 6-13 years compared to a primary anastomosis, although the severity of illness was comparable between both groups. Further studies are needed to prevent selection bias and to elucidate the impact of abdominal surgical factors on neurodevelopmental outcome and the underlying pathophysiology.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Overall, 33 patients with organic erectile dysfunction underwent penile implant surgery during the study period. The Titan OTR inflatable penile implants were inserted using a penoscrotal approach. Patient and partner satisfaction was assessed with the Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction (EDITS) questionnaire.	One implant was removed because of infection, and three patients underwent revision surgery due to problems with autoinflation, deflation, and a displaced reservoir, respectively. In all cases the problems were solved and the implants were salvaged. Further complications included one patient with haematoma and sustained scrotal pain, one patient with meatal stenosis, and four patients with infections not related to the implant. In total, 30 EDITS questionnaires were administered and 26 (87%) were completed. Twenty-two patients (85%) reported being satisfied with the implant and two (8%) were dissatisfied. Twenty-four patients (92%) would recommend a penile implant to someone with a similar medical condition. Eighteen patients (72%) believed that their partner was satisfied with the implant. Nineteen patients (76%) felt that the process of achieving an erection with the implant was natural.	Although it is important to inform patients about potential problems such as infection, pain and mechanical failure, the results show that inflatable penile implants are a good treatment choice for erectile dysfunction when conservative measures have failed.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

However, few studies have used validated functional outcome measures to report the surgical results beyond 3 years. The authors analyzed data obtained from the McGill Rhizotomy Database to determine the long-term impact of lumbosacral dorsal rhizotomy on fine motor skills. The study population comprised children with debilitating spasticity who underwent SPR and were evaluated by a multidisciplinary team preoperatively, at 6 months and 1 year postoperatively. Quantitative standardized assessments of upper extremity function were obtained using the fine motor skills section of the Peabody Developmental Motor Scales (PDMS) test. Of 70 patients who met the entry criteria for the study, 45 and 25 completed the 3- and 5-year assessments, respectively. Statistical analysis demonstrated significant improvements in grasping, hand use, eye-hand coordination, and manual dexterity at 1 year after SPR. More importantly, all improvements were maintained at 3 and 5 years following SPR. This study supports that significant improvements in upper extremity fine motor function using the PDMS evaluative measure are present after SPR and that these suprasegmental benefits are durable.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

In nine of the children who had not required shunts the distribution of intelligence was within the normal range. The need for a shunt was significantly related to the presence of craniolacunae and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Seven of the 74 shunt-treated children had suffered ventriculitis, meningitis or septicaemia, and their intelligence was significantly worse than the others. In the 67 shunt-treated children who had not suffered infection, intelligence was significantly related to the thickness of the pallium when the shunt was inserted during the first four weeks of life, and to the sensory level of the lesion recorded at birth. Intelligence was not related to the function of the shunt at time of assessment, to the number of revisions of the shunt, or to the rate of increase in head size during the first four weeks of life. It is concluded that the best indication of later intelligence can be gained at birth from the thickness of the pallium and the sensory level of the lesion.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

In response to the recognized paucity, a structured exercise program was developed and implemented for residents of a Community Care Unit in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Six residents participated in the program over a period of three months. This paper reports the findings of a qualitative study. A focus group interview was conducted with the resident participants (n=6), the exercise physiologists who developed and implemented the program (n=2), and nursing staff involved in implementing and supporting the program (n=4). Analysis of the data collected revealed that four main themes had emerged: the individual nature of the program, physical improvement, group dynamics, and future plans. The findings of this study suggest that involvement in the program produced very positive outcomes, most notably in the physical fitness of residents. The individual nature of the program which enabled gradual participation, and the cohesive approach of the group as a whole were considered very important factors contributing to the overall success. Furthermore, the participants planned to continue with some form of physical activity in the future. The potential value of regular exercise for patients experiencing a mental illness has significant implications for nursing and requires further research exploration.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
968,15185269,The International journal of eating disorders,Reduction of food cravings through concurrent visuospatial processing.,"Two experiments adopted a working memory approach to evaluate the effectiveness of visuospatial tasks as a technique for reducing food cravings.	Dieting and non-dieting women were asked to form images of both food-related and nonfood items, induced by either pictures (Experiment 1) or verbal cues (Experiment 2). They were required to concurrently perform one of three tasks that load on the visuospatial sketch pad of working memory: saccadic eye movements, dynamic visual noise, or spatial tapping.	In support of the working memory model of limited visuospatial capacity, concurrent visuospatial activity reduced the vividness of food-related images which, in turn, reduced the intensity of the associated craving. The same pattern of results was observed across dieters and non-dieters and for all stimulus types.	Visuospatial tasks may provide a useful technique for the treatment of food craving episodes in both nonclinical and clinical populations.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
969,28707407,Psychology and psychotherapy,"Symptom fluctuations, self-esteem, and cohesion during group cognitive behaviour therapy for early psychosis.","Group cohesion has been linked to positive changes in self-esteem and in symptoms during group psychotherapy in people with psychosis. These changes may be linked to changes in symptoms as fluctuations in self-esteem have been linked to symptom fluctuations.	We aimed to determine the relationship between these three factors - group cohesion, self-esteem, and symptoms - during group cognitive behaviour therapy for psychosis (GCBTp). We hypothesized that group cohesion would precede changes in symptoms and self-esteem and that improvements in self-esteem would precede improvements in symptoms.	This is an uncontrolled longitudinal study recruiting from a convenience sample within two early psychosis clinics.	Sixty-six individuals from first episode of psychosis treatment programmes participated in this study and received 24 sessions of a validated GCBTp protocol. Participants answered a brief questionnaire at the end of each session, measuring their group cohesion, self-esteem, and perception of their symptoms as worse, same, or better than usual.	Orthogonal polynomial contrasts for time effects were estimated with a mixed model for repeated measures with a random cluster effect and revealed a quartic trend regarding changes in symptoms over the 24 sessions. Self-esteem, symptoms, and group cohesion were strongly linked during a given session. Also, self-esteem changes predicted changes in symptoms up to two sessions later, and symptoms changes predicted self-esteem changes at the next session. Group cohesion preceded improvements in both self-esteem and symptoms; self-esteem also predicted improvements in group cohesion.	These results suggest that self-esteem and symptoms influence each other during therapy, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other. Group cohesion also appears to be an essential prerequisite to positive changes in self-esteem and symptoms during GCBTp.	This study emphasizes the interrelation between self-esteem improvements and symptom improvements, with improvements in one leading to improvements in the other, during group CBT for psychosis. Group cohesion, in this study, is a predictor of self-esteem and symptom improvements, suggesting that a special attention should be given to developing a strong alliance and group cohesion early on during CBT for psychosis.",cognitive behaviour therapy| cohesion| psychosis| self-esteem| symptoms,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
970,24727717,The Journal of nervous and mental disease,How does addressing patient's defenses help to repair alliance ruptures in psychodynamic psychotherapy?: An exploratory study.,"Interpreting or addressing defenses is an important aspect of psychoanalytic technique. Previous research has shown that therapist addressing defenses (TADs) can produce a positive effect on alliance. The potential value of TADs during the process of alliance rupture and resolution has not yet been documented. We selected patients (n = 17) undertaking a short-term dynamic psychotherapy in which the therapeutic alliance, measured with the Helping Alliance Questionnaire and monitored after each session, showed a pattern of rupture and resolution. Two control sessions (5 and 15) were also selected. Presence of TADs was examined in each therapist interpretation. Compared with control sessions, rupture sessions were characterized by fewer TADs and especially fewer TADs addressing specifically intermediate-essentially neurotic-defenses. Resolution sessions were characterized by more TADs addressing specifically intermediate defenses. This confirms the link between therapist technique and alliance process in psychodynamic psychotherapy.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
971,21302192,Minimally invasive neurosurgery : MIN,Endovascular treatment of vertebral artery dissection using stents and coils: its pitfall and technical considerations.,"There are various options for the treatment of vertebral artery dissection aneurysms (VADA). Treatment with stents may be an effective method to treat VADA involving the posterior inferior cerebellar artery (PICA) and dissection of the dominant vertebral artery (VA). In this article, our personal experience of the treatment of VADAs by using stents and coils is reported.	Since 1998, 26 cases of VADA have been treated by endovascular surgery by the first author. Of these cases, 6 cases were treated using stents, 3 of which were treated using stent and coils, 2 patients were treated using double overlapping stents, and the remaining one patient was treated using a single stent.	In all patients, dissection aneurysms were successfully covered by stents. There was one complication: an intraprocedural rupture during additional coil insertion without neurological deterioration. Follow-up angiography was performed in all 5 surviving patients except for one patient who died due to the severity of his original subarachnoid hemorrhage (mean duration of follow-up angiography 22.8 months, range 15-57 months). Total or subtotal disappearance of the VADA was achieved in all 5 cases. At one year after the treatment, all 5 surviving patients remained clinically stable without any neurological deficit.	Treatment using stents is an effective alternative for the treatment of VA dissecting aneurysms, especially for lesions of the dominant VA or involving the PICA. However, additional coil insertion should be performed very carefully and may be avoided if stagnation of contrast material is achieved after overlapping stenting.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Management to minimize the risk of aspiration and improve swallow safety post-stroke includes the treatment of thickened liquids (TL), an established bolus modification intervention. Despite widespread use, there is a lack of robust empirical evidence and minimal patient evidence as to the experience and acceptability of using thickeners by people who experience dysphagia after a stroke.	To explore people with swallowing disorders post-stroke experiences of and acceptability regarding the bolus modification treatment of thickened liquids.	A qualitative, descriptive study exploring the experiences of individuals given TL after their stroke. A purposive sample of 14 adults was obtained with data collection and generation through the medium of individual semi-structured interviews. Inductive thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.	Three overarching themes of 'uncertainty', 'an unpleasant experience' and 'a trade-off' were identified. These themes highlight that participants disliked TL and this dislike may have impacted clinically in terms of adherence, hydration and quality of life. Lack of sensory appeal was important in framing patient dislike. Participants' involvement in and understanding of reasons for prescription of TL was poor leading to uncertainty regarding the treatment. Notwithstanding, some participants felt it was necessary for their stroke recovery.	TL can be considered a burdensome treatment from multiple perspectives including product palatability, treatment uncertainty and treatment adherence issues. Despite intensely disliking this treatment, some patients ultimately understand why the treatment is prescribed. Improvements in product palatability are required in order to improve adherence and patient quality of life. Consideration of other treatment options and newer products to manage aspiration post-stroke is also warranted.",dysphagia| evidence-based practice| patient evidence| stroke| thickened liquids,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Five individuals with very mild dementia and 4 spouses who served as coaches attended 14 group treatment sessions. Therapists use educational strategies and learning activities packets to teach memory notebook use. At posttreatment, coaches report fewer symptoms of depression, and participants with very mild dementia report greater confidence in ability to obtain support. Modified laboratory memory testing reveals that participants with dementia demonstrate improved posttreatment memory scores because of increased note-taking behavior and more frequent referencing of notes. Although more frequent everyday memory strategies use is reported at posttreatment, this does not translate into reports of fewer everyday memory failures or greater everyday independence for the participants with dementia. This study demonstrates that a multidyad group intervention can successfully be used to teach patients with very mild dementia to use a memory notebook, with beneficial effects for both members of the care dyad.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Most studies have focused on anterior circulation strokes; therefore, little is known regarding the optimal anesthesia type for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	To compare clinical and angiographic outcomes between monitored anesthesia care (MAC) and general anesthesia (GA) in patients presenting with vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes.	Retrospective, matched, case-control study of consecutive vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes treated with endovascular therapy at 2 academic institutions. The study took place between September 2005 and September 2015 at University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Stroke Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and between September 2010 and September 2015 at the Marcus Stroke and Neuroscience Center at Grady Memorial Hospital, Atlanta, Georgia. Patients requiring emergent intubation prior to endovascular therapy were excluded. The remaining patients were categorized into (1) MAC and (2) elective intubation for the procedure (elective GA). Patients who converted from MAC to GA during the procedure were included in the MAC group. The 2 groups were matched for age, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, and glucose levels. Baseline characteristics and outcomes were compared.	The primary outcome measure was the shift in the degree of disability among the 2 groups as measured by the modified Rankin scale at 90 days.	A total of 215 patients underwent endovascular therapy for vertebrobasilar occlusion strokes during the study period. Thirty-nine patients were excluded owing to emergent pre-endovascular therapy intubation. Sixty-three patients had MAC (36%) and 113 patients had GA (64%). The conversion rate from MAC to GA was 13% (n = 8). After matching, 61 pairs of patients (n = 122) underwent primary analysis. The 2 groups were well balanced in terms of baseline characteristics. Median age was 69 years (interquartile range, 60-75 years) in the MAC group vs 67 years (interquartile range, 55.5-78.5 years) in the GA group (P = .83). Fifty-four percent of the patients in the MAC group were men vs 41% in the GA group (P = .44). When compared with the elective GA group, patients who underwent the procedure with MAC had similar rates of successful reperfusion, good clinical outcomes, hemorrhagic complications, and mortality. The modality of anesthesia was not associated with any significant changes in the modified Rankin scale score distribution (MAC: OR, 1.52; 95% CI, 0.80-2.90; P = .19).	In endovascular therapy for acute posterior circulation stroke, MAC is feasible and appears to be as safe and effective as GA.

The EVD is secured using a single permanent suture, creating a box stitch around the exit site attached to a modified roman sandal. Multiple knots are tied after each loop to avoid 'telescoping,' loosening, and pullout.	In 12 years of high-volume pediatric practice by one of the authors, only one drain has broken, and none have pulled out.	The modified roman sandal technique tightly secures EVDs against pullout.

976,26307942,Drug and alcohol dependence,Outcomes from a computer-assisted intervention simultaneously targeting cannabis and tobacco use,"BACKGROUND: Cannabis users frequently report concurrent tobacco use, and tobacco use is associated with poorer outcomes during treatment for cannabis use disorders (CUD). Interventions that simultaneously target both tobacco and cannabis use disorders may enhance cessation outcomes for either or both substances. METHODS: This study evaluated an intervention integrating highly effective treatments for cannabis and tobacco use disorders. Thirty-two participants meeting diagnostic criteria for CUD and reporting daily tobacco use were enrolled in a 12-week computer-assisted behavioral treatment for CUD. Participants were encouraged to participate in a tobacco intervention that included a computer-assisted behavioral treatment tailored for tobacco and cannabis co-users, and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT). Cannabis and tobacco outcomes were evaluated using descriptive statistics and were compared to a historical control group that received treatment for CUD but not tobacco. RESULTS: Participants achieved 3.6±4.3 consecutive weeks of cannabis abstinence, which was comparable to the historical control group (3.1±4.4). A majority of the sample (78%) completed at least one tobacco module and 44% initiated NRT. Over half (56%) initiated tobacco quit attempts, and 28% were tobacco abstinent for at least two consecutive weeks. Participants showed greater reduction in tobacco use (cigarettes per day) than the historical control group, but differences in tobacco abstinence rates during the final month of treatment were not statistically significant (12.5% vs. 4%). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that providing a tobacco intervention during treatment for CUD is feasible and may positively impact tobacco use without negatively affecting cannabis use outcomes.",Cannabis| Co-use| Computer-assisted| Incentives| Tobacco| Treatment,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Optical Express, London, United Kingdom.	Retrospective case series.	The study analyzed data from 5 years of follow-up of amblyopic eyes that were implanted with iris-fixated pIOLs and had a preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) of 6/15 or worse. Visual acuity, refraction, endothelial cell count, and complications were assessed.	Data for 103 eyes were analyzed as 2 groups. Group 1 comprised 82 eyes with myopia or myopic astigmatism, and Group 2 contained 21 eyes with hyperopia or hyperopic astigmatism. The mean preoperative sphere in Group 1 was -13.42 diopters (D) ± 5.62 (SD) with a mean cylinder of -2.35 ± 1.75 D. In Group 2, the mean sphere and cylinder were +6.77 ± 1.91 D and -2.63 ± 2.43 D, respectively. The mean CDVA improved from 0.51 ± 0.15 logMAR to 0.34 ± 0.16 logMAR (P<.001) in Group 1 and from 0.54 ± 0.17 logMAR to 0.46 ± 0.14 logMAR in Group 2 (P<.005). The safety index was 1.48 in Group 1 and 1.19 in Group 2. The efficacy index was 1.21 in Group 1 and 1.00 in Group 2. The mean gain in CDVA was statistically significantly greater in Group 1 (0.17 ± 0.14 logMAR) than in Group 2 (0.08 ± 0.11 logMAR). Two or more lines of CDVA were gained by 48.8% of eyes in Group 1 and by 19.0% of eyes in Group 2.

We retrospectively sampled and analyzed 31 patients treated for ruptured Distal anterior cerebral artery (DACA) aneurysms from a larger sample of 250 patients treated for ruptured aneurysms between July 2018 and July 2021. The outcomes of patients who underwent clipping and EVT were compared using chi-square tests. T-tests were used for univariate analysis and a logistic regression analysis was used to determine the risk factors affecting outcomes.	Of the 31 patients, 20 were treated with clipping and 11 with EVT. Patients treated with EVT had a mean age of 35.45 ± 6.66. The mean age of the clipping group was 44.4 ± 6.94 years (p=0.002). Intraoperative rupture was significantly more common in the clipping group (p=0.025). There were no significant differences in the postoperative incidence of vasospasm or hydrocephalus (p=0.12). Modified Rankin Scale scores (p=0.017) and Glasgow Outcome Scale scores (p=0.02) both at discharge and 6-month follow-ups were significantly better in the EVT group than in the clipping group. Length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) was 9.27 ± 2.6 days following EVT and 23.60 ± 6.29 following clipping (p=0.001). Age (p=0.0136), Hunt and Hess grade (p=0.02), and the occurrence of intraprocedural rupture (p=0.009) were found to significantly affect outcomes.	The outcomes of EVT were better than those for clipping and required a shorter stay in the ICU and the hospital. This may be partially attributable to the dual-trained neurovascular surgeon who performed the procedures.

980,29408857,PloS one,Intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after implantation of the Medina® Embolization Device depends on aneurysm neck coverage.,"Flow disruption achieved by braided intrasaccular implants is a novel treatment strategy for cerebrovascular aneurysms. We hypothesized that the degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption can be quantified in vitro and is influenced by device position across the aneurysm neck. We tested this hypothesis using the Medina® Embolization Device (MED).	Ten different patient-specific elastic vascular models were manufactured. Models were connected to a pulsatile flow circuit, filled with a blood-mimicking fluid and treated by two operators using a single MED. Intra-aneurysmal flow velocity was measured using conventional and high-frequency digital subtraction angiography (HF-DSA) before and after each deployment. Aneurysm neck coverage by the implanted devices was assessed with flat detector computed tomography on a three-point Likert scale.	A total of 80 individual MED deployments were performed by the two operators. The mean intra-aneurysmal flow velocity reduction after MED implantation was 33.6% (27.5-39.7%). No significant differences in neck coverage (p = 0.99) or flow disruption (p = 0.84) were observed between operators. The degree of flow disruption significantly correlated with neck coverage (ρ = 0.42, 95% CI: 0.21-0.59, p = 0.002) as well as with neck area (ρ = -0,35, 95% CI: -0.54 --0.13, p = 0.024). On multiple regression analysis, both neck coverage and total neck area were independent predictors of flow disruption.	The degree of intra-aneurysmal flow disruption after MED implantation can be quantified in vitro and varies considerably between different aneurysms and different device configurations. Optimal device coverage across the aneurysm neck improves flow disruption and may thus contribute to aneurysm occlusion.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
981,22040605,International psychogeriatrics,Does theatre improve the quality of life of people with dementia?,"BACKGROUND: A new communication method, the ""Veder method"", has recently been developed. Caregivers are trained to apply this method in a group activity (""living-room theatre activity"") for people with dementia in which theatrical stimuli are used in combination with proven emotion-oriented care methods. The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the added value of the Veder method group activity compared to a regular reminiscence group activity and to investigate whether professional carers can achieve the same effects with the Veder method as professional actors. METHODS: A quasi-experimental three-group design was used. Experimental group 1 (E1; n = 65) joined a living-room theatre activity offered by trained professional caregivers. Experimental group 2 (E2; n = 31) joined a living-room theatre activity offered by professional actors. The control group (n = 55) received a usual reminiscence group activity. Behavior, mood and aspects of quality of life were measured using standardized observation scales at three points in time: (T1) pretest; (T2) during the intervention and; (T3) post-test, two hours after the intervention. RESULTS: During the intervention, significant differences were found in favor of the group that was offered a living-room theatre activity by actors (E2) on different aspects of behavior, mood and quality of life. At post-test, people in E2 were more alert compared to the control group. Moreover, they recalled more memories and showed less socially isolated behavior compared to the control group.

The 41 Libyan patients who volunteered to take part in the study were first assessed using the PTSD Checklist. They attended workshops on PTSD symptoms, stress management techniques, and communication skills on three successive days after which they were asked to answer the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations two weeks after they completed the workshops. Among the 39% of the participants who were diagnosed with PTSD prior to the intervention, 15% met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD after the intervention. The preintervention scores were consistently higher than the postintervention scores, and there were significant differences in the PTSD Checklist total score and the re-experiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptom scores. This study concluded that in mass-trauma events such as war and natural disasters, PTSD education can reduce the PTSD symptoms of those affected. Whether the benefits of psychoeducation on the participants are long term or short term is recommended for further study due to the limitations imposed by the willingness of the participants to participate, the amount of time they are willing to stay with the program, and the duration of the psychoeducation program itself.",Mental health| PTSD| anxiety| coping strategies| psychoeducation| stress| victim response| violence| violence risk,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A diet quality index based on the 2005 Swedish Nutrition Recommendations and the Swedish Dietary Guidelines was created and included six dietary components: saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids, fish and shellfish, dietary fiber, fruit and vegetables, and sucrose. The index ranked 17126 participants (59% women) of the population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer cohort (Sweden) on their dietary intakes. Total index score was categorized as low, medium or high. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to model associations between index score categories and index components with risk of incident CV events, with adjustment for potential confounders. The incidence of first CV events (non-fatal or fatal myocardial infarction or ischemic stroke or death from ischemic heart disease) was monitored from baseline (1991-1996) until December 31, 2008; 703 CV events occurred in women and 1093 in men.	A high diet quality was associated with decreased risk of CV events when compared to a low diet quality.

988,30035586,Journal of consulting and clinical psychology,Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa? Illness severity and duration are unrelated to outcomes from cognitive behaviour therapy.,"The present study aimed to examine whether Anorexia Nervosa (AN) illness severity or duration is associated with retention or treatment response in outpatient, enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-E).	Patients with a confirmed AN diagnosis (N = 134) completed measures of eating disorder symptoms and quality of life, and had their BMI objectively measured before, during, and after treatment. We evaluated whether illness severity or duration predicted treatment outcomes, using longitudinal regression models.	Greater levels of illness severity and duration were not associated with poorer treatment outcomes.	Patients with more severe or long-standing AN illness did just as well in CBT-E as any other patient starting treatment. Therefore, classifying individuals as 'severe and enduring' appears to lack clinical utility in CBT-E. Clinicians should continue to administer evidence-supported treatments such as CBT-E for patients with AN, regardless of duration or severity of AN illness.

989,28124452,Early intervention in psychiatry,An uncontrolled trial of multi-component care for first-episode psychosis: Effects on social cognition,"Growing evidence suggests that specialized, multi-component treatment programmes produce improvements in numerous outcomes among individuals with first-episode psychosis. However, these programmes often lack interventions specifically designed to address deficits in social cognition. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such programmes in addressing deficits in social cognition that accompany psychotic disorders. We investigated the effect of participation in a multi-component treatment programme on social cognition among 71 individuals with first-episode psychosis. Participants experienced gains in emotion processing, social knowledge, social perception and theory of mind. However, after controlling for multiple comparisons, these improvements were limited to theory of mind and recognition of social cues in low emotion interactions. Although our findings should be interpreted cautiously, they raise the possibility that individuals participating in multi-component treatment programmes for first-episode psychosis without interventions specifically targeting social cognition may still experience gains in social cognition.",first-episode psychosis| multi-component care| social cognition,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
990,35076903,Eating and weight disorders : EWD,Phase 2 of family-based treatment: an exploratory assessment of clinician practices,"PURPOSE: In manualized family-based treatment (FBT) for eating disorders, phase 1 of the 3-phase treatment-during which parents are put in control of eating-related issues-is perhaps the most critical phase, and is comprehensively addressed in the manual. Phase 2, during which control over eating is gradually returned to the patient, is more variable and the manual dedicates less space to this phase. The purpose of the current exploratory study was to assess Phase 2 practices of clinicians providing FBT and to compare these practices to the guidance offered in the manual. METHODS: In the current study, a survey assessing Phase 2 practices was sent to clinicians. Twenty-seven providers responded. Two providers reported that they did not provide FBT in an outpatient setting. One reported not currently providing outpatient FBT but had in the past. The remaining providers were currently providing FBT in an outpatient setting. RESULTS: No items addressing the core interventions of Phase 2, including encouraging age-appropriate independent eating, were endorsed by 100% of respondents as being addressed 100% of the time in Phase 2. CONCLUSION: Responses reflected some adherence to the manual, along with examples of therapist drift and incorporation of therapeutic interventions that are not described in the FBT manual. Adherence to manualized treatments may improve outcome for some patients, while allowing for flexibility to address clinical situations that are not addressed in the manual. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V.

The present study investigated whether optimism can be increased by imagining a best possible self (BPS). Effects were compared to a control group in which participants imagined their daily activities (DA).	In order to minimize inter-individual differences in content of imagery, participants constructed their BPS according to 3 domains, namely a personal, relational, and professional domain. All participants were instructed to practice their imagery exercise for 5 min per day over a period of two weeks. Effects on optimism and mood were measured after one session, after one week and after two weeks.	Results indicated that BPS imagery led to significantly larger increases in optimism as compared to DA imagery, after one session and over a two week period. Effects on optimism remained after controlling for possible mediation by the change in positive mood.	In order to test the effectiveness of our BPS imagery intervention we relied exclusively on self-report measures.

DESIGN: A cluster-unit crossover intervention trial involving four conditions: morning bright light, evening bright light, all-day bright light, and minimum standard light. SETTING: The common areas of two geriatric units in a psychiatric hospital and a dementia-specific residential care facility. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six older adults with dementia. INTERVENTION: Ambient bright light of approximately 2,500 lux, delivered through a low-glare lighting system installed in the dining and activity areas. Participant exposure averaged 2.5 to 3.0 hours for the morning and evening interventions and 8.4 hours for the all-day intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Nighttime sleep using wrist actigraphy and daytime activity using nonobtrusive daytime observations. RESULTS: Night-time sleep increased significantly in participants exposed to morning and all-day light, with the increase most prominent in participants with severe or very severe dementia (mean increase 16 minutes (P=.008) for morning, and 14 minutes (P=.01) for all-day). Morning light produced a mean phase advance of 29 minutes (P=.02) and evening light a mean phase delay of 15 minutes (P=.06). Effects on daytime sleepiness were inconsistent, and the number of sleep bouts, mesor, amplitude, intradaily variability, and interdaily stability were not significantly different, indicating that the overall strength of day and night activity rhythms did not change significantly under any treatment condition.

The British Columbia Cancer Agency provincial database identified 2268 patients presenting with stage III NSCLC between January 1, 1990 and December 31, 2000. Of these, 120 patients received radical CRT, forming the study cohort. Variables analyzed included gender, age, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, stage, histology, sites of metastasis, and survival. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed.	The study cohort comprised 59 men and 61 women, median age 54.5 years. There were 74 stage IIIA and 46 stage IIIB cases. Histologic subtypes were squamous cell carcinoma (n = 29), adenocarcinoma (n = 53), and other non-squamous histologies (n = 38). Median follow-up time was 17.7 months. Median overall survival time was 19.2 months. Thirty-two patients (27%) developed brain metastasis. Non-brain metastases occurred in 51 patients (42%). No variables were statistically significantly associated with the risk of developing brain metastasis. Trends for higher risks of brain metastasis were observed with younger age (P = 0.09), and poor performance status (P = 0.07). Brain metastasis risk was highest during the first 10 months, progressively declining thereafter.	Stage III NSCLC patients treated with CRT have high risks of brain metastasis which persist during the first 10 months after diagnosis.

999,30539767,Schizophrenia research,Hippocampal volume and vasculature before and after exercise in treatment-resistant schizophrenia.,"Schizophrenia is associated with poor cognitive function and elevated cardiometabolic disease risk. These health concerns may exacerbate neurocognitive dysfunction associated with hippocampal abnormalities, particularly hippocampal volume reductions. Regular exercise is thought to improve symptom severity, reduce depression, and improve cognition in schizophrenia, and may trigger exercise-mediated hippocampal growth. The potential for the benefits of exercise for treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has not been clearly assessed. This study aims to assess the effect of exercise on hippocampal plasticity and clinical outcomes in chronic schizophrenia.	Seventeen DSM-IV criteria schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder patients completed a customized moderate intensity 12-week aerobic or weight-bearing exercise program. Adherence rates were 83% ± 9.4%) with 70% of participants completing the entire exercise program. Concomitant neuroimaging, clinical and cognitive assessments were obtained at baseline and 12-weeks.	At follow-up, symptom severity scores (t(16) = -16.8, p. ≤ 0.0001) and social functioning (t(16) = 4.4, p. = 0.0004) improved. A trend for improved depression scores (t(16) = -2.0, p. = 0.06) with no change in anxiety, or extrapyramidal symptoms were seen.

Change in hippocampal volume and vascular volume was not significantly correlated with change in symptom severity or affect scores.	Adjunct exercise may accelerate symptom improvement in treatment-resistant psychosis patients. While the underlying mechanism remains unclear, these results indicate that chronic schizophrenia patients experience hippocampal plasticity in response to exercise.

1002,17244569,The International journal of psycho-analysis,"Thinking with, and about, patients too scared to think: can non-interpretive maneuvers stimulate reflective thought?","Patients incapable of higher-order (symbolic) thinking can often not tolerate evidence of the analyst's separate existence, particularly when that 'otherness' becomes evident in the process of the analyst's reflecting upon and interpreting how the patient experiences or represents the analyst. The patient's intolerance of the analyst's efforts to think (reflect upon and interpret) renders the usual psychoanalytic maneuvers employed to stimulate reflective thought ineffective with such patients. Such patients have to learn to tolerate multiple perspectives before they can allow the analyst, or themselves, to think in the other's presence. The author presents two clinical vignettes that illustrate how the analyst's efforts to think about the patient were experienced by the patient as both intolerably distancing and as rejecting of an aspect of the patient's subjective reality. Working psychoanalytically with such patients requires the analyst to forego the use of narrow interpretations that elucidate unconscious meanings and motives in favor of alternate technical maneuvers capable of facilitating the development of symbolic thinking and reflective thought (insightfulness). These maneuvers include a demonstration of the analyst's willingness and ability to withstand (rather than 'interpret away') how he is being psychically represented by the patient, without becoming destroyed by, or lost within, the patient's characterization of him. Beside modeling a tolerance of alternate perspectives of one's self, other non-interpretive maneuvers that help facilitate the development of self-reflective thought include: stimulating the patient's curiosity about the workings of his own mind by identifying incompletely understood behaviors or reactions worthy of greater psychological understanding, and insinuating doubt about the adequacy of the patient's explanations of such phenomena.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Phenol block was conducted in nine patients with cerebral infarction (13 blocking procedures) and three with spinal cord injuries (six blocking procedures) while keeping them in a lateral position with the operation side upside. The beginning of the femoral nerves and part of the lumbar artery were visualized by ultrasound in some patients. As a result of the improvement of hip flexor spasticity, the range of hip joint motion (determined by the Mundale technique, prone hip extension and Thomas test) improved shortly after blocking. When physical therapy was conducted after blocking, improvement of skin care management was observed in eight cases, ability to keep in a stable sitting position in nine, improvement of a standing posture in three, increases in the ability to walk in two and alleviation of pain in three.

Most CPT research to date has focused on pre- to post-treatment change in total PTSD symptoms; however, PTSD symptom criteria may not change equivalently over the course of treatment. For example, changes in re-experiencing symptoms have been shown to precede changes in other PTSD criteria during other PTSD treatments (i.e. virtual reality exposure therapy, venlafaxine ER). An improved understanding of the mechanism of change in PTSD symptoms during CPT may assist in optimizing treatment.	The purpose of this study was to identify the pattern and temporal precedence of change in PTSD symptom criteria during and after CPT using cross-lagged panel analyses.	Data from veterans (n = 32) enrolled in a randomized clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of CPT for MST-related PTSD were utilized for this secondary analysis. Using hierarchical linear modelling, each symptom criterion was entered as a predictor of subsequent change in the other PTSD symptom criteria.	All symptom criteria followed a logarithmic pattern of change. Hyperarousal symptoms were found to both predict and temporally precede change in avoidance symptoms, but not re-experiencing symptoms. Re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms did not predict change in other PTSD symptom criteria.	These findings provide initial support that targeting and reducing hyperarousal symptoms may be a key component of PTSD intervention with CPT. Additional research is needed to identify factors that predict change in PTSD-related re-experiencing symptoms.",cognitive processing therapy| hyperarousal| military sexual trauma| posttraumatic stress disorder| veterans,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Effective, affordable person-centered interventions are required to improve the lived experiences of individuals with dementia and their caregivers in various care settings. The present study examined the effects of a person-centered music listening intervention on mood, agitation and social engagement for individuals living with dementia. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was carried out with participants at five community-based adult day health centers (n = 51). Standardized instruments were used to measure mood and agitation, and in-person and video-recorded observations of participant behavior were used to analyze changes before, during and after the intervention across four domains: mood, agitation, connecting to music and engaging socially. Within-person differences were examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between-group differences were examined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Although standardized instruments did not yield statistically significant results, the behavioral observations showed a positive change in mood and a decrease in agitation. From pre- to post-intervention, there were statistically significant increases in joy, eye contact, eye movement, being engaged and talkativeness, and a decrease in sleeping and moving or dancing. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral observations show the positive impact a person-centered music listening intervention might have on individuals living with dementia and attending adult day health centers. This affordable intervention provides a useful tool for caregivers that might improve the day-to-day experience of individuals living with dementia.

In univariate analyses, a positive screen was associated with older age and fewer education years, lower 3MS exam score, greater baseline geriatric depression scale score, and greater frailty score. Lower 3MS score was the only variable that remained significant in the final model (adjusted odds ratio 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.95).	One in 12 women ≥60 years deemed eligible for discharge on the day of prolapse surgery screens positive for delirium. The 7-day POD incidence is comparable to other elective non-cardiac surgery cohorts. Given the increasing trend toward same day discharge after major prolapse surgery, more research is needed to determine the impact of universal delirium screening as part of discharge assessments.",Cognitive impairment| Older females| Pelvic organ prolapse| Perioperative neurocognitive disorders| Postoperative delirium| Surgical outcomes,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1012,30550449,The Journal of craniofacial surgery,Technique of Fractionated Transcatheter Arterial Embolization for Treating Large Arteriovenous Malformation in Brain Functional Area.,"At present, large cranial function area arteriovenous malformation (fAVM) is mainly treated by craniotomy with a high risk of operation and high disability. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of the neural intervention technology, fractionated transcatheter arterial embolization (fTAE) may be used to treat the fAVM instead of surgical treatment. However, its effectiveness for treating fAVM has never been explored. The authors hypothesized that fTAE can be effective in the treatment of fTAE.	A retrospective study was conducted in 229 cases of large fAVM in multicenter hospitals. Among them, 103 cases were performed fTAE and the other 126 cases were carried on minimally invasive craniotomy (MIC). Clinically relevant symptomatic improvement and complications were compared between 2 groups.	Complete resection rate of arteriovenous malformation in MIC group (100%) was significantly higher than that of complete embolization rate in fTAE group (77.7%) (P = 0.000). However, the incidence of postoperative complications includes decreased limb muscle strength (P = 0.001), sensory loss of extremities (P = 0.003), visual field defect (P = 0.025) that were lower in fTAE group and remission rate of headache (P = 0.012) but not epilepsy (P = 0.952) was higher in fTAE group compared with that in MIC group. After 1 year follow-up, the rebleeding rate in the fTAE treatment group was 4.85%, higher than that in MIC group (0%) (P = 0.000).	Fractionated transcatheter arterial embolization therapy is beneficial for reducing the postoperative complications and preoperative symptoms of fAVM, but not for recurrence rate.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1013,21046068,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,Experiences of acute mental health care in an ethnically diverse inner city: qualitative interview study.,"Ethnic inequalities in experiences of mental health care persist in the UK, although most evidence derives from in-patient settings. We aimed to explore service users' and carers' accounts of recent episodes of severe mental illness and of the care received in a multi-cultural inner city. We sought to examine factors impacting on these experiences, including whether and how users and carers felt that their experiences were mediated by ethnicity.	Forty service users and thirteen carers were recruited following an acute psychotic episode using typical case sampling. In-depth interviews explored illness and treatment experiences. Ethnicity was allowed to emerge in participants' narratives and was prompted if necessary.	Ethnicity was not perceived to impact significantly on therapeutic relationships, and nor were there ethnic differences in care pathways, or in the roles of families and friends. Ethnic diversity was commonplace among both service users and mental health professionals. This was tolerated in community settings if efforts were made to ensure high-quality care. Home Treatment was rated highly, irrespective of service users' ethnicity. In-patient care was equally unpopular and was the one setting where ethnicity appeared to mediate unsatisfactory care experiences. These findings highlight the risks of generalising from reports of (dis)satisfaction with care based predominantly on in-patient experiences.	Home treatment was popular but hard to deliver in deprived surroundings and placed a strain on carers. Interventions to enhance community treatments in deprived areas are needed, along with remedial interventions to improve therapeutic relationships in hospital settings.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The mean duration of drainage for this group was 20.7 days. Although two patients died before shunting was considered, no morbidity or mortality was observed to result from this technique. Seven patients required a shunt after stabilization of their medical problems. Two patients, followed for 24 and 40 months, have not required shunting procedures. External ventricular drainage via a subcutaneously tunneled catheter has been found to be a safe and reliable initial method of treating posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus in premature infants.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PED for treatment of wide necked small and medium intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: PREMIER is a prospective, multicenter, single arm trial. Patients were treated with the PED for unruptured wide necked aneurysms, measuring ≤12 mm along the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery, between July 2014 and November 2015. At 1 year post-procedure, the primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion (Raymond grade 1) without major parent vessel stenosis (≤50%) or retreatment, and the primary safety endpoint was major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were treated with PEDs (mean age 54.6±11.3 years, 87.9% (124/141) women). Mean aneurysm size was 5.0±1.92 mm, and 84.4% (119/141) measured <7 mm. PED placement was successful in 99.3% (140/141) of patients. Mean number of PEDs implanted per patient was 1.1±0.26; a single PED was used in 92.9% (131/141) of patients. At 1 year, 97.9% (138/141) of patients underwent follow-up angiography with 76.8% (106/138) of patients having met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint. The combined major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.1% (3/140). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of wide necked small/medium aneurysms with the PED results in high rates of complete occlusion without significant parent vessel stenosis and low rates of permanent neurologic complications.

1016,21156345,Epilepsy research,Epilepsy surgery in children under 3 years.,"Resective epilepsy surgery in early childhood has become an important treatment option for selected infants and children with epilepsy. We describe experience and clinical outcomes of children under 3 years undergoing epilepsy surgery at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH).	All children under 36 months of age who had resective surgery for the purpose of treating epilepsy within the GOSH epilepsy surgery programme were ascertained using a departmental database. Aetiology, post-operative seizure frequency, pre and post-operative cognitive function, long-term complications and re-operation rates were analysed by retrospective examination of clinical records.	Forty-two children were included in our cohort with a median age at surgery of 20 months (range 3-36 months). Surgical procedures comprised 25 functional hemispherectomies, two anatomical hemispherectomies, four multilobar resections, seven lobar resections and four focal resections. 7/42 (17%, 95% CI 8-31%) children underwent re-operation. 20/42 (48%, 95% CI 33-62%) children achieved seizure freedom. 18/42 (43%, 95% CI 29-58) demonstrated an improvement in seizure frequency and no children had an increase in seizure frequency. Post-operative complications included subsequent shunt procedure in 5/25 (20%, 95% CI 9-39%) children undergoing hemispherectomy. There were no mortalities. In 23 children pre- and post-operative DQ or IQ was determinable allowing longitudinal comparison. Five children had a decrease in DQ/IQ >15 and two children had an increase DQ/IQ >15.	Epilepsy surgery in children under 3 years of age offers suitable candidates a good chance of significantly improved seizure outcome which compares with rates in older cohorts.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

We evaluated the outcome of 44 children with malignant brain tumors treated with HDCx and tandem AuHCT at Children's Hospital Los Angeles between June 1999 and July 2012. Forty-four children with malignant brain tumors were studied. Twenty-one had medulloblastoma/primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor, eight atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), five high-grade glioma, four malignant germ cell tumor, three ependymoma and three choroid plexus carcinoma. Twenty-nine patients received three tandem transplants and 15 received two tandem transplants, respectively. The 5-year PFS and overall survivals (OS) for all patients were 46.3±8.2% and 51.7±8.5%, respectively. The PFS and OS for 27 newly diagnosed patients were 68.9±9.9% and 73.5±9.3%, respectively, compared with 17 transplanted at relapse 11.8±9.8% (P<0.001) and 15.1±12.3% (P=0.0231), respectively. The 5-year PFS and OS in 13 previously unirradiated patients were 74±13% and 74±13% versus 33.2±9.8% and 40.2±10.6% in 31 irradiated patients (P=0.11 and P=0.239), respectively.

1019,1396427,Epilepsia,Placebo-controlled pilot study of centromedian thalamic stimulation in treatment of intractable seizures,"Stimulation of centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei has been proposed as a treatment for seizures. We implanted programmable subcutaneous (s.c.) stimulators into CM bilaterally in 7 patients with intractable epilepsy to test feasibility and safety. Stimulation was on or off in 3-month blocks, with a 3-month washout period in a double-blind, cross-over protocol. Stimuli were delivered as 90-microseconds pulses at 65 pulses/s, 1 min of each 5 min for 2 h/day, with voltage set to half the sensory threshold. Stimulation was safe and well-tolerated, with a mean reduction of tonic-clonic seizure frequency of 30% with respect to baseline when stimulator was on versus a decrease of 8% when the stimulator was off. There was no improvement in total number of generalized seizures with stimulation, and treatment differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation at low intensity did not alter the EEG acutely, but high-intensity stimulation induced slow waves or 2-3 Hz spike-waves with ipsilateral frontal maximum. In an open-label follow-up segment with stimulator trains continuing for 24 h/day, 3 of 6 patients reported at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency. There were no side effects. This pilot project demonstrated the feasibility of controlled study of thalamic stimulation in epilepsy, but further study will be needed to demonstrate efficacy.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1020,26340346,PloS one,Intervention for Smokers through New Communication Technologies: What Perceptions Do Patients and Healthcare Professionals Have? A Qualitative Study.,"The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the health service is increasing. In spite of limitations, such as lack of time and experience, the deployment of ICTs in the healthcare system has advantages which include patient satisfaction with secure messaging, and time saving benefits and utility for patients and health professionals. ICTs may be helpful as either interventions on their own or as complementary tools to help patients stop smoking.	To gather opinions from both medical professionals and smokers about an email-based application that had been designed by our research group to help smoking cessation, and identify the advantages and disadvantages associated with interventions based on the utilization of ICTs for this purpose.	A qualitative, descriptive-interpretative study with a phenomenological perspective was performed to identify and interpret the discourses of the participating smokers and primary healthcare professionals. Data were obtained through two techniques: semi-structured individual interviews and discussion groups, which were recorded and later systematically and literally transcribed together with the interviewer's notes. Data were analyzed with the ATLAS TI 6.0 programme.	Seven individual interviews and four focal groups were conducted. The advantages of the application based on the email intervention designed by our research group were said to be the saving of time in consultations and ease of access for patients who found work timetables and following a programme for smoking cessation incompatible. The disadvantages were thought to be a lack of personal contact with the healthcare professional, and the possibility of cheating/ self-deception, and a greater probability of relapse on the part of the smokers.	Both patients and healthcare professionals viewed the email-based application to help patients stop smoking as a complementary aid to face-to-face consultations. Nevertheless, ICTs could not substitute personal contact in the smoking cessation programme.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Fifteen boys ranging between 5 and 15 years old consulted our clinics for nocturnal and diurnal enuresis which had not been improved by medication and behavioral therapy. Among them, voiding cystography revealed bulbar narrowing (Cobb's Collar) in 10 cases and vesico-ureteral reflux was found in four cases (seven ureters). Endoscopically, this lesion was recognized as a ring-form stenosis just distal to the urethral sphincter. It was incised with infantile urethrotome.	Vesico-ureteral reflux was resolved in four ureters and improved in one. In all cases, daytime enuresis resolved dramatically and night enuresis became controllable.

Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a promising alternative convulsive treatment with a safer cognitive profile. Although there is emerging evidence for the efficacy of MST for TRD as an acute treatment, there are no published studies of continuation MST for the prevention of relapse. Methods: Patients with TRD with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who met response criteria after acute MST were offered continuation MST in a prospective, open-label trial between February 2012 and June 2019. They received 12 continuation MST sessions with decreasing frequency over the course of 6 months, with additional booster sessions if their depression symptoms started to worsen. The primary outcome was relapse of depression or psychiatric hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included relapse of suicidal ideation and neurocognitive outcomes. Results: Thirty participants completing at least one assessment during continuation MST were included in the analysis; 10 (33.3%) relapsed, with no significant differences in survival distributions between unipolar and bipolar groups (χ(2) = 0.3, P = .58). Mean (SD) survival time was 18.6 (1.6) weeks. All 17 participants who achieved resolution of baseline suicidality after acute MST remained free of suicidality during the continuation phase. Except for improvement in verbal fluency, neurocognitive test scores did not change during continuation MST. Conclusions: During 6 months of continuation MST, two-thirds of participants sustained improvements in depressive symptoms without any adverse cognitive effects. Future studies of continuation MST are warranted, particularly in comparison to ECT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01596608.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Due to the complexities of cognition–emotion interactions during ongoing CBT, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, which hinders treatment optimization.	We created a laboratory analogue by combining reappraisal, a key ingredient of cognitive restructuring, with Pavlovian conditioning, a key ingredient in behavioral treatments. The novel differential Pavlovian acquisition and extinction task featured social stimuli as conditioned and unconditioned stimuli under unregulated and reappraisal instructions.	Findings indicated that reappraising the conditioned stimuli attenuated acquisition (Study 1) and facilitated extinction (Study 2) of conditioned negative valence. In Study 3, highly socially anxious individuals showed deficient extinction learning relative to low socially anxious individuals but compensated for this by using reappraisal.	Diagnostic status of participants was not assessed in structured clinical interviews.

This observational study assessed the impact of SfW on subjective well-being, weight and waist circumference (WC).	Data was collected at 49 psychiatric clinics. Where the SfW program was offered patients could enter the intervention group; where not, the control group. Subjective well-being was measured by the Subjective Well-being under Neuroleptics scale (SWN), at baseline, at the end of SfW participation, and at a follow-up 6 months after baseline. Demographic, disease and treatment data was also collected.	314 patients enrolled in the SfW group, 59 in the control group. 54% of the patients had schizophrenia, 67% received atypical antipsychotics, 56% were female.

This study must use an objective method to reliably estimate hemodynamic brain ischemia. We devised a method of objectively classifying the severity of hemodynamic ischemia using quantitatively analytical and display software, stereotactic extraction estimation for stereotactic brain coordinates and three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP). We analyzed data from 16 patients registered in the JET study. Our method offers quantitative information and 3-dimensional displays of the CBF at rest and after Diamox challenge, vascular reserve and the severity of the hemodynamic brain ischemia. We compared the maximal projection counts with ROI data from tomographic images in the anterior commissure-posterior commissure plane. The maximal counts data correlated closely with the ROI data of rest and with Diamox SPECT images (both p < 0.0001). The slopes of the linear regression line were 1.15 and 1.12, respectively. The results of this study indicated that our method could simply and objectively evaluate the severity of impaired brain circulation.

Disrupted sleep is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) particularly in the inpatient rehabilitation setting where it may affect participation in therapy and outcomes. Treatment of sleep disruption in this setting is varied and largely unexamined. Objective. To study the feasibility of instituting a sleep hygiene intervention on a rehabilitation unit. Methods. Twenty-two individuals admitted to a brain injury unit were enrolled and allocated, using minimization, to either a sleep hygiene protocol (SHP) or standard of care (SOC). All participants wore actigraphs, underwent serial cognitive testing, and had light monitors placed in their hospital rooms for 4 weeks. Additionally, participants in the SHP received 30 minutes of blue-light therapy each morning, had restricted caffeine intake after noon, and were limited to 30-minute naps during the day. SHP participants had their lights out time set according to preinjury sleep time preference. Both groups were treated with the same restricted formulary of centrally acting medications. Results. Of 258 patients screened, 27 met all study inclusion criteria of whom 22 were enrolled. Nine participants in each group who had at least 21 days of treatment were retained for analysis. The protocol was rated favorably by participants, families, and staff. Actigraph sleep metrics improved in both groups during the 4-week intervention; however, only in the SHP was the change significant. Conclusions. Sleep hygiene is a feasible, nonpharmacologic intervention to treat disrupted sleep in a TBI inpatient rehabilitation setting. A larger study is warranted to examine treatment efficacy.

1032,8361572,No shinkei geka. Neurological surgery,[Two cases of metastatic brain tumor treated by interstitial brachytherapy].,"The prognosis of patients with metastatic brain tumor is very poor. Median survival of these patients has ranged from 1 month with no therapy, to 2 months with steroid, and from 3 to 6 months with brain radiation therapy of the whole brain. A more recent study comparing radiation therapy alone with surgery plus radiation, has shown good results in the combined surgery and radiation therapy group. But surgical excision is usually limited to patients with a surgically accessible solitary metastasis. And therapeutic options are limited once the tumor recurs locally after whole brain irradiation. Interstitial irradiation allows the delivery of a high dose of localized irradiation in the area of tumor recurrence with minimal risk of radiation damage to the surrounding brain tissue. But brachytherapy for brain metastasis has been performed in few cases. We reported two patients with unresectable metastatic brain tumors who were successfully treated with iridium-192 interstitial brachytherapy, and we discuss the strategy of the treatment. Case 1: A 78 year-old-man underwent a total gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Five months after surgery, he developed right hemiparesis. CT scan revealed a left occipital tumor with massive brain edema and a tiny nodule of tumor in the left thalamic region. The primary site was well-controlled and no systemic disease was seen during subsequent whole body examination. The occipital lesion was surgically excised and he received a postoperative radiation therapy of 50 Gy to the whole brain. The thalamic tumor had not responded to the irradiation and the size of tumor rapidly increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Cognitive function (Severe Impairment Battery), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia; CSDD), BPSD (Neuropsychiatric Inventory; NPI) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory; CMAI) were assessed at baseline and after each period. Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) for emotional status, Agitated Behavior Mapping Instrument (ABMI) and a checklist for motor activity were completed across the study periods, both during intervention sessions and after three hours. RESULTS: Cognition and NPI were unchanged across the study. Declines in the CMAI and CSDD scores after AAA were not significant, while the NPI anxiety item score decreased in comparison with CA (CA 3.1±2.3, AAA 1.5±2.7, p = 0.04). OERS ""sadness"" decreased (p = 0.002), while ""pleasure"" (p = 0.016) and ""general alertness"" (p = 0.003) increased during AAA compared with CA sessions, and observed sadness remained lower after three hours (p = 0.002). Motor activity increased significantly during AAA. CONCLUSION: In this sample of severe AD patients in ADCC, AAA was associated with a decrease in anxiety and sadness and an increase in positive emotions and motor activity in comparison with a control activity.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1034,9630769,Folia medica,Traumatic intracerebral hematomas--diagnostic and therapeutic problem.,A retrospective analysis was performed of 79 patients with hematomas treated surgically or conservatively. The surgical modality was most often opted for in the following cases: patients with hematomas exceeding 4 cm in diameter; patients with hematomas causing a pronounced dislocation of cerebral structures; patients with multiple hematomas that can be accessed through a bone flap. Hematomas smaller than 4 cm in diameter as well as those located in several brain regions were found to tend easily to resorption at the control computer tomography due to which we preferred treating them using conservative therapeutic methods. This therapeutic approach to the patients with hematomas is supported by the statistical analysis. Comparison of the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors shows that the former predominated in cases of hematomas located in the frontal lobe; the latter are predominant when the hematomas are located in the temporal lobe of the brain. There was no difference between the groups of surgically and conservatively treated patients with respect to the outcome of the disease if it is improvement or death. In the group of patients who underwent conservative treatment there was a predominance of those patients that showed no improvement of the initial state. The following conclusions can be made: 1. Surgical treatment is most often administered to patients with hematomas greater than 4 cm in diameter and hematomas causing dislocation of the cerebral structures. 2. The patients at highest risk for adverse outcome are those with temporal location of the hematoma.,,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1035,30304477,The Gerontologist,Translating an Evidence-based Multicomponent Intervention for Older Adults With Dementia and Caregivers,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Effective community-based programs to maintain health and well-being of adults with dementia are needed. This article describes the translation, implementation, and effectiveness of a multicomponent exercise plus behavioral/psychosocial intervention (Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease-NorthWest [RDAD-NW]) conducted by staff in regional Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Staggered multiple baseline design was used; 10 AAAs, 20 case managers, and 255 community-residing persons with dementia (PWDs), and family caregivers were enrolled. RDAD-NW was conducted in-home over 6 weeks with aerobic/endurance, strength, and balance/flexibility exercises, dementia education, training to increase pleasant events, and activator-behavior-consequence problem-solving approach. Outcomes included case manager treatment fidelity, and caregiver/PWD physical activity, restricted activity days, physical functioning, quality of life, and affect. RESULTS: RDAD-NW was successfully translated and implemented by AAA agency staff through their usual service provision mechanisms. Staff responded positively and delivered the program with a high degree of fidelity. Caregiver/PWD dyads also responded favorably engaging in both exercise and behavioral/psychosocial portions of the program. A total of 207 dyads (81%) completed the intervention and 140 (55%) completed the 13-month follow-up. PWD physical activity increased significantly pre- to posttreatment (p < .001, ES = .54), and 13 months (p < .01, ES = .21). Quality of life of PWD increased significantly pre- to posttreatment (p < .001, ES = .29); caregiver depression improved pre- to posttreatment (p = .01, ES = -.18). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: RDAD-NW was successfully translated and implemented by AAA case managers and resulted in increased physical activity and improved behavioral and emotional outcomes of caregiver/PWDs. Results support continued dissemination and implementation of RDAD-NW.

1036,18338212,Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,Buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction after internal iliac artery embolization in patients prior to endovascular aortic aneurysm repair.,"Coil embolization of the internal iliac artery (IIA) is used to extend the application of endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) in cases of challenging iliac anatomy. Pelvic ischemia is a complication of the technique, but reports vary as to the rate and severity. This study reports our experience with IIA embolization and compares the results to those of other published series. The vascular unit database of the Leicester Royal Infirmary was used to identify patients who had undergone IIA coil embolization prior to EVAR. Data were collected from hospital case notes and by telephone interviews. Thirty-eight patients were identified; 29 of these were contactable by telephone. A literature search was performed for other studies of IIA embolization and the results were pooled. In this series buttock claudication occurred in 55% (16 of 29 patients) overall: in 52% of unilateral embolizations (11 of 21) and 63% of bilateral embolizations (5 of 8). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 46% (6 of 13 patients) overall: in 38% of unilateral embolizations (3 of 8) and 60% of bilateral embolizations (3 of 5). The literature review identified 18 relevant studies. The results were pooled with our results, to give 634 patients in total. Buttock claudication occurred in 28% overall (178 of 634 patients): in 31% of unilateral embolizations (99 of 322) and 35% of bilateral embolizations (34 of 98) (p = 0.46, Fisher's exact test). New erectile dysfunction occurred in 17% overall (27 of 159 patients): in 17% of unilateral embolizations (16 of 97) and 24% of bilateral embolizations (9 of 38) (p = 0.33). We conclude that buttock claudication and erectile dysfunction are frequent complications of IIA embolization and patients should be counseled accordingly.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1037,3081622,Journal of hepatology,Controlled hyperventilation in the prevention of cerebral oedema in fulminant hepatic failure.,"Raised intracranial pressure due to cerebral oedema is a major cause of death in fulminant hepatic failure and in the present study we have carried out a controlled clinical trial of continuous hyperventilation in the prevention of this complication. Twenty patients were electively hyperventilated to maintain PaCO2 between 3.5 and 5 kPa. In the other 35 patients mechanical ventilation was instituted only if severe hypoxia or hypercapnia occurred. Cerebral oedema, diagnosed clinically or by a rise in intracranial pressure to greater than 30 mm Hg, occurred in 85% of hyperventilated patients and in 86% of those not so treated. Although there was no significant reduction in the number of episodes of cerebral oedema in the hyperventilated patients (4.8 episodes/24 h) as compared with the controls (5.3 episodes/24 h), hyperventilation did appear to delay the onset of coning but on the basis of these results could not be recommended to be used routinely as a prophylactic measure in the prevention of cerebral oedema in this condition.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
1038,16413666,European urology,Baseline potency in candidates for bilateral nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy.,"To assess the baseline erectile function (EF) of patients with clinically localized prostate cancer (pCa), who are candidates for a bilateral nerve-sparing radical retropubic prostatectomy (BNSRRP) to (a) objectively rate the preoperative self-reported subjective patient's EF and (b) investigate possible correlations between preoperative EF and demographic data and comorbidities.	Two-hundred-thirty-four patients, who verbally self-reported they were preoperatively fully potent and strongly motivated to maintain postoperative EF, underwent a BNSRRP. A comprehensive medical and sexual history was obtained on hospital admission the day prior to surgery. Subjectively reported potency rate was compared with the scores of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF).	The EF domain of the IIEF showed a baseline normal EF in only 43% of the subjects. In contrast, 13% had a mild erectile dysfunction (ED), 8% had a mild to moderate ED, 8% complained of a moderate ED, and as many as 28% reported severe EF impairment. Interestingly, 38% of the patients with severe ED did not attempt any intercourse during the last 4 weeks prior to surgery.	A significant proportion of patients with clinically localized pCa and self-reported total potency already had suffered from ED preoperatively. Incorrect timing of questionnaires administration, the potential influence of preoperative patient's psychological distress, and the implication of the patient's partner's psychological and sexual health may be contributing factors to the contradictory finding. The preoperative use of validated questionnaire may help to identify patients who can actually expect to regain potency following a BNSRRP.",,Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A total of 16 amblyopes of 9 years or older (range, 9.0-14.5 years; mean, 10.5 years) with a difference in visual acuity of over two lines between the eyes alter 4 weeks of first full-time spectacle wear were included. None of the children had undergone a previous ocular examination, had ever worn spectacles, received occlusion therapy, or had strabismus surgery. Initial worst visual acuity after 4 weeks of full-time spectacle wear was 20/100 in three patients, between 20/80 and 20/40 in 11 patients, and 20/30 in two patients. Full-time occlusion was performed in 14 patients and part-time occlusion in two patients.	The final visual acuity of 15 out of 16 patients (94%) improved at least two lines. The final visual acuities ranged from 20/30 to 20/20 in 14 patients, 20/40 in one patient, and 20/50 in one remaining patient who began amblyopia therapy at 14.5 years of age, with the poorest compliance among the patients.

1040,31434803,JCI insight,Transcription factor EB overexpression prevents neurodegeneration in experimental synucleinopathies.,"The synucleinopathies Parkinson's disease (PD) and Multiple system atrophy (MSA) - characterized by α-synuclein intracytoplasmic inclusions into, respectively, neurons and oligodendrocytes - are associated with impairment of the autophagy-lysosomal pathways (ALP). Increased expression of the master regulator of ALP, transcription factor EB (TFEB), is hypothesized to promote the clearance of WT α-synuclein and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Here, we explore the efficacy of targeted TFEB overexpression either in neurons or oligodendrocytes to reduce the pathological burden of α-synuclein in a PD rat model and a MSA mouse model. While TFEB neuronal expression was sufficient to prevent neurodegeneration in the PD model, we show that only TFEB oligodendroglial overexpression leads to neuroprotective effects in the MSA model. These beneficial effects were associated with a decreased accumulation of α-synuclein into oligodendrocytes through recovery of the ALP machinery. Our study demonstrates that the cell type where α-synuclein aggregates dictates the target of TFEB overexpression in order to be protective, paving the way for adapted therapies.",Autophagy| Gene therapy| Neuroscience| Parkinson’s disease| Therapeutics,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Here we investigated whether function-blocking antibodies against the nerve-fiber growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A applied to rats with severe SCI could prevent development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction. Bladder function of rats with SCI was repeatedly assessed by urodynamic examination in fully awake animals. Four weeks after SCI, detrusor sphincter dyssynergia had developed in all untreated or control antibody-infused animals. In contrast, 2 weeks of intrathecal anti-Nogo-A antibody treatment led to significantly reduced aberrant maximum detrusor pressure during voiding and a reduction of the abnormal EMG high-frequency activity in the external urethral sphincter. Anatomically, we found higher densities of fibers originating from the pontine micturition center in the lumbosacral gray matter in the anti-Nogo-A antibody-treated animals, as well as a reduced number of inhibitory interneurons in lamina X. These results suggest that anti-Nogo-A therapy could also have positive effects on bladder function clinically.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT After spinal cord injury, loss of bladder control is common. Detrusor sphincter dyssynergia is a potentially life-threatening consequence. Currently, only symptomatic treatment options are available. First causal treatment options are urgently needed in humans. In this work, we show that function-blocking antibodies against the nerve-fiber growth inhibitory protein Nogo-A applied to rats with severe spinal cord injury could prevent development of neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction, in particular detrusor sphincter dyssynergia. Anti-Nogo-A therapy has entered phase II clinical trial in humans and might therefore soon be the first causal treatment option for neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction.",CRF| Nogo-A| neuro-urology| neurogenic lower urinary tract dysfunction| spinal cord injury| urodynamics,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1042,7512580,Journal of neuroimmunology,Transforming growth factor-beta 1 inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha/lymphotoxin production and adoptive transfer of disease by effector cells of autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"We previously reported that the CD4+ suppressor cells (Ts) that regulate recovery of Lewis rats from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) produce transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta). We also reported that TGF-beta downregulates interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), but not interleukin-2 (IL-2) production, by the CD4+ effector T cells (Te) that mediate EAE. We now report that TGF-beta also inhibits the production of tumor necrosis factor/lymphotoxin (TNF/LT) by EAE effector cells. When activated in vitro with myelin basic protein (MBP), Te produced TNF/LT, as measured using a WEHI 164 cytotoxicity assay. The specificity of cytokine action was demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to TNF/LT. When added to the Te+MBP cultures, TGF-beta inhibited TNF/LT production in a dose-dependent fashion. Moreover, neutralizing anti-TGF-beta antibodies augmented TNF/LT production in the Te+MBP cultures. We also confirm that TGF-beta inhibits adoptive transfer of EAE. In contrast, murine IL-10 only partially inhibited TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by Te. We conclude that TGF-beta production by Ts plays a major role in recovery from EAE in the Lewis rat by inhibiting TNF/LT and IFN-gamma production by the effector cells that mediate EAE.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1043,15319703,Clinical neuropharmacology,Levetiracetam Interferes With the L-dopa priming process in MPTP-lesioned drug-naive marmosets.,"Levetiracetam (LEV; Keppra, UCB Pharma) has been shown to reduce established l-3,4 dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa)-induced dyskinesia. This study investigated whether LEV can modify induction of dyskinesia by l-dopa or the process of priming.	Drug-naive MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) -lesioned marmosets were treated for 21 days with l-dopa/LEV or l-dopa alone. Subsequently, the animals were left untreated for 1 week and then both groups were challenged with a single dose of l-dopa alone on day 29. Behavior was assessed by automated activity counts and by post hoc analysis of videotapes using validated rating scales.	LEV had no significant effect on the appearance of dyskinesia when administered de novo in combination with l-dopa. However, after a week of drug holiday, the 2 groups exhibited a different response to an acute l-dopa challenge. Thus, animals previously treated with l-dopa alone exhibited a similar level of dyskinesia to that seen on day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study. However, animals previously treated with l-dopa/LEV demonstrated significantly reduced dyskinesia compared with day 21 of the repeated treatment phase of the study.	LEV does not modify the onset of dyskinesia following de novo treatment with l-dopa. However, concomitant treatment with l-dopa/LEV reduces the level of dyskinesia induced by l-dopa following a drug holiday. Thus, prior treatment with LEV appears to modify the mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

1046,33779331,Human & experimental toxicology,Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells-derived exosomes reduce apoptosis and inflammatory response during spinal cord injury by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most common destructive injuries, which may lead to permanent neurological dysfunction. Currently, transplantation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) in experimental models of SCI shows promise as effective therapies. BMSCs secrete various factors that can regulate the microenvironment, which is called paracrine effect. Among these paracrine substances, exosomes are considered to be the most valuable therapeutic factors. Our study found that BMSCs-derived exosomes therapy attenuated cell apoptosis and inflammation response in the injured spinal cord tissues. In in vitro studies, BMSCs-derived exosomes significantly inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced PC12 cell apoptosis, reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and IL (interleukin)-1β and promoted the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors including IL-10 and IL-4. Moreover, we found that LPS-induced protein expression of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and nuclear transcription factor-κB (NF-κB) was significantly downregulated after treatment with BMSCs-derived exosomes. In in vivo studies, we found that hindlimb motor function was significantly improved in SCI rats with systemic administration of BMSCs-derived exosomes. We also observed that the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and pro-inflammatory factors was significantly decreased, while the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins and anti-inflammatory factors were upregulated in SCI rats after exosome treatment. In conclusion, BMSCs-derived exosomes can inhibit apoptosis and inflammation response induced by injury and promote motor function recovery by inhibiting the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway, which suggests that BMSCs-derived exosomes are expected to become a new therapeutic strategy for SCI.",Spinal cord injury| bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells| exosomes| inflammatory response| the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group, model group, TAE (110 mg/kg) group, TPNS (115 mg/kg) group, TAE-TPNS combination group and Edaravone (4 mg/kg) group, treated for 4 days, then, cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury was established by bilateral common carotid artery (CCA) ligation for 20 min followed by reperfusion for 1 and 24 h.	TPNS could increase adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level, TAE and TAE-TPNS combination increased ATP, adenosine diphosphate (ADP) contents and Na[+]-K[+]-ATPase activity, and the effects of TAE-TPNS combination were stronger than those of TAE or TPNS alone after reperfusion for 1 h. After reperfusion for 24 h, TAE, TPNS and TAE-TPNS combination significantly increased neurocyte survival rate and decreased the apoptosis rate as well as down-regulated the expression of phosphorylated c-June N-terminal kinase1/2 (p-JNK1/2), cytochrome C (Cyt C), cysteine aspartic acid-specific protease (Caspase)-9 and Caspase-3. Furthermore, the effects in TAE-TPNS combination were better than those in TAE or TPNS alone.	The combination of TAE 110 mg/kg and TPNS 115 mg/kg could strengthen protective effects on cerebral ischemia injury, the mechanism underlying might be related to improving jointly the early energy metabolism, and relieving the delayed apoptosis via inhibiting the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway of JNK signal transduction.",C-Jun N-terminal kinase signal transduction| Chinese medicine| cerebral ischemia-reperfusion| combination| energy metabolism| mitochondrial apoptosis pathway| total Astragalus extract| total Panax notoginseng saponins,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1048,20801087,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Antiepileptic action of exogenous dehydroepiandrosterone in iron-induced epilepsy in rat brain.,"In the study described here, the antiepileptic effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) treatment on iron-induced focal epileptiform activity in the rat brain was investigated. DHEA is a neuroactive corticosteroid hormone synthesized both in the adrenal cortex and in the brain. Its antioxidant properties are well known. As oxidative stress seems to play a major role in epileptogenesis in the iron-induced model of posttraumatic epilepsy, it was of interest to examine whether DHEA would exert antiepileptic activity. DHEA at a dose of 30 mg/kg/day administered intraperitoneally for 7, 14, and 21 days to iron-induced epileptic rats prevented epileptiform electrophysiological activity. Morris water maze and open-field tests on iron-induced epileptic rats revealed that DHEA also prevented behavioral alterations related to epileptiform activity. Thus, DHEA attenuated the cognitive defects produced by epileptic activity. Moreover, alterations in epileptogenesis-related biochemical parameters-lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (sodium pump) activity--were also countered by DHEA.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Lewy pathology mainly consists of abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein, which play a pivotal role in PD pathophysiology. However, the complexity of PD leads to clinical challenges, and there are still no treatments to halt or slow the neurodegenerative process. Resveratrol (RV) is a natural polyphenol compound with multiple biological activities, which has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects on several neurological diseases. Here we first provided evidence that RV treatment alleviated motor and cognitive deficits in the A53T α-synuclein mouse model of PD in a dose-dependent manner. The beneficial effects of RV against PD resulted from inhibiting α-synuclein aggregation and cytotoxicity, lowering the levels of total α-synuclein and oligomers, reducing neuroinflammation and oxidative stress. These findings suggest that RV has promising therapeutic potential for PD and other synucleinopathies.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The ginsenoside compound K (CK) has been reported to ameliorate diabetes mellitus and confer protection to the central nervous system. In this study, we investigated whether CK could improve memory impairment and cognitive dysfunction in diabetic db/db mice. Firstly, we found that CK treatments significantly improved behavioral impairment and cognitive dysfunction based on Morris water maze, Y-maze, and fear conditioning tests. Besides, CK decreased the fasting glucose level, increased lipid metabolism, and ameliorated glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and dyslipidemia in diabetic db/db mice. In addition, CK treatments alleviated oxidative stress and inhibited the inflammatory response in hippocampal tissue. Further investigations showed that CK treatments inhibited the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway, as evidenced by the declined expression of TXNIP, NLRP3 inflammasomes, ASC, cleaved caspase-1, and mature IL-1β in hippocampal tissues. Moreover, CK treatments alleviated ER stress via down-regulating the level of BiP, CHOP, p-PERK, p-IRE1α and ATF6 in the hippocampus of db/db mice. These results suggest that CK improves memory and cognitive dysfunction, possibly by ameliorating glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and dyslipidemia, suppressing oxidative stress and inflammatory response and modulating the NLRP3 inflammasome pathway and ER stress.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

It has been shown to produce medicinal effects against hyperactivity, agitation and mania, as well as schizophrenia. Long-term usage of haloperidol raises the risk of acquiring a neurological condition like Parkinson's disease. Haloperidol causes drug-induced Parkinsonism (DIP) by blocking central dopamine receptors and causing extrapyramidal symptoms during long-term treatment. Quercetin has been shown to reduce the loss of striatal neurons, which may enhance motor capabilities and protect against agents that cause the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). As a result, present study intended to evaluate the efficacy of quercetin on haloperidol-related motor abnormalities. To develop behavioral impairments, rats (n=24) randomly divided to control and haloperidol group for four weeks. The animals were split into four groups after four weeks: Control, quercetin, haloperidol and haloperidol + quercetin. Animals were administered haloperidol i.p injections of 5mg/kg and quercetin (100mg/kg) orally for 21 days. The treatment of haloperidol-treated rats with quercetin was successful in reversing the haloperidol alterations. It decreased animal food intake and alleviated anxiogenic behavior.

Wistar rats were subjected to BCCAo procedure under anaesthesia to induce VaD. The rats were subjected to Morris water maze (MWM) test (6th day onwards post-surgery). MWM test was employed to assess learning and memory of the animals whereby escape latency time, time spent in target quadrant and Path length (distance travelled) taken as important parameters. Serum nitrite level; Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels; Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity; brain Myeloperoxidase activity (MPO) and neutrophil count were estimated as per standard procedures. BCCAo in rats produced a significant vascular endothelial dysfunction, as reflected by decrease in serum nitrite levels. Further, these animals showed poor performance on MWM, depicting impairment of learning and memory. There was a significant rise in brain oxidative stress level as indicated by increase in TBARS and decrease in GSH levels. An increase in brain AChE activity was also observed. Moreover, these rats also exhibited an increase in MPO activity and neutrophil infiltration in brain (as marker of inflammation). Treatment of Carnosine (200 and 400 mg/kg, i.p.)/Donepezil (0.3 mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated BCCAo-induced memory deficits; endothelial dysfunction; biochemical and histopathological changes. It is concluded that Carnosine has shown efficacy in rat model of BCCAo-induced VaD and can be considered as an important therapeutic agent for the treatment of VaD.",bilateral common carotid artery occlusion| carnosine| cognitive impairment| histamine| oxidative stress| vascular dementia,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1054,26827641,Neurobiology of aging,Dl-3-n-butylphthalide-induced upregulation of antioxidant defense is involved in the enhancement of cross talk between CREB and Nrf2 in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model,"Synapse impairment in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain is an early event leading to cognitive dysfunction. Most oxidative stress localizes to the synapse, and synapse loss is the basis of cognitive decline in AD. Dl-3-n-butylphthalide (Dl-NBP), a small molecule compound has been shown to ameliorate oxidative stress. We evaluated the effects of a 5-month oral delivery with Dl-NBP on oxidative stress and cognitive function in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Dl-NBP treatment reduced oxidative stress in the APP/PS1 mouse brain and alleviated learning and memory deficits. Dl-NBP supplementation meliorated synaptic plasticity, diminished soluble amyloid beta and amyloid beta oligomer in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. Dl-NBP administration caused an increase of cyclic adenosine monophosphate-response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP)-associated Ser133-phosphorylated CREB (p-CREB) protein. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that Dl-NBP increased the recruitment of CBP to the promoters of best-characterized genes downstream of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) quinone oxidoreductase 1, and γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase modifier subunit. We demonstrate that the Dl-NBP-triggered upregulation of antioxidant defenses is involved in the enhancement of cross talk between CREB and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 via CBP. Our results suggest that Dl-NBP may be a useful agent for the treatment of AD.",Alzheimer's disease| CREB| Cognitive dysfunction| Dl-NBP| Nrf2| Oxidative stress,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1055,3119161,Brain research bulletin,Bidirectional effects of beta-carbolines in reflex epilepsy.,"Derivatives of ethyl-beta-carboline-3-carboxylate, ZK 91296, ZK 93423 and ZK 95962 have potent anticonvulsant activity against sound-induced seizures in audiogenic DBA/2 mice and against photically-induced seizures in the baboon, Papio papio. The convulsant beta-carbolines, DMCM and beta-CCM, have proconvulsant and convulsant activity in the same animal models. DMCM and beta-CCM are similar in potency as convulsants in DBA/2 mice (ED50 value for DMCM: 1.3 mg/kg; ED50 value for beta-CCM; 0.8 mg/kg), but differ with respect to their profiles for protection by anticonvulsant drugs. The anticonvulsant potencies of diazepam and clobazam are similar against both types of beta-carboline-induced seizures, whereas quazepam protects better against beta-CCM seizures (4 fold elevation in ED50 value at 1 mg/kg quazepam IP) than against DMCM seizures (1.7 fold elevation in ED50 value), supporting a preferential action of beta-CCM on BZ1 receptors. Valproate (400 mg/kg) and gamma-vinyl-GABA (1.5 g/kg) protect better against beta-CCM seizures (9.5 and 5.9 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively) than against DMCM seizures (1.8 and 2.7 fold elevations in ED50 values respectively). The excitatory amino acid antagonist, 2-amino-7-phosphonoheptanoic acid, has significant anticonvulsant activity against DMCM seizures. The elevated regional GABA levels in brains of DBA/2 mice observed during beta-CCM seizures are eliminated by the pretreatment with Ro 15-1788, which also blocks the seizure activity.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1056,9130303,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Correlation between hippocampal neuronal damage and spatial learning deficit due to global ischemia.,"Global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the CA1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum. This ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze. The results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clear-cut. It has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage. The present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means. Global cerebral ischemia was induced in male Wistar rats by four-vessel occlusion for 20 min. Ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive non-NMDA receptor antagonist GYKI 52466 (30 mg/kg), the radical scavenger LY 231617 (20 mg/kg), the inhibitor of protein kinase C staurosporine (0.1 mg/kg), or solvent. Treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia. In addition, LY 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemia-induced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial. Staurosporine had no influence on the ischemia-induced behavioural changes. Histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats. However, treatment with GYKI 52466 or LY 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage. Correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). No correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.24, p > 0.1). No correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials (r = 0.28. p > 0.1) or quadrant time of the probe trial (r = -0.08, p > 0.6). It is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1057,25971300,Journal of the National Cancer Institute,FGL2 as a Multimodality Regulator of Tumor-Mediated Immune Suppression and Therapeutic Target in Gliomas.,"Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (FGL2) may promote glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cancer development by inducing multiple immune-suppression mechanisms.	The biological significance of FGL2 expression was assessed using the The Cancer Genome Atlast (TCGA) glioma database and tumor lysates analysis. The therapeutic effects of an anti-Fgl2 antibody and the role of immune suppression regulation by Fgl2 were determined in immune-competent, NOD-scid IL2Rgammanull (NSG), and FcɣRIIB-/- mice (n = 3-18 per group). Data were analyzed with two-way analysis of variance, log-rank survival analysis, and Pearson correlation. All statistical tests were two-sided.	In low-grade gliomas, 72.5% of patients maintained two copies of the FGL2 gene, whereas 83.8% of GBM patients had gene amplification or copy gain. Patients with high levels of FGL2 mRNA in glioma tissues had a lower overall survival (P = .009). Protein levels of FGL2 in GBM lysates were higher relative to low-grade glioma lysates (11.48±5.75ng/mg vs 3.96±1.01ng/mg, P = .003). In GL261 mice treated with an anti-FGL2 antibody, median survival was 27 days compared with only 17 days for mice treated with an isotype control antibody (P = .01). The anti-FGL2 antibody treatment reduced CD39(+) Tregs, M2 macrophages, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). FGL2-induced increases in M2, CD39, and PD-1 were ablated in FcɣRIIB-/- mice.	FGL2 augments glioma immunosuppression by increasing the expression levels of PD-1 and CD39, expanding the frequency of tumor-supportive M2 macrophages via the FcγRIIB pathway, and enhancing the number of MDSCs and CD39(+) regulatory T cells. Collectively, these results show that FGL2 functions as a key immune-suppressive modulator and has potential as an immunotherapeutic target for treating GBM.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1058,32317025,Alzheimer's research & therapy,"A selective p38α/β MAPK inhibitor alleviates neuropathology and cognitive impairment, and modulates microglia function in 5XFAD mouse","BACKGROUND: Chronic neuroinflammation, aggressive amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition, neuronal cell loss, and cognitive impairment are pathological presentations of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, resolution of neuroinflammation and inhibition of Aβ-driven pathology have been suggested to be important strategies for AD therapy. Previous efforts to prevent AD progression have identified p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) as a promising target for AD therapy. Recent studies showed pharmacological inhibition of p38α MAPK improved memory impairment in AD mouse models. METHODS: In this study, we used an AD mouse model, 5XFAD, to explore the therapeutic potential of NJK14047 which is a novel, selective p38α/β MAPK inhibitor. The mice were injected with 2.5 mg/kg NJK14047 or vehicle every other day for 3 months. Morris water maze task and histological imaging analysis were performed. Protein and mRNA expression levels were measured using immunoblotting and qRT-PCR, respectively. In vitro studies were conducted to measure the cytotoxicity of microglia- and astrocyte-conditioned medium on primary neurons using the MTT assay and TUNEL assay. RESULTS: NJK14047 treatment downregulated phospho-p38 MAPK levels, decreased the amount of Aβ deposits, and reduced spatial learning memory loss in 9-month-old 5XFAD mice. While the pro-inflammatory conditions were decreased, the expression of alternatively activated microglial markers and microglial phagocytic receptors was increased. Furthermore, NJK14047 treatment reduced the number of degenerating neurons labeled with Fluoro-Jade B in the brains of 5XFAD mice. The neuroprotective effect of NJK14047 was further confirmed by in vitro studies. CONCLUSION: Taken together, a selective p38α/β MAPK inhibitor NJK14047 successfully showed therapeutic effects for AD in 5XFAD mice. Based on our data, p38 MAPK inhibition is a potential strategy for AD therapy, suggesting NJK14047 as one of the promising candidates for AD therapeutics targeting p38 MAPKs.",Alzheimer’s disease| Amyloid-β| Kinase inhibitor| Microglia| P38 mitogen-activated protein kinase,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1059,18501411,"Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior",Neuropeptide Y in the central nucleus of the amygdala suppresses dependence-induced increases in alcohol drinking.,"The anxiolytic effects of neuropeptide Y (NPY) are mediated in part by the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA), a brain region involved in the regulation of alcohol-drinking behaviors. Centrally administered NPY suppresses alcohol drinking in subpopulations of rats vulnerable to the development of high alcohol-drinking behavior. The purpose of the current study was to determine the role of NPY in the CeA on elevated alcohol drinking produced by alcohol dependence. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to respond for 10% w/v alcohol in an operant situation with the use of a supersaccharin fading procedure. Following stabilization of responding, rats were divided into two groups matched for intake and given daily access to either alcohol-containing (9.2% v/v) liquid diet or an isocaloric control diet. Following extended access to the diet and reliable separation of operant responding between dependent and non-dependent rats during 6-h withdrawal tests, all rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae aimed at the CeA. Rats were then infused with 4 NPY doses (0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0 microg/0.5 microl aCSF) in a within-subjects Latin-square design during acute withdrawal and tested for operant alcohol responding 30 min later. Alcohol-dependent rats exhibited higher operant alcohol responding than non-dependent rats when infused with vehicle, but responding was similar in the two groups following infusion of all doses of NPY. These results indicate that NPY abolishes dependence-induced elevations in alcohol drinking and implicate the recruitment of limbic NPY systems in the motivational drive to consume alcohol following the transition to dependence.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In previous in vitro work, we developed small molecule p75(NTR) ligands that inhibited amyloid-β-induced degenerative signaling and prevented neurite degeneration. In the present study, a prototype p75(NTR) ligand, LM11A-31, was administered orally to the Thy-1 hAPP(Lond/Swe) (APP(L/S)) AD mouse model. LM11A-31 reached brain concentrations known to inhibit degenerative signaling without toxicity or induction of hyperalgesia. It prevented deficits in novel object recognition after 2.5 months and, in a separate cohort, deficits in Y-maze performance after 3 months of treatment. Stereology studies found that the number and size of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons, which are normal in APP(L/S) mice, were unaffected. Neuritic dystrophy, however, was readily apparent in the basal forebrain, hippocampus and cortex, and was significantly reduced by LM11A-31, with no effect on amyloid levels. These studies reveal that p75(NTR) is an important and tractable in vivo drug target for AD, with LM11A-31 representing a novel class of therapeutic candidates.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1061,37339206,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Enhancement of the liver's neuroprotective role ameliorates traumatic brain injury pathology.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a pervasive problem worldwide for which no effective treatment is currently available. Although most studies have focused on the pathology of the injured brain, we have noted that the liver plays an important role in TBI. Using two mouse models of TBI, we found that the enzymatic activity of hepatic soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was rapidly decreased and then returned to normal levels following TBI, whereas such changes were not observed in the kidney, heart, spleen, or lung. Interestingly, genetic downregulation of hepatic Ephx2 (which encodes sEH) ameliorates TBI-induced neurological deficits and promotes neurological function recovery, whereas overexpression of hepatic sEH exacerbates TBI-associated neurological impairments. Furthermore, hepatic sEH ablation was found to promote the generation of A2 phenotype astrocytes and facilitate the production of various neuroprotective factors associated with astrocytes following TBI. We also observed an inverted V-shaped alteration in the plasma levels of four EET (epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) isoforms (5,6-, 8,9-,11,12-, and 14,15-EET) following TBI which were negatively correlated with hepatic sEH activity. However, hepatic sEH manipulation bidirectionally regulates the plasma levels of 14,15-EET, which rapidly crosses the blood-brain barrier. Additionally, we found that the application of 14,15-EET mimicked the neuroprotective effect of hepatic sEH ablation, while 14,15-epoxyeicosa-5(Z)-enoic acid blocked this effect, indicating that the increased plasma levels of 14,15-EET mediated the neuroprotective effect observed after hepatic sEH ablation. These results highlight the neuroprotective role of the liver in TBI and suggest that targeting hepatic EET signaling could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for treating TBI.","14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid| astrocytes| liver| soluble epoxide hydrolase| traumatic brain injury",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

However, the extent to which chronic opiate usage modulates the effect of acute morphine is unknown.	Rats were trained to delay discount 20 % sucrose solution and then randomly assigned to either a dependent group that received a nightly 30 mg/kg subcutaneous dose of morphine or a non-dependent group that received a nightly saline injection. Once dependence was established, rats were then assigned to one of four acute morphine doses (0, 1.25, 2.5, 5 mg/kg). For 5 days, delay discounting curves were determined 22.5 h after maintenance doses and 1 h after their prescribed acute injections.	In non-dependent rats, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg doses of morphine caused decreased preference for the large reward at all delays. Acute morphine had no effect on discounting curves in dependent rats.	Morphine dependence can cause tolerance to the effects of acute morphine on delay discounting.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Cerebral ischemia was induced in swiss albino mice by performing BCCAO surgery. Morris water-maze test was utilized to assess the learning ability and memory of the animals. The whole brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS, GSH levels and MPO activity were evaluated as the biochemical parameters. For histopathological evaluation of the cerebral infarct size, TTC staining was employed.	Administration of L-carnosine (500   mg/kg, i.p.) successfully attenuated the manifestations of cerebral ischemia. Higher levels of AChE, TBARS, and MPO were observed in BCCAO treated animals, which were successfully attenuated by treatment with L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning. Whereas administration of L-carnosine and ischemic postconditioning significantly increased the level of GSH in BCCAO treated animals. Moreover, treatment with ranitidine, an H2 blocker (30 NMol, i.c.v) antagonized the neuroprotective actions of L-carnosine evidenced by decrease in MWM performance, increase in the level of AChE and oxidative stress, while decrease in GSH level in brain. The cerebral infarct size was found to be more in BCCAO inflicted animals, which was improved by the administration of L-carnosine, while the cerebral infarct size worsened by treatment with ranitidine (3   nmol, i.c.v.).	It is concluded that L-carnosine exerts neuroprotective effect via involvement of histidine-histamine pathway since the beneficial effects of L-carnosine were abolished by the H2-blocker.",l-carnosine| BCCAO| Cerebral ischemia| histidine-histamine pathway,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke. In this study, we examined the therapeutic effect of GM-CSF on the ischemic brain by activating microglia/macrophages. Rats were subjected to 1-h intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and received an intracarotid injection of GM-CSF (5 ng) or saline immediately after reperfusion. Infarct volume, neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later. An intracarotid injection of GM-CSF reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion. Histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microglia/macrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra. These results suggest that intracarotid injection of GM-CSF may have a therapeutic effect on brain ischemia via activation of microglia/macrophages.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1065,23262119,Experimental neurology,Serotonergic pharmacotherapy promotes cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury.,"Cortical reorganization plays a significant role in recovery of function after injury of the central nervous system. The neural mechanisms that underlie this reorganization may be the same as those normally responsible for skilled behaviors that accompany extended sensory experience and, if better understood, could provide a basis for further promoting recovery of function after injury. The work presented here extends studies of spontaneous cortical reorganization after spinal cord injury to the role of rehabilitative strategies on cortical reorganization. We use a complete spinal transection model to focus on cortical reorganization in response to serotonergic (5-HT) pharmacotherapy without any confounding effects from spared fibers left after partial lesions. 5-HT pharmacotherapy has previously been shown to improve behavioral outcome after SCI but the effect on cortical organization is unknown. After a complete spinal transection in the adult rat, 5-HT pharmacotherapy produced more reorganization in the sensorimotor cortex than would be expected by transection alone. This reorganization was dose dependent, extended into intact (forelimb) motor cortex, and, at least in the hindlimb sensorimotor cortex, followed a somatotopic arrangement. Animals with the greatest behavioral outcome showed the greatest extent of cortical reorganization suggesting that the reorganization is likely to be in response to both direct effects of 5-HT on cortical circuits and indirect effects in response to the behavioral improvement below the level of the lesion.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Possible role for ACE in SCZ was also suggested by ACE activity interaction with dopaminergic mechanisms to modulate abnormalities of sensorimotor gating. In addition, we have demonstrated higher ACE activity in blood of SCZ subjects, its implication in cognitive performance in SCZ and its power as a predictor for SCZ diagnosis.Methods: ACE activity was determined in the serum and in selected brain regions of an animal model presenting SCZ-like behaviour, before and after the treatment with typical and atypical antipsychotics, and also in the serum of animals receiving the psychostimulants amphetamine/lisdexamphetamine.Results: Dopaminergic manipulations with antipsychotics and psychostimulants influenced the ACE activity, but with no correlation with the animal blood pressure.Conclusions: The validity of measuring ACE activity in animal blood to predict activity in the CNS, as well as the lack of correlation between the activity and blood pressure, before and after the treatment with antipsychotics, were confirmed here. Correlations of the present findings with data from clinical studies also strengthen the value of this animal model for studying several aspects of SCZ.",ACE enzyme activity| animal model| blood pressure| central nervous system| schizophrenia,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

DNA methylation may be a possible mechanism for persistence of such memory. Here we injected the DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) inhibitor, 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine (5-aza) into hippocampus CA1 area and prelimbic cortex during the stages of acquisition and expression of cocaine-induced place preference in C57BL/6 mice. Results showed that in CA1 DNA methylation inhibitors could restrain acquisition but had no impact on expression of the cocaine-induced conditioned place preference (CPP). On the contrary, in prelimbic cortex, 5-aza had no effect on acquisition but blocked expression. Our results indicated that DNA methylation in hippocampus is required for learning; while DNA methylation in prelimbic cortex is necessary for memory retrieval. The present finding is consistent with the role of the hippocampus as a structure contributing to cocaine-induced memory acquisition, and prelimbic cortex, a part of prefrontal cortex as an area responsible for cocaine-induced memory retrieval. In conclusion, DNA methylation does play an important role in drug-induced learning and memory although the detailed effect still calls for further research.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

We gave the transgenic (Tg) mice either atorvastatin or pitavastatin from 5-20 months (M) of age, and performed immunohistological analysis [4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE)-positive, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R)-positive neurons, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-positive senile plaque (SP), and insulin receptor (IR)-positive endothelium], and biochemistry analysis (adiponectin and leptin).	The numbers of 4-HNE- and AGE-positive neurons and the sum of ApoE-positive SP size progressively increased with age in amyloid precursor protein (APP)-Tg mice, while the amount of IR-positive endothelium and the number of LDL-R-positive neurons decreased. Adiponectin and leptin serum levels were lower in APP-Tg mice than in non-Tg mice. Treatment with statins reduced the number of AGE-positive neurons from as early as 10 M, preserved the numbers of 4-HNE- and LDL-R-positive neurons and the amount of IR-positive endothelium at 15 M, and reduced the sum of ApoE-positive SP size and adiponectin serum level at 20 M.	Atorvastatin and pitavastatin reduced the level of oxidative stress, as revealed by the presence of 4-HNE and AGE, in AD mouse brains, and that treatment with statins improves insulin signaling and LDL-R/ApoE systems. The beneficial effects of these statins may be associated with direct pleiotropic effects on AD mouse brains, indirect effects through improving the serum adiponectin/leptin balance, or both.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The purpose of this study was to assess the effect of magnolol on the proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and neointima formation in vivo, as well as the related cell signaling mechanisms.	Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) induced proliferation ofVSMCs was assessed using colorimetric assay. Cell cycle progression and mRNA expression of cell cycle associated molecules were determined by flow cytometry and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) respectively. The signaling molecules such as ERK1/2,JNK, P38 and NF-kappaB were determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, rat carotid artery balloon injury model was performed to assess the effect of magnolol on neointima formation in vivo.	Oral administration of magnolol significantly inhibited intimal area and intimal/medial ratio (I/M). Our in vitro assays revealed magnolol dose dependently induced cell cycle arrest at G0/G1. Also, magnolol inhibited mRNA and protein expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 in vitro and in vivo. The cell cycle arrest was associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation and NF-kappaB translocation.	Magnolol suppressed proliferation of VSMCs in vitro and attenuated neointima formation in vivo by inducing cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 through modulation of cyclin D1, cyclin E, CDK4 and CDK2 expression.

Male rats were randomly divided into blank control (C), SD, DEX, and SD+DEX groups. The SD model was established through intraperitoneal injection of DEX. The escape latency was detected through Morris water maze test daily, and the mechanical withdrawal threshold and thermal withdrawal latency were detected for 8 d. The content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in hippocampus homogenate were determined, and the morphological changes in neurons were detected through Nissl staining. The concentration of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and IL-6 in the hippocampus was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the Rac1/protein kinase B (AKT)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) expressions were detected by Western blotting. The changes in immunofluorescence localization of NF-κB were observed by confocal microscopy. Compared with SD group, the escape latency was shortened, original platform-crossing times increased, MDA content declined, SOD activity rose, neurons were arranged orderly and number of Nissl bodies increased in the hippocampal CA1 region, levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6 in the hippocampus decreased, Rac1/AKT/NF-κB expressions were down-regulated, and proportion of NF-κB entering the nucleus declined in SD+DEX group (P < 0.05). DEX can effectively alleviate postoperative hippocampal inflammation and improve cognitive function of SD rats.

In the present study, we expanded our research to DLB. Rifampicin was intranasally administered to 6-month-old A53T-mutant α-synuclein-transgenic mice at 0.1 mg/day for 1 month. The mice displayed memory impairment but no motor deficit at this age, indicating a suitable model of DLB. α-Synuclein pathologies were examined by the immunohistochemical/biochemical analyses of brain tissues. Cognitive function was evaluated by the Morris water maze test. Intranasal rifampicin significantly reduced the levels of [pSer129] α-synuclein in the hippocampus and α-synuclein oligomers in the visual cortex and hippocampus. The level of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in the hippocampus was recovered to the level in non-transgenic littermates. In the Morris water maze, a significant improvement in spatial reference memory was observed in rifampicin-treated mice. Taken together with our previous findings, these results suggest that intranasal rifampicin is a promising remedy for the prevention of neurodegenerative dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and DLB.",dementia with Lewy bodies| intranasal administration| oligomer| prevention| rifampicin| α-synuclein,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

One hundred and twenty SD rats were randomly divided into normal control group, acute necrotizing pancreatitis group and TNFalpha antibody treated group. Acute hemorrhage necrotizing pancreatitis model in rats was induced by retrograde injection of 50 g/L sodium taurocholate into the pancreatobiliary duct. Serum TNFalpha was detected and animals were killed 12 h after drug administration. Changes in content of brain water, MDA and SOD as well as leucocyte adhesion of brain microvessels were measured.	In TNFalpha antibody treated group, serum TNFalpha level was decreased. Content of brain water, MDA and SOD as well as leucocyte adhesion were decreased significantly in comparison with those of acute necrotizing pancreatitis group (P<0.05).

The resulting increased intracranial pressure (ICP) was treated with standard clinical doses of furosemide (0.7 mg/kg), ""mini"" doses of mannitol (0.75 g/kg), or both agents in combination. Mannitol consistently and rapidly reduced ICP in all animals. When results were averaged, furosemide used alone caused a slow reduction in ICP, but the results were variable in individual animals--with ICP actually increased in some. When furosemide and mannitol were given together, the ICP fell rapidly and remained low for considerably longer than after either agent alone.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

A 3-fold or greater rise of specific antibody titres was observed after a single immunization of intact BALB/c mice. In experiments in chronically infected animals a single inoculation of HV resulted in a 3-fold rise of specific antibody titres at 6 days postimmunization but not in later periods (20, 30 days). Administration of larifan, an interferon inducer, but not the immunostimulator myelopide, induced a synergic effect in these experiments. Activation of alpha-interferon production was observed early after combined use of HV and immunostimulators. It is concluded that combined experimental use of HV and immunostimulators activated both specific antibody production and interferon production.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Stress factors play an important role in the etiopathology of both diseases, since increased corticosteroid levels caused by chronic stress indirectly induce neuronal damage. The aim of our experiments was to evaluate the changes induced by stress in the transcription of amyloid precursor protein (APP), mitogen activated protein kinase-1 (MAPK-1) and beta-actin, of which the latest plays a leading role in synaptic plasticity. Additionally we intended to examine how duloxetine - a serotonin-norepinephrin reuptake inhibitor type antidepressant - would modify the stress-induced changes. Wistar rats were exposed to immobilization stress for five hours daily through 21 days, while part of the animals received 45 mg/bwkg of duloxetine. At the end of the third week total RNA was purified from the cortex and hippocampus. The amount of beta-actin, APP and MAPK-1 mRNA was determined by real time PCR method. On protein level, semiquantitative measurement was performed by Western blot. The expression of beta-actin mRNA in the animals exposed to stress was four times as intense as in the control group. The increase in the beta-actin mRNA levels was repressed by the duloxetine treatment. In the case of APP and MAPK-1 no changes were detected. According to the Western blot results, the antidepressant treatment slightly, the drug along with the stress treatment strongly decreased the amount of the beta-actin protein. Our findings indicate that antidepressant treatment with duloxetine could play a protective role against the chronic stress-induced changes in the nervous system, such as disorders of synaptic plasticity, and the consequent cognitive dysfunctions in case of both affective disorders and AD.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, we aimed to evaluate whether fluoxetine attenuates early brain injury (EBI) after SAH. We demonstrated that intraperitoneal injection of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg per day) significantly attenuated brain edema and blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption, microglial activation, and neuronal apoptosis in EBI after experimental SAH, as evidenced by the reduction of brain water content and Evans blue dye extravasation, prevention of disruption of the tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1, claudin-5, and occludin, a decrease of cells staining positive for Iba-1, ED-1, and TUNEL and a decline in IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, MDA, 3-nitrotyrosine, and 8-OHDG levels. Moreover, fluoxetine significantly improved the neurological deficits of EBI and long-term sensorimotor behavioral deficits following SAH in a rat model.

After injection with myelin basic protein, rats developed hind limb paralysis and their spinal cords showed crg-2 mRNA expression and the presence of inflammation. When antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotides to crg-2 (AS-PScrg2) or nonspecific oligonucleotides (AS-PSscram) were infused at rates from 0.18 to 5.4 nmol/hr, they caused hind limb paralysis that was clinically different from EAE and tissue necrosis of the spinal cord. Natural phosphodiester (AS-PO) oligonucleotides that were infused at rates from 1.8 to 5.4 nmol/hr had no toxic effects. AS-POcrg2 reduced the initial appearance of crg-2 mRNA and this may be responsible for the significant reduction in the EAE scores at the height of clinical disease. The antisense treatment did not alter inflammation of the spinal cord. While AS-PS oligonucleotides were unsuitable for intrathecal administration, AS-POcrg2 were not toxic and reduced paralysis due to EAE.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The present study was designed to investigate the pre-treatment effects of naringenin (NAR), a polyphenolic compound on cognitive dysfunction, oxidative stress in the hippocampus, and hippocampal neuron injury in a rat model of AD-TNDCI. The rats were pre-treated with NAR at a selective dose (50mg/kg, orally) for 2 weeks followed by intracerebroventricular-streptozotocin (ICV-STZ) (3mg/kg; 5μl per site) injection bilaterally. Behavioral alterations were monitored after 2 weeks from the lesion using passive avoidance test and Morris water maze paradigm. Three weeks after the lesion, the rats were sacrificed for measuring non-enzymatic [4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), malonaldehyde (MDA), thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS), hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)), protein carbonyl (PC), reduced glutathione (GSH)] content and enzymatic [glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase] activity in the hippocampus, and expression of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) positive neuron, and histopathology of hippocampal neurons. The non-enzymatic level and enzymatic activity was significantly increased and decreased, respectively, with striking impairments in spatial learning and memory, loss of ChAT positive neuron and severe damage to hippocampal neurons in the rat induced by ICV-STZ. These abnormalities were significantly improved by NAR pre-treatment. The study suggests that NAR can protect against cognitive deficits, neuronal injury and oxidative stress induced by ICV-STZ, and may be used as a potential agent in treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as AD-TNDCI.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The VEEV-neutralizing, protective murine mAb 3B4C-4 was humanized using combinatorial antibody libraries and phage-display technology. Humanized VEEV-binding Fabs were evaluated for virus-neutralizing capacity, then selected Fabs were converted to whole immunoglobulin (Ig) G1, and stable cell lines were generated. The humanized mAb Hy4-26C, designated Hy4 IgG, had virus-neutralizing capacity similar to that of 3B4C-4. Passive antibody protection studies with purified Hy4 IgG were performed in adult Swiss Webster mice. As little as 100 ng Hy4 IgG protected 90 % of mice challenged with 100 intraperitoneal (i.p.) mean morbidity (MD(50)) doses of virulent VEEV (Trinidad donkey) 24 h after antibody transfer; also, 500 mug Hy4 IgG protected 80 % of mice inoculated with 100 intranasal MD(50) doses of VEEV. Moreover, 10 mug passive Hy4 IgG protected 70 % of mice from a VEEV challenge dose as great as 10(7) i.p. MD(50). Hy4 IgG also protected mice from challenge with another epizootic VEEV variety, 1C (P676). Importantly, therapeutic administration of the humanized mAb to mice already infected with VEEV cured 90 % of mice treated with Hy4 IgG within 1 h of VEEV inoculation and 75 % of mice treated 24 h after virus infection.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Non-human primate models of ischaemic stroke have been used for various antithrombotic agents; however, to the best of our knowledge, there is no data on the effects of P2Y12 antagonists in models, such as the thrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) monkey model. Accordingly, it remains unclear what level of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) is required for optimal treatment of ischaemic stroke. In the present study, we investigated the effects of prasugrel, a third-generation thienopyridine antiplatelet drug, on platelet aggregation, thrombus formation and cerebral infarct volume in a non-human primate model. Daily oral administration of prasugrel resulted in significant and stable platelet inhibitory effects on Day 3, with IPA values ranging from 31% to 36% at 0.3mg/kg/day and from 44% to 50% at 1mg/kg/day. These IPA levels encompassed values observed in clinical trials of clopidogrel, and were thus selected for further study. In the thrombotic MCAO model, prasugrel increased MCA patency in a dose-dependent manner and significantly reduced ischaemic infarct volume by approximately 70% at 0.3mg/kg/day and 90% at 1mg/kg/day without increasing haemorrhagic infarction. Prasugrel also significantly reduced neurological deficit scores by 60% at 0.3mg/kg/day and 80% at 1mg/kg/day. In conclusion, prasugrel treatment resulted in effective reduction of ischaemic infarction and an associated improvement in neurological function without increasing haemorrhagic infarction. These data suggest that prasugrel monotherapy would be effective for the prevention of thrombotic stroke.",Ischemic stroke| Non-human primate| P2Y(12) antagonist| Platelet| Prasugrel,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Our results showed that intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of scopolamine leads to learning and memory dysfunction, whereas the administration of apigenin (synthetic compound, 100 and 200 mg/kg/day) improved cognitive ability, which was confirmed by behavioral tests such as the T-maze test, novel objective recognition test, and Morris water maze test in mice. In addition, scopolamine-induced lipid peroxidation in the brain was attenuated by administration of apigenin. To further evaluate the protective mechanisms of apigenin on cognitive and memory function, Western blot analysis was carried out. Administration of apigenin decreased the B-cell lymphoma 2-associated X/B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bax/Bcl-2) ratio and suppressed caspase-3 and poly ADP ribose polymerase cleavage. Furthermore, apigenin down-regulated the β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, along with presenilin 1 (PS1) and PS2 protein levels. Apigenin-administered mice showed lower protein levels of a receptor for advanced glycation end-products, whereas insulin-degrading enzyme, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and tropomyosin receptor kinase B (TrkB) expression were promoted by treatment with apigenin. Therefore, this study demonstrated that apigenin is an active substance that can improve cognitive and memory functions by regulating apoptosis, amyloidogenesis, and BDNF/TrkB signaling pathways.",apigenin| cognitive ability| neuronal damage| oxidative stress| scopolamine,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Here we report that a single subcutaneous injection of cellulose ethers (CEs), which are commonly used as inactive ingredients in foods and pharmaceuticals, markedly prolonged the lives of mice and hamsters intracerebrally or intraperitoneally infected with the 263K hamster prion. CEs provided sustained protection even when a single injection was given as long as one year before infection. These effects were linked with persistent residues of CEs in various tissues. More effective CEs had less macrophage uptake ratios and hydrophobic modification of CEs abolished the effectiveness. CEs were significantly effective in other prion disease animal models; however, the effects were less remarkable than those observed in the 263K prion-infected animals. The genetic background of the animal model was suggested to influence the effects of CEs. CEs did not modify prion protein expression but inhibited abnormal prion protein formation in vitro and in prion-infected cells. Although the mechanism of CEs in vivo remains to be solved, these findings suggest that they aid in elucidating disease susceptibility and preventing prion diseases.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In transient ischemia model, rats were subjected to a 1.5-h occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The administration of PF (2.5 and 5 mg kg(-1), s.c.) produced a dose-dependent decrease in both neurological impairment and the histologically measured infarction volume. Similar results were also obtained when PF (2.5, 5, and 10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was given in permanent ischemia model. The neuroprotective effect of PF (10 mg kg(-1), s.c.) was abolished by pretreatment of DPCPX (0.25 mg kg(-1), s.c.), a selective adenosine A1 receptor (A1R) antagonist. PF (10, 40, and 160 mg kg(-1), i.v.) had no effect on mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rates (HR) in the conscious rat. Additionally, PF (10(-3) mol l(-1)) had no effect on noradrenaline- (NA-) or high K+ concentration-induced contractions of isolated rabbit primary artery. In competitive binding experiments, PF did not compete with the binding of [3H]DPCPX, but displaced the binding of [3H]NECA to the membrane preparation of rat cerebral cortex. This binding manner was distinguished from the classical A1R agonists. The results demonstrated that activation of A1R might be involved in PF-induced neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia in rat. However, PF had no 'well-known' cardiovascular side effects of classical A1R agonists. The results suggest that PF might have the potential therapeutic value as an anti-stroke drug.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1086,22851280,"Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)",Growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-I alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats.,"In rats, as in humans, normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, as well as in glutamatergic function. Both growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) levels have been reported to decrease with age, and treatment with either GH or IGF-I can ameliorate age-related cognitive decline. Interestingly, acute GH and IGF-I treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals. However, whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats, when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by GH and IGF-I (des-IGF-I), remains to be determined. To address this issue, we used an in vitro CA1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of GH and IGF-I on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials (fEPSPs), as well as AMPA- and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs, in young adult (10 months) and old (28 months) rats. The results indicated that both GH and IGF-I increased compound-, AMPA-, and NMDA-dependent fEPSPs to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism. Initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the GH-induced enhancement was not mediated by the JAK2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the IGF-I-induced enhancement involved a PI3K-mediated mechanism in old, but not young adults. The present findings are consistent with a role for a GH- or IGF-I-induced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating age-related cognitive impairment in old rats.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Hematopoietic neuroprotective agents, such as erythropoietin (EPO) may rescue neurons from cell death in this setting. EPO is a cytokine hormone that has neuroprotective effect in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we evaluated the effect of posthypoxic EPO administration in an animal model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic injury. Our results show that a single intracerebroventricular injection of EPO immediately after hypoxic-ischemic insult in neonatal rat model of hypoxic-ischemia reduced the extent of hypoxic-ischemic brain damage. The mean infarct volume assessed 7 days after hypoxia was significantly smaller in EPO-treated group than in the control group.

However, the detailed mechanisms underlying the transition of astrocytes from the resting state to the reactive state during neurodegenerative disease largely remain to be defined. Here, we investigated the pathways involved in activating astrocytes from the resting state to the reactive state in primary cultured astrocytes treated with oligomeric Aβ and in the hippocampus of 5XFAD mice. Treatment with oligomeric Aβ induced an increase in reactive astrocytes, as assessed by the protein level of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and this increase was caused by STAT3 phosphorylation in primary cultured astrocytes. The administration of Stattic, an inhibitor of STAT3, rescued the activation of astrocytes in primary cultured astrocytes and in the hippocampus of 6-month-old 5XFAD mice as well as impairments in learning and memory. Collectively, these results demonstrated that reactive astrocytes in the AD brain are induced via STAT3 and the impairments in learning and memory observed in 5XFAD mice are rescued by STAT3 inhibition, suggesting that the inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation in astrocytes may be a novel therapeutic target for cognitive impairment in AD.",5XFAD mice| Alzheimer's disease| Astrocyte| JAK / STAT3| Memory,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of ACE in this model and to compare the treatment with the ACE inhibitor ramiprilat with that with the angiotensin II antagonist HR 720. The endothelial layer of the left carotid artery was removed using an inflated balloon catheter. Injured and control vessels were both submitted to histomorphological analysis and DNA content quantification at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 14 days after injury. Evaluation of neointima thickening demonstrated a slow but steady increase of neointima that was significant after day 6 and reached 30% of the lumen in 2 weeks. This was paralleled by an increase in DNA content, which was significant 4 days after injury. ACE mRNA levels were quantified by polymerase chain reaction after reverse transcription. Measurement of ACE mRNA levels revealed a significant upregulation 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. ACE activity was also significantly enhanced at 2 and 8 days after injury, with no significant difference when compared with control tissue at later time points. In addition, the treatment with ramiprilat was more efficient in reducing neointima formation than that with HR 720. These data underlie the role of ACE in this model of restenosis. The early induction of ACE expression after endothelial injury but before significant changes in the vessel structure suggests that ACE activity might be one of the mechanisms that trigger neointima formation in the rat.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1093,37669383,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Nasal administration of anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody ameliorates disease in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Emerging evidence suggests that dysregulation of neuroinflammation, particularly that orchestrated by microglia, plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Danger signals including dead neurons, dystrophic axons, phosphorylated tau, and amyloid plaques alter the functional phenotype of microglia from a homeostatic (M0) to a neurodegenerative or disease-associated phenotype, which in turn drives neuroinflammation and promotes disease. Thus, therapies that target microglia activation constitute a unique approach for treating AD. Here, we report that nasally administered anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody in the 3xTg AD mouse model reduced microglial activation and improved cognition independent of amyloid beta deposition. In addition, gene expression analysis demonstrated decreased oxidative stress, increased axogenesis and synaptic organization, and metabolic changes in the hippocampus and cortex of nasal anti-CD3 treated animals. The beneficial effect of nasal anti-CD3 was associated with the accumulation of T cells in the brain where they were in close contact with microglial cells. Taken together, our findings identify nasal anti-CD3 as a unique form of immunotherapy to treat Alzheimer's disease independent of amyloid beta targeting.",3xTg mice| T cells| microglia| nasal anti-CD3,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Mean renal BT (sec) increased (p < 0.05) in all TGX-221 groups (3 + 3: 510 + 26; 1 + 1: 478 + 41; 0.3 + 0.3: 246 + 37) versus vehicle (123 + 9). For comparison, a reference agent, aspirin (30 mpk, i.p.) increased tail BT 1.9X and renal BT 2.6X.	The novel finding of a clear impact on hemostasis by TGX-221 was demonstrated by increased bleeding in two models in mice at anti-thrombotic doses.

1095,17011205,Neurobiology of disease,Oral uridine pro-drug PN401 is neuroprotective in the R6/2 and N171-82Q mouse models of Huntington's disease,"Previously, uridine pro-drug 2',3',5'-tri-O-acetyluridine (PN401) was shown to be protective in the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor 3-nitropropionic acid model of Huntington's disease (HD). In this study, PN401 increased survival and improved motor function on the rotarod in both R6/2 and N171-82Q polyglutamine repeat mouse models of HD. PN401 significantly decreased neurodegeneration in both the piriform cortex and striatum although PN401 decreased huntingtin protein aggregates only in the striatum. Cortical and striatal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein levels were reduced in the +/- compared to the -/- N171-82Q mice and PN401 treatment significantly increased cortical BDNF in both +/- and -/- mice, but PN401 did not affect striatal BDNF. These results suggest that PN401 may have beneficial effects in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as HD.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1096,34549339,Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN,Resveratrol Improves Synaptic Plasticity in Hypoxic-Ischemic Brain Injury in Neonatal Mice via Alleviating SIRT1/NF-κB Signaling-Mediated Neuroinflammation.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is an obstinate disease that troubles neonatologists. At present, cognitive impairment after HIE has received increasing attention. Synaptic plasticity determines the development of cognitive function, so it is urgent to develop new drugs that can improve HIE-induced cognitive impairment. Hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced neuroinflammation affects synaptic plasticity. As a SIRT1 agonist, resveratrol has a powerful anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it has an effect on impaired synaptic plasticity in HIE and the potential mechanism remain unclear. In the present study, resveratrol was used to intervene in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury (HIBI) mice, and the effects on hippocampal synaptic plasticity and further mechanisms were explored through performing neurobehavioral, morphological observations, Golgi sliver staining, western blotting, and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction experiments. We first found that resveratrol improves HI-induced long-term cognitive and memory deficits, and then we found that resveratrol reduces hippocampal neuronal damage and increases dendritic spine density and the expression of synaptic proteins. Finally, we found that this effect may be exerted by regulating the neuroinflammatory response mediated by the SIRT1/NF-κB axis. This study provides a new theoretical basis for resveratrol to prevent long-term neurological dysfunction following HIBI.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1097,24893798,Neurochemical research,Effects of long-term treatment with quercetin on cognition and mitochondrial function in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Amyloid-β (Aβ)-induced mitochondrial dysfunction has been recognized as a prominent, early event in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, therapeutics targeted to improve mitochondrial function could be beneficial. Quercetin, a bioflavanoid, has been reported to have potent neuro-protective effects, but its preventive effects on Aβ-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairment have not been well characterised. Three-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice were randomly assigned to a vehicle group, two quercetin (either 20 or 40 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) groups, or an Aricept (2 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) group. After 16 weeks of treatment, we observed beneficial effects of quercetin (40 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), including lessening learning and memory deficits, reducing scattered senile plaques, and ameliorating mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species and ATP levels in mitochondria isolated from the hippocampus compared to control. Furthermore, the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity significantly increased in the quercetin-treated (40 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) group. These findings suggest that a reduction in plaque burden and mitochondrial dysfunction through the activation of AMPK may be one of the mechanisms by which quercetin improves cognitive functioning in the APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mouse model of AD.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1098,16267375,Biological research for nursing,Effects of estrogen on platelet reactivity after transient forebrain ischemia in rats.,"Estrogen's prothrombotic effects are of increasing concern, particularly in stroke risk and recovery. Using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. Intact (I), ovariectomized (OVX), and OVX + 17 beta-estradiol (E50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. Using the platelet activation marker P-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. In a separate cohort (I, OVX, E50), the authors quantified platelet eNOS by Western blot. Another cohort (OVX, E50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. Collagen-stimulated platelet P-selectin expression was increased in the OVX rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. No differences in platelet eNOS expression were detected among groups. Cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the OVX and the E50 rats. The authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. Estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet eNOS depression. Neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. In this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

METHODS: Parkinson was induced by intracerebroventricular (i.c.v) injection of 6- hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) (200 μg/rat). 72 h later, the treatment was initiated by i.c.v administration of SB (30 nmol/rat) and/or OX-A (0.3 nmol/rat) for 10 days. Motor functions were monitored using rotarod and hanging tests. Cognitive function was assessed by passive avoidance test (Shuttle box). Results: OX-A administration in 6-OHDA treated rats remarkably increased the time which animals run on rod (in rotarod test) and also the latency to fall (in hanging test) (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Conversely, administration of SB in 6-OHDA-treated rats decreased the mentioned indices (P < 0.05 for latency to fall). Administration of agonist and/or antagonist of orexin-1 receptors had no significant effect on 6-OHDA induced cognitive impairment in rats. CONCLUSION:  Results of this study suggest that the orexinergic system might be involved in sensory-motor deficits of Parkinson's disease.",6- hydroxydopamine| Parkinson’s disease| SB.334867| orexin-a| rat,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

DESIGN: The cerebral effects of a single intravenous injection of cocaine (4 mg/kg) given 30 mins after pretreatment with propranolol (1 mg/kg) were studied and compared with the results from a previous study using an identical cocaine protocol without propranolol pretreatment. SUBJECTS: Seven chronically catheterized, unanesthetized newborn sheep (6 +/- 1 days old). MEASUREMENTS: Cerebral blood flow using radiolabeled microspheres, mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), heart rate, and cerebral arterial and venous oxygen content were measured at baseline, after administration of propranolol, and 0.5, 5, 15, and 60 mins after cocaine injection. Cerebrovascular resistance was calculated as the MAP divided by the cerebral blood flow. MAIN RESULTS: Propranolol injection alone caused no systemic or cerebral physiologic changes other than an 11 +/- 2% (mean +/- SEM) decrease in heart rate, which was sustained after cocaine injection. In contrast to previous studies showing cerebral vasodilation (25% decrease in cerebrovascular resistance) and acute hypertension (57% increase in MAP) 30 secs after cocaine injection, there were no changes in cerebrovascular resistance after cocaine injection and after propranolol pretreatment and there was only a 23 +/- 7% increase in MAP 30 secs after injection, with a return to baseline by 15 mins. Cocaine and norepinephrine levels were similar to those previously reported in the newborn sheep after an injection of 4 mg/kg cocaine. CONCLUSION: Propranolol blocks cocaine-induced cerebral vasodilation and blunts the acute hypertension in newborn sheep, suggesting that cocaine's cerebrovascular effects in the developing brain are mediated, at least in part, by beta-adrenergic receptor activation.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1101,29883694,Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,Effect of mannose targeting of hydroxyl PAMAM dendrimers on cellular and organ biodistribution in a neonatal brain injury model,"Neurotherapeutics for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders must overcome challenges relating to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), brain tissue penetration, and the targeting of specific cells. Neuroinflammation mediated by activated microglia is a major hallmark of several neurological disorders, making these cells a desirable therapeutic target. Building on the promise of hydroxyl-terminated generation four polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimers (D4-OH) for penetrating the injured BBB and targeting activated glia, we explored if conjugation of targeting ligands would enhance and modify brain and organ uptake. Since mannose receptors [cluster of differentiation (CD) 206] are typically over-expressed on injured microglia, we conjugated mannose to the surface of multifunctional D4-OH using highly efficient, atom-economical, and orthogonal Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) click chemistry and evaluated the effect of mannose conjugation on the specific cell uptake of targeted and non-targeted dendrimers both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro results indicate that the conjugation of mannose as a targeting ligand significantly changes the mechanism of dendrimer internalization, giving mannosylated dendrimer a preference for mannose receptor-mediated endocytosis as opposed to non-specific fluid phase endocytosis. We further investigated the brain uptake and biodistribution of targeted and non-targeted fluorescently labeled dendrimers in a maternal intrauterine inflammation-induced cerebral palsy (CP) rabbit model using quantification methods based on fluorescence spectroscopy and confocal microscopy. We found that the conjugation of mannose modified the distribution of D4-OH throughout the body in this neonatal rabbit CP model without lowering the amount of dendrimer delivered to injured glia in the brain, even though significantly higher glial uptake was not observed in this model. Mannose conjugation to the dendrimer modifies the dendrimer's interaction with cells, but does not minimize its inherent inflammation-targeting abilities.",Activated glia| CD206| Cerebral palsy| Dendrimer| Mannose receptors| Nanoparticle| Neuroinflammation| Targeting,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1102,35457070,International journal of molecular sciences,The Memory Benefit to Aged APP/PS1 Mice from Long-Term Intranasal Treatment of Low-Dose THC,"THC has been used as a promising treatment approach for neurological disorders, but the highly psychoactive effects have largely warned off many scientists from pursuing it further. We conducted an intranasal treatment using low-dose THC on 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice daily for 3 months to overcome any potential psychoactive response induced by the systemic delivery. Our results demonstrate that the THC nasal treatment at 0.002 and 0.02 mg/kg significantly slowed the memory decline compared to that in the vehicle-treated transgenic mouse control group. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that the Aβ1-40 and 1-42 peptides decreased in the THC-treated groups. The Western blot data indicate that long-term low-dose THC intranasal administration promoted p-tau level reduction and mitochondrial function marker redistribution. The blood biochemical parameter data demonstrate some insignificant changes in cytokine, immunoglobulin, and immune cell profiles during intranasal THC treatment. Intranasal delivery is a non-invasive and convenient method that rapidly targets therapeutics to the brain, minimizing systemic exposure to avoid unwanted adverse effects. Our study provides new insights into the role of low-dose THC intranasal treatment as a pharmacological strategy to counteract alterations in Alzheimer's disease-related cognitive performance.",APP/PS1| THC| amyloid beta| p-tau,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Preventing microglial activation to inhibit neuroinflammation may become a potential target for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Guizhi Fuling capsule (GZFL) has a strong repression on inflammatory responses. Here, the presenilin1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a well-established mouse model of AD, were divided into: WT mice (WT), WT mice+GZFL (WT+GZFL), PS cDKO mice (cDKO), and PS cDKO mice+GZFL (cDKO+GZFL). Mice in the WT+GZFL and cDKO+GZFL group were fed standard chow containing 2000 ppm GZFL for 90 days. After 60 days of GZFL treatment, mice were given to behavioral tests for 30 days in order to explore the effects of GZFL on cognitive and motor function. Then, mice were sacrificed for examining the effects of GZFL on inflammation. Furthermore, primary microglia were obtained from neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats and pretreated with or without GZFL (50 μg/ml) for 1 h in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (100 ng/ml) stimulation to speculate whether the underlying mechanism of GZFL's anti-inflammatory potential was closely associated with Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that GZFL has the ability to alleviate memory deficits in PS cDKO mice, which attributes to the improvement of neuroinflammation by inhibiting microglial activation and the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. In addition, GZFL could inverse the tau hyperphosphorylation and the lessened expression of synaptic proteins in hippocampus of PS cDKO mice. Furthermore, GZFL prevented LPS-induced neuroinflammatory responses in primary microglia by decreasing the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators. It is noteworthy that therapeutic effects of GZFL on memory impairment are depended on the inhibition of neuroinflammatory responses by the blockage of JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Taken together, GZFL may be an effective compound Chinese medicine for the improvement and postponement of neurodegenerative progression in AD.",Alzheimer’s disease| Guizhi Fuling capsule| JAK2/STAT3 pathway| memory deficits| microglial activation| neuroinflammation,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The level of lipoperoxide (LPO) in the erythrocytes of SHRSP loaded with salt for 22 days was significantly higher than that of the controls. Idebenone treatment (30 mg/kg per day, p.o.) markedly decreased the LPO to the level of the controls. Hemolysis in SHRSP was accelerated by the salt-loading. Idebenone significantly inhibited the hemolysis in a dose-dependent manner.

1105,1691458,Neuropharmacology,Chronic administration of benzodiazepines--V. Rapid onset of behavioral and neurochemical alterations after discontinuation of alprazolam.,"Discontinuation of chronic treatment with alprazolam may cause a characteristic clinical syndrome. To assess the basis of this syndrome, mice were treated with alprazolam, 2 mg/kg, for 7 days, a regimen associated with the development of tolerance and downregulation of receptors. Effects on motor activity and the binding and function of GABA receptors were evaluated 1, 2, 4 and 7 days after discontinuation. Motor activity was similar to controls 1 day after cessation of alprazolam, increased from days 2 to 4 after-alprazolam, and returned to control values by 7 days. The binding of benzodiazepines in vivo and in vitro was increased in the cortex 2 and 4 days after alprazolam and in the hypothalamus at 4 days after alprazolam. Binding returned to control values in all areas by 7 days. Binding at the chloride channel, using [35S]t-butylbicyclophosphorothionate, was not significantly altered after discontinuation. Muscimol-stimulated uptake of [36Cl-] in cortical synaptoneurosomes was increased at 4 days after alprazolam, compared to days 1, 2 and 7. Thus, behavioral and neurochemical alterations was associated with the discontinuation of alprazolam. These alterations were qualitatively similar to those observed following discontinuation of lorazepam but occurred more rapidly and with differing regional specificity.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1106,25386957,Translational psychiatry,Long-term exposure to intranasal oxytocin in a mouse autism model,"Oxytocin (OT) is a neuropeptide involved in mammalian social behavior. It is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies in healthy rodents (prairie voles and C57BL/6J mice) have shown that there may be detrimental effects of long-term intranasal administration, raising the questions about safety and efficacy. To investigate the effects of OT on the aspects of ASD phenotype, we conducted the first study of chronic intranasal OT in a well-validated mouse model of autism, the BTBR T+ Itpr3tf/J inbred strain (BTBR), which displays low sociability and high repetitive behaviors. BTBR and C57BL/6J (B6) mice (N=94) were administered 0.8  IU/kg of OT intranasally, daily for 30 days, starting on day 21. We ran a well-characterized set of behavioral tasks relevant to diagnostic and associated symptoms of autism, including juvenile reciprocal social interactions, three-chambered social approach, open-field exploratory activity, repetitive self-grooming and fear-conditioned learning and memory, some during and some post treatment. Intranasal OT did not improve autism-relevant behaviors in BTBR, except for female sniffing in the three-chambered social interaction test. Male saline-treated BTBR mice showed increased interest in a novel mouse, both in chamber time and sniffing time, whereas OT-treated male BTBR mice showed a preference for the novel mouse in sniffing time only. No deleterious effects of OT were detected in either B6 or BTBR mice, except possibly for the lack of a preference for the novel mouse's chamber in OT-treated male BTBR mice. These results highlight the complexity inherent in understanding the effects of OT on behavior. Future investigations of chronic intranasal OT should include a wider dose range and early developmental time points in both healthy rodents and ASD models to affirm the efficacy and safety of OT.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1107,12941437,Life sciences,Modulation of MK-801-elicited mouse popping behavior by galantamine is complex and dose-dependent.,"The ability of phencyclidine (PCP), a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission, to precipitate a schizophreniform psychosis in susceptible individuals is consistent with the hypothesized pathologic occurrence of NMDA receptor hypofunction in this disorder. Because the psychosis caused by PCP resembles schizophrenia in all of the relevant domains of psychopathology, investigators have sought to characterize animal models of NMDA receptor hypofunction. MK-801 (dizocilpine) binds to the same hydrophobic channel domain in the NMDA receptor-associated ionophore as PCP, and has been shown to elicit intense irregular episodes of jumping behavior in mice, termed 'popping.' MK-801-elicited mouse popping is an animal model of NMDA receptor hypofunction that has been used to screen novel candidate compounds for the treatment of schizophrenia. Recently, a selective abnormality in the transduction of the acetylcholine signal at the level of the alpha 7 nicotinic receptor has been described in schizophrenia. The existence of a nicotinic cholinergic abnormality in schizophrenia has stimulated interest in a potential therapeutic role for positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic receptors. Galantamine is a compound that possesses two interesting properties: inhibition of acetylcholinesterase and positive allosteric modulation of nicotinic neurotransmission. Theoretically, galantamine would be expected to increase the efficiency or likelihood that acetylcholine will promote channel opening and ionic conductance at nicotinic receptors. As expected, in the current investigation statistically significant popping behavior was elicited by MK-801 in mice (T(22) = 2.16, P < 0.05). This MK-801-elicited popping was significantly attenuated by 100 mg/kg of galantamine (T(22) = 2.24, P < 0.05). The data show that nicotinic interventions can influence NMDA receptor-mediated neurotransmission in the intact mouse.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, the interaction between the opioid receptor antagonist and NO was investigated on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced HE in cirrhotic rats. Male rats were divided in the sham- and bile duct ligation (BDL)-operated groups. Animals were treated with saline; naltrexone (10 mg/kg, i.p.); or L-NAME (3 mg/kg, i.p.), alone or in combination with naltrexone. To induce HE, LPS (1 mg/kg, i.p.) was injected 1 h after the final drug treatment. HE scoring, hepatic histology, and plasma NO metabolites levels and mortality rate were recorded. Deteriorated level of consciousness and mortality after LPS administration significantly ameliorated following both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone in cirrhotic rats. However, acute and chronic administration of L-NAME did not change HE scores in cirrhotic rats. The effects of acute but not chronic treatment of naltrexone on HE parameters were reversed by L-NAME. Plasma NOx concentrations elevated in BDL rats, which were decreased after acute and chronic treatment by naltrexone or L-NAME, significantly. We suggest both acute and chronic treatment with naltrexone improved LPS-induced HE.

We developed a methodology to evaluate the repeated intranasal delivery of neuroactive compounds on the non-human primate (NHP) brain, without the need for sedation. We evaluated the effects of the neuroactive peptide, DNSP-11 following repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation over the course of 10-weeks in Rhesus macaques. This approach allowed us to examine striatal target engagement, safety and tolerability, and brain distribution following a single [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 dose.	Our initial data support that repeated intranasal delivery and dose-escalation of DNSP-11 resulted in bilateral, striatal target engagement based on neurochemical changes in dopamine (DA) metabolites-without observable, adverse behavioral effects or weight loss in NHPs. Furthermore, a [125]I-labeled DNSP-11 study illustrates diffuse rostral to caudal distribution in the brain including the striatum-our target region of interest.	The results of this study are compared to our experiments in normal and 6-OHDA lesioned rats, where DNSP-11 was repeatedly delivered intranasally using a micropipette with animals under light sedation.	The results from this proof-of-concept study support the utility of our repeated intranasal dosing methodology in awake Rhesus macaques, to evaluate the effects of neuroactive compounds on the NHP brain. Additionally, results indicate that DNSP-11 can be safely and effectively delivered intranasally in MPTP-treated NHPs, while engaging the DA system.",Drug delivery| Intranasal| Parkinson’s disease| Peptide,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

This has fostered hope that PPAR agonists might have neuroprotective potential. We hypothesized that PPARδ activation by the novel orally administered lipophilic PPARδ agonist SAR145 may improve short- and long-term outcome after focal brain ischemia. We induced ischemia by transient filamentous middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) in 227 C57BL/6 mice and administered SAR145 in varying doses and time windows post-injury. Outcome was assessed by three functional tests and histologically determining ischemic lesion sizes. In a second experiment, we tested SAR145 treatment in 40 PPARδ-knockout mice using the same procedures. Three independent groups treated with 10 mg/kg bodyweight SAR145 directly after filament removal showed a mean reduction in lesion sizes of 18 ± 10% compared to vehicle-treated groups. We did not observe a consistent improvement in the long-term functional outcome by SAR145-treatment. PPARδ-knockout mice showed a significantly higher mortality after MCAo. As expected, we did not find a reduction of lesion size by SAR145-treatment in PPARδ-knockout mice. In summary, we found no evidence of a long-term neuroprotective effect of post-injury SAR145 treatment in cerebral ischemia.

OBJECTIVE: The effects of a nanoparticle intranasal formulation, the Eagle Research Formulation of Ryanodex (ERFR), in young adult and aged wild type and PS19 tau transgenic mice was investigated. METHODS: The bioavailability of intranasal ERFR was measured in 2 and 9-11-month-old C57BL/6J mice. Blood and brain samples were collected 20 minutes after a single ERFR dose, and the plasma and brain concentrations were analyzed. Baseline behavior was assessed in untreated PS19 tau transgenic mice at 6 and 9 months of age. PS19 mice were treated with intranasal ERFR, with or without acrolein (to potentiate cognitive dysfunction), for 3 months, beginning at 2 months of age. Animal behavior was examined, including cognition (cued and contextual fear conditioning, y-maze), motor function (rotarod), and olfaction (buried food test). RESULTS: The dantrolene concentration in the blood and brain decreased with age, with the decrease greater in the blood resulting in a higher brain to blood concentration ratio. The behavioral assays showed no significant changes in cognition, olfaction, or motor function in the PS19 mice compared to controls after chronic treatment with intranasal ERFR, even with acrolein. CONCLUSIONS: Our studies suggest the intranasal administration of ERFR has higher concentrations in the brain than the blood in aged mice and has no serious systemic side effects with chronic use in PS19 mice.",Alzheimer’s disease| PS19 mice| blood-brain barrier| calcium| cognition| dantrolene| pharmacokinetics| ryanodine receptor| tau protein| therapeutics,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1114,29512783,Molecular medicine reports,Therapeutic window for YC‑1 following glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and transient focal cerebral ischemia.,"3-(5'-Hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1), has been demonstrated to inhibit platelet aggregation, vascular contraction and hypoxia‑inducible factor 1 activity in vitro and in vivo. The present study investigated the neuroprotective efficacy of YC‑1 in cultured neurons exposed to glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity and in an animal model of stroke. In a cortical neuronal culture model, YC‑1 demonstrated neurotoxicity at a concentration >100 µM, and YC‑1 (10‑30 µM) achieved potent cytoprotection against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage. Additionally, YC‑1 (30 µM) effectively attenuated the increase in intracellular Ca2+ levels. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) also protected against glutamate‑induced neuronal damage and cell swelling in cultured neurons, though only at 4 h post‑treatment. In addition, immediate treatment of YC‑1 (30 µM) following the exposure of cortical neurons to glutamate (300 µM) produced a marked reduction in intracellular pH. Delayed treatment of YC‑1 (25 mg/kg) protected against ischemic brain damage in vivo, though only when administered at 3 h post‑insult. Thus, YC‑1 exhibited neuroprotection against glutamate-induced neuronal damage and in mice subjected to transient focal cerebral ischemia. This neuroprotection may be mediated via its ability to limit the glutamate‑induced excitotoxicity. However, the neuroprotective therapeutic window of YC‑1 is only at 3 h in vivo and 4 h in vitro, which may, at least in part, be attributed to its ability to reduce the intracellular pH in the early phase of ischemic stroke. Although YC‑1 provided the potential for clinical therapy, the treatment time point must be carefully evaluated following ischemia.",3-(5'-Hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole| glutamate| intracellular pH| therapeutic window| ischemic stroke,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1115,6324347,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Anatomically distinct opiate receptor fields mediate reward and physical dependence.,Rats never before exposed to opioids rapidly learned to press a lever for microinjections of morphine into the ventral tegmental area. Challenge by a narcotic antagonist produced no signs of physical dependence. Dependence was not seen after long-term morphine infusions into the ventral tegmentum but was seen after similar infusions into the periventricular gray region. Thus a major rewarding property of morphine is independent of the drug's ability to produce physical dependence. These data challenge models of drug addiction that propose physical dependence as necessary for the rewarding effects of opioids.,,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1116,32093571,Nutritional neuroscience,Piperine mitigates behavioral impairments and provides neuroprotection against 3-nitropropinoic acid-induced Huntington disease-like symptoms.,"Background: Piperine (PIP) is a powerful anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory alkaloid which has been widely used in the treatment of various pathological conditions. However, few studies have clearly discussed the protective effects and potential mechanism of PIP in different neurological diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PIP against 3-nitropropioninc acid (3-NP) induced neurobehavioral, biochemical and histopathological alterations in animals.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups. Group 1, the vehicle administered control group, received normal saline (p.o.). Group 2 received 3-NP (20 mg/kg.b.wt., i.p.) for 4 consecutive days. Group 3 received PIP (10 mg/kg.b.wt., p.o.) twice daily for a period of 4 days, 30 min before and 6 h after the 3-NP injection. Upon termination of treatment schedule, behavioral experiments were performed to access the behavioral outcomes. The brain striatal tissue was used for the estimation of monoamine oxidase activity and serotonin level. In addition, astrocytes activation was observed by GFAP immunostaining.Results: Our results showed that 3-NP induced behavioral impairments are attenuated by PIP co-treatment. Next, the extent of neuronal loss and astrocytes activation was reduced in the striatal brain region in PIP treated rats. Finally, it was observed that PIP alleviated the behavioral, biochemical, immunohistochemical and histological alterations.Conclusion: The results of the current study reveal the neuroprotective competency of PIP against Huntington disease like symptoms in rats.",3-nitropropioninc acid| Huntington’s disease| behavioural impairments| neuroprotection| piperine,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1117,17459424,Microvascular research,"Effects of L-arginine on cerebral blood flow, microvascular permeability, number of perfused capillaries, and brain water content in the traumatized mouse brain.","It is has been suggested that decreased production of the vasodilatory and anti-aggregative substance NO (nitric oxide) may result in lower cerebral blood flow (CBF) in injured areas of the traumatized brain. The NO-precursor L-arginine has been shown to counteract CBF decreases early after trauma, but microcirculatory and more long-term effects on CBF of L-arginine have not been investigated. In an attempt to analyze effects of L-arginine on the microcirculation in the traumatized brain, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of L-arginine compared to vehicle (0.9% saline) following a standardized controlled cortical-impact brain trauma in mice. Cerebral blood flow (autoradiography [(14)C]-iodoantipyrine), number of perfused capillaries (FITC-dextran fluorescence technique), brain water content (wet vs. dry weight) and the blood to brain transfer constant K(i) for [(51)Cr]-EDTA were analyzed in the injured and the contralateral cortex. Cortical blood flow in the injured cortex was 0.43+/-0.3 mL/g/min and 0.81+/-0.3 mL/g/min 3 h after trauma in the vehicle and L-arginine groups, respectively (p<0.05), and no treatment effect was seen 24 h after trauma. The number of perfused capillaries decreased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. K(i) increased following trauma and was unaffected by L-arginine. Brain water content was lower in the L-arginine group than in the vehicle group 3 h after trauma and there was no difference between the groups 24 h after trauma. We conclude that L-arginine reduces brain edema formation and improves cortical blood flow in the early phase after a brain trauma, whereas no circulatory effects can be seen after prolonged treatment.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In this study, we developed Bo-TSA-NP, a novel tanshinone IIA (TSA) loaded nanoparticles modified by borneol, which has long been proved with the ability to enhance other drugs' transport across the BBB. The Bo-TSA-NP, with a particle size of about 160 nm, drug loading of 3.6%, showed sustained release and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibition property. It demonstrated a significantly higher uptake by 16HBE cells in vitro through the clathrin/caveolae-mediated endocytosis and micropinocytosis. Following intranasal (IN) administration, Bo-TSA-NP significantly improved the preventive effect on a rat model of CIRI with improved neurological scores, decreased cerebral infarction areas and a reduced content of malondialdehyde (MDA) and increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in rat brain. In conclusion, these results indicate that Bo-TSA-NP is a promising nose-to-brain delivery system that can enhance the prevention effect of TSA on CIRI.",PEG–PLGA nanoparticles| borneol| cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury| intranasal delivery| tanshinone IIA,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Xenon (Xe) is a general anesthetic with neuroprotective effects.	Here, we investigate the neuroprotective role of Xe in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)- and hypoxia-ischemia (HI)-induced white matter damage (WMD) model.	Three-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham group (group A, n = 24), an LPS + HI group (group B, n = 24), and an LPS + HI + Xe group (group C, n = 72). The onset of Xe inhalation started at 0, 2, and 5 h in subgroups C1, C2, and C3, respectively. Next, we performed TUNEL and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining; and examined the expression of CLIC4 and Bcl-2 in brain tissues.	HE staining revealed distorted cytoarchitecture, tangled nerve fibers, and pyknosis in group B, while Xe treatment improved these histological alterations in the group C pups. Following LPS and HI insult, the number of apoptotic cells significantly increased in group B at 48 and 72 h (p < 0.05), and Xe significantly alleviated apoptosis (p < 0.001) at 24, 48, and 72 h, respectively. Similarly, CLIC4 mRNA expression was significantly increased in group B (p < 0.05), and Xe produced a marked reduction in CLIC4 mRNA expression in group C subgroups (p < 0.05). Western blotting demonstrated enhanced Bcl-2 expression in group C when compared to group B (p < 0.05).	These results demonstrate that LPS and HI successfully induced WMD, and Xe decreased neuronal apoptosis via Bcl-2- and CLIC4-mediated pathways. Moreover, the therapeutic time window of Xe extended for up to 5 h. These findings suggest that Xe can be used as a protective treatment for WMD in premature infants.",Bcl-2| CLIC4| Hypoxia-ischemia| Lipopolysaccharide| Premature birth| White matter damage| Xenon,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1120,7684468,Journal of virology,Cross-protection against lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus mediated by a CD4+ T-cell clone specific for an envelope glycoprotein epitope of Lassa virus.,"Recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the Lassa virus (LV) envelope glycoprotein precursor, V-LSGPC, was used to study the basis of LV-induced cross-protective immunity against the closely related arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). C3H/HeJ mice primed with V-LSGPC developed neither circulating antibodies nor CD8+ cytotoxic T cells specific for LCMV, yet they resisted a normally lethal LCMV challenge. Spleen cells from such mice gave a proliferative response to LCMV in vitro that was inhibitable by anti-CD4 antibody. Synthetic peptides corresponding to predicted T-cell sites common to the envelope glycoprotein precursor (GP-C) of LV and that of LCMV were used to map the specificity of the proliferative response to an epitope located between amino acids 403 and 417 of LV GP-C. Several CD4+ T-cell clones specific for the 403-417 peptide were isolated and found to produce gamma interferon in response to both the peptide and LCMV. One of these clones, C9, was selected for further study. C9 lysed I-AK-bearing target cells, and when adoptively transferred to C3H/HeJ mice, it was capable of mediating both a peptide-specific delayed hypersensitivity reaction and resistance to lethal LCMV challenge. These collective findings demonstrate, for the first time, that CD4+ T cells can play a major role in arenavirus-specific cross-protective immunity.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1121,22627142,Neurobiology of disease,"Subchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in EEG, cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter EAAT2 in mice.","Ketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic, dissociative, amnestic and euphoric effects. When chronically abused, ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing, even following long-term abstinence from the drug. While animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine, a few animal studies have assessed long-term changes following cessation of ketamine exposure. To this end, the present study assessed event related potentials (ERPs) and EEG oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug. Ketamine-treated mice showed no change in P20, but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later N40 and P80 components, consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure. Additionally, ketamine-treated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations. To assess the functional significance of these changes, mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests, including progressive ratio (motivation), extinction (behavioral flexibility) and win-shift radial maze (spatial memory). Subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory. Analysis of brains from ketamine-treated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by NueN immunohistochemistry, but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter, GLT-1. These results strongly suggest: 1) that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug; 2) that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers; 3) that ERP and EEG measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function; and 4) that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of long-term adaptive or plastic, rather than degenerative, changes.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1122,22778851,ACS chemical neuroscience,Oral treatment with the d-enantiomeric peptide D3 improves the pathology and behavior of Alzheimer's Disease transgenic mice,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) plays a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Not only Aβ fibrils but also small soluble Aβ oligomers in particular are suspected to be the major toxic species responsible for disease development and progression. The present study reports on in vitro and in vivo properties of the Aβ targeting d-enantiomeric amino acid peptide D3. We show that next to plaque load and inflammation reduction, oral application of the peptide improved the cognitive performance of AD transgenic mice. In addition, we provide in vitro data elucidating the potential mechanism underlying the observed in vivo activity of D3. These data suggest that D3 precipitates toxic Aβ species and converts them into nonamyloidogenic, nonfibrillar, and nontoxic aggregates without increasing the concentration of monomeric Aβ. Thus, D3 exerts an interesting and novel mechanism of action that abolishes toxic Aβ oligomers and thereby supports their decisive role in AD development and progression.",Alzheimer’s disease| Mirror image phage display| d-enantiomeric peptide| drugs| oligomers,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1123,2542370,Journal of neuroimmunology,Delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol: a novel treatment for experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis,"Since multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an immune-mediated disease, it follows that its therapies should be directed towards modulating the immune system. Current MS treatments, which include the use of exogenous steroids that are immunosuppressive, do not meet therapeutic objectives. delta 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), an active component of marijuana, has been shown to be immunosuppressive. To test THC's ability to suppress an immune-mediated disease, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the laboratory model of MS, was used. Lewis rats and strain 13 guinea pigs were administered THC either before inoculation for EAE or treated with THC after injection. Control animals received placebo. The effect of dose, in addition to the timing of treatment, was also investigated. All animals treated with placebo developed severe clinical EAE 10-12 days post-injection (d.p.i.) and more than 98% died by 15 d.p.i. THC-treated animals had either no clinical signs or mild signs with delayed onset (13-15 d.p.i.) with survival greater than 95%. Examination of central nervous system tissue revealed a marked reduction of inflammation in the THC-treated animals. Therefore, as THC has been shown to inhibit both clinical and histologic EAE, it may prove to be a new and relatively innocuous agent for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Transient global ischemia was produced by four vessel-occlusion, the occlusion of the bilateral common carotid arteries following the electrocautherization of the vertebral arteries. 3mg/kg of PPS or 300IU/kg of dalteparin was administered i.v. immediately after 7min-occlusion/reperfusion. Seven days after the operation, the animals were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, and paraffinized coronal brain sections measuring 6microm in thickness were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Neuronal damage was then estimated as a ratio of the number of degenerated neurons to that of both the surviving and degenerated neurons in three distinct area of the CA1 subfield. The ratio of neuronal death increased with the length of the occlusion-time, at 5, 7 and 10min. Both PPS and dalteparin significantly inhibited the neuronal damage induced by 7min-occlusion. These results demonstrated that both PPS and dalteparin could thus protect brain neurons against ischemia/reperfusion-induced damage thus suggesting that they may be potentially useful therapeutic agents for acute ischemic stroke.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Neuroprotection in a permanent and a transient focal cerebral ischaemia mouse model (induced by intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO)) was investigated using a range of histological and behavioural assessments. In the permanent ischaemia model, BU43b reduced oedema and showed a trend towards reduction in %HLV (percentage hemisphere lesion volume) when administered at a dose of 30 mg/kg i.p. Following transient ischaemia, treatment with BU43b decreased the %HLV and reduced oedema when administered at 30 mg/kg. BU43b also improved the locomotor activity (LMA) in MCAO mice at both 20 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg doses. BU36b was less effective than BU43b in both the permanent and the transient models, with its most pronounced effect being a trend towards reduction in oedema in both models. These results demonstrate that BU43b administered 30 min before ischaemia provided a good level of neuroprotection in the two models of cerebral ischaemia used and may have potential as a neuroprotective treatment for stroke.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
1126,12854756,Journal of neurosurgery,Neuroprotective activity of tamoxifen in permanent focal ischemia.,"The authors have previously shown that tamoxifen is effective in protecting brain tissue from ischemic injury in a rat model of reversible focal ischemia. In this study the authors tested whether similar protective effects are found in a rat model of permanent focal ischemia (permanent middle cerebral artery [MCA] occlusion).	Tamoxifen (20 mg/kg) was given either before or at 1, 3, or 6 hours after permanent MCA occlusion in rats, with sustaining doses given every 12 hours thereafter. The median infarct volume measured after 72 hours was 113 mm3 for the vehicle (dimethyl sulfoxide) groups, compared with 31 mm3 for pretreatment, and 14, 27, and 98 mm3 for treatment beginning at 1, 3, and 6 hours, respectively, after permanent MCA occlusion. The infarct reductions in the pretreated and 1- and 3-hour post-MCA occlusion treatment groups were statistically significant (p < 0.05). At 3 hours after permanent MCA occlusion, tamoxifen also significantly reduced the infarct size at a lower dose of 5 mg/kg but not at 1 mg/kg; the same sustaining doses of 5 and 1 mg/kg were given every 12 hours.	Tamoxifen is as effective in a permanent model of focal ischemia as it is in the reversible model, and the therapeutic window of 3 hours after initiation of ischemia is identical. This effectiveness is likely due to several properties of the drug, including its known ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Because tamoxifen has been administered safely in humans for treatment of gliomas at similarly high doses to those used in this study, it may be clinically useful as a treatment for ischemic stroke.",,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevoflurane-induced neurobehavioral abnormalities. Here, we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the NLRP3 inflammasome in models of sevoflurane-induced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms. Aged C57BL/6 J mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3% sevoflurane for 2 h. Hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested. The processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylases, increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons. Concomitantly, sevoflurane upregulated components of the NLRP3 inflammasome (NLRP3, cleaved caspase-1, and IL-1β) by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain. Cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and NLRP3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by SAHA. Treatment with 3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor, eliminated the neuroprotective effects of SAHA on improving cognition in mice, activating autophagy and downregulating the NLRP3 inflammasome. Based on these results, histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevoflurane-induced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain.",Autophagy| Cognitive dysfunction| Histone acetylation| NLRP3 inflammasome| Sevoflurane,Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Patients with early-onset AD that exhibits first as psychotic symptoms usually lack obvious cognitive impairment, so they may be misdiagnosed with late-onset schizophrenia. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a patient who had prominent psychotic symptoms at the age of 60 and was initially diagnosed with very-late-onset-schizophrenia-like psychosis. Psychotic symptoms disappeared rapidly after treatment with olanzapine, and the patient later showed extrapyramidal symptoms and decline in cognitive function. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed frontotemporal atrophy, and positron emission tomography (PET) showed extensive areas of hypometabolism in the frontal cortex and head of the caudate nucleus. The patient's SORL1 gene was found to carry a heterozygrous mutation (c.296A > G). The patient was eventually diagnosed with early-onset AD. CONCLUSIONS: Our case suggests that clinicians should consider the possibility of early-onset AD in middle-aged or elderly patients whose first symptoms are the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. To distinguish early-onset AD from late-onset schizophrenia, clinicians should evaluate cognitive function, perform MRI and PET, and search for SORL1 mutations.",Brain imaging| Cognitive function| Dementia| SORL1| Schizophrenia,Human-case-report,4,0

Improvement in behavioral functioning following resection of HHs has been reported. Stereotactic laser ablation (SLA), a minimally invasive technique, has been used for the treatment of HH-related epilepsy. We report the case of child with an HH, gelastic seizures, and severe psychiatric dysfunction who was successfully treated via SLA therapy. CASE DESCRIPTION: The patient was an 11-year-old female with a history of central hypothyroidism, precocious puberty, and localization-related epilepsy thought to be secondary to an HH. She had a significant psychiatric history including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depressed mood, impulsivity, threatening behavior, and suicidal ideation requiring management with dexmethylphenidate, bupropion, and aripiprazole. Seizure onset occurred at age 7, and her semiology included nighttime hypermotor seizures and uncontrollable laughing spells thought to be gelastic seizures. Her hypermotor seizures were successfully managed with oxcabazepine monotherapy, but she continued to have several weekly laughing spells and self-harming behavior. Her HH was successfully treated via SLA. Postoperatively, she remained neurologically intact and was discharged the next day. At her 6-month follow-up, she had a markedly improved affect and general mood. At 3 years postprocedure, she remains seizure free and has been weaned off her antiepileptic and antipsychotic medications. CONCLUSIONS: Severe behavioral dysfunction in the setting of an HH may constitute an indication for surgical intervention. The outcome of this case suggests there may be a role for SLA in the management of HH-related psychiatric dysfunction, even in patients with good seizure control.",Gelastic seizures| Hypothalamic hamartoma| Psychiatric disorder| Psychosis| Stereotactic laser ablation,Human-case-report,4,0

The patient received an intensive eight-session intervention utilizing simulated activities that focused on the recovery of finger extension, finger individuation, and pinch-grasp force modulation.	Over the eight sessions, the patient demonstrated improvements on untrained transfer tasks, which suggest that motor learning had occurred, as well a dramatic increase in hand function and corresponding expansion of the cortical motor map area representing several key muscles of the paretic hand. Recovery of hand function and motor map expansion continued after discharge through the three-month retention testing.	This case study describes a neuroplasticity based intervention for UE hemiparesis and a model for examining the relationship between training, motor skill acquisition, neuroplasticity, and motor function changes. Implications for rehabilitation Intensive hand and finger rehabilitation activities can be added to an in-patient rehabilitation program for persons with subacute stroke. Targeted training of the thumb may have an impact on activity level function in persons with upper extremity hemiparesis. Untrained transfer tasks can be utilized to confirm that training tasks have elicited motor learning. Changes in cortical motor maps can be used to document changes in brain function which can be used to evaluate changes in motor behavior persons with subacute stroke.",Stroke| hand| rehabilitation| robotics| upper extremity| virtual reality,Human-case-report,4,0

Most of the published studies on sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder have focussed on children. Therefore, we performed a systematic review on this topic focussing on the adult population. The review is followed by a case report. The review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses 2020 guidelines. A total of seven manuscripts (n = 32 individuals) were included in the review. The clinical manifestation of body or head rolling predominated in the majority of included cases (53.13% and 43.75%, respectively). In n = 11 (34.37%) cases, a combination of rhythmic movements was observed. The literature review also revealed a wide spectrum of co-morbidities: insomnia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, ischaemic stroke, epilepsy, hypertension, alcohol and drug dependency, mild depression, and diabetes mellitus. The case report presented a 33-year-old female who was referred to the sleep laboratory due to a suspicion of sleep bruxism and obstructive sleep apnea. Although the patient was initially suspected of having obstructive sleep apnea and sleep bruxism, after conducting video-polysomnography she met the criteria for sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder as she presented body rolling, which were surprisingly most evident during the rapid eye movement sleep stage. In summary, the prevalence of sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder among adults has not been determined yet. The present review and case report is a good starting point for discussion regarding rhythmic movement disorder in adults and further research on this topic.",body rolling| polysomnography| rhythmic movements,Human-case-report,4,0

She was treated with intravenous t-PA approximately 4 hours after the onset of symptoms. The patient demonstrated a remarkable recovery 6 hours after onset of her symptoms and had minimal deficits on discharge from the hospital 1 week later. She was found to have a lupus anticoagulant and was heterozygous for the prothrombin gene G2010A mutation. These were likely contributing causes for her stroke.

MSA is a degenerative neurological condition that includes olivopontocerebellar atrophy, Shy-Drager syndrome and striatonigral degeneration. The usual predominant features of MSA are cerebellar ataxia, autonomic dysfunction and Parkinsonism. Stridor is present in over one third of patients and has been reported previously as a presenting symptom in MSA: however previously reported patients have always gone on to develop other neurological symptoms. The usual investigations of bilateral abductor vocal fold paralysis caused by MSA will not reveal the pathological process and we believe that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the medulla and brain stem and autonomic function tests are probably the investigations of choice. It is a worthwhile exercise attempting to identify MSA as the cause of stridor as the prognosis is good in the medium term if appropriate support is offered.",,Human-case-report,4,0
1145,35511103,Journal of psychiatric practice,Association Between Mild Neurocognitive Disorder Due to Alzheimer's Disease and Possible Attention-deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder: A Case Report,"Recent literature concerning attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) underlines the persistence of this neurodevelopmental illness in older patients. Comorbidity with a neurodegenerative disease is thus possible. However, few studies have investigated this topic. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of such a possible association, which raises important questions about clinical presentation, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment. A 72-year-old man, without any psychiatric history, presented with depression, subjective memory loss, and attention deficit and anxious symptoms, and was diagnosed with mild neurocognitive disorder due to Alzheimer's disease. However, the patient's attentional symptoms appeared to have been present since childhood. A formalized diagnostic interview assessing for ADHD did not allow for a clear diagnosis, possibly due to recall bias. The patient's anxiety symptoms also did not respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy coupled with different antidepressants. We hypothesized the presence of ADHD, with the symptoms balanced until now by the patient's high cognitive capacities, and we postulated that the onset of a neurogenerative process may have disrupted this balance. In this case report, we discuss symptom dimensionality, the interplay between neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental diseases, and various treatment options. Attentional deficits and anxiety symptoms are frequent in mild neurocognitive disorders due to neurodegenerative illnesses. It is important to explore the time of onset of such symptoms since neurodegenerative processes can worsen neurodevelopmental conditions. Moreover, identification of a pre-existing neurodevelopmental condition can lead to alternative care and treatment options. In addition, the unexplained worsening of ADHD symptoms should prompt clinicians to assess for a neurodegenerative process.",,Human-case-report,4,0
1146,24238645,BMC nephrology,Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome induced by neoplastic meningitis in a patient receiving maintenance hemodialysis.,"Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome is characterized by neurological symptoms resulting from cerebral edema, which occurs as a consequence of hemodialysis. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome most often occurs in patients who have just started hemodialysis, during hemodialysis, or soon after hemodialysis; although it may also occur in patients who are under maintenance hemodialysis with pre-existing neurological disease.	A 70-year-old woman, who had been receiving maintenance hemodialysis for one year, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer by ascites cytological examination. Two years later, she reported severe headache and nausea during hemodialysis and was diagnosed with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Although brain images revealed mild hydrocephalus without any mass lesions, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma cells were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid. These findings indicated that DDS was induced by neoplastic meningitis due to ovarian cancer metastasis.	Neoplastic meningitis should be considered and excluded in hemodialysis patients with dialysis disequilibrium syndrome and malignancy by cytological examination of the cerebrospinal fluid even if cerebral imaging shows no obvious lesions. This is the first reported case of dialysis disequilibrium syndrome induced by neoplastic meningitis in a patient receiving maintenance hemodialysis.",,Human-case-report,4,0
1147,29429985,The American journal of case reports,Posterior Associative and Cingulate Cortex Involvement of Brain Single-Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) Imaging in Semantic Dementia with Probable Alzheimer Disease Pathology: A Case Report,"BACKGROUND Semantic dementia (SD) is a type of primary progressive aphasia with prominent language dysfunction, mostly within the spectrum of frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Although there is an overlap in clinical manifestations of SD attributable to FTLD and neuropathologically proven Alzheimer disease (AD), clinical diagnostic clues are not readily available. We present a characteristic finding based on a single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)-based regional cerebral blood flow study and its statistical imaging analysis for a rare case of SD with AD-like pathology. CASE REPORT A 61-year-old male was referred to our hospital due to difficulties in self-management and impaired comprehension of word meaning suggestive of SD. Although his brain MRI revealed mild frontal lobe atrophy, his SPECT with three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections (3D-SSP) analysis showed left-sided hypo-perfusion that was more prominent in the inferior temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule, with bilateral frontal lobe hypo-perfusion. The SPECT scan also showed involvement of the right inferior parietal area and, in medial aspects, the posterior cingulate cortex and adjacent precuneus; these finding were compatible with early hypo-perfused areas seen in AD. The lumbar cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings seemed to fit SD in association with probable AD pathology. CONCLUSIONS This is the first reported case to use SPECT with 3D-SSP statistical analysis as a potential, useful imaging modality for the diagnosis of SD with probable AD pathology.",,Human-case-report,4,0

Surgery and/or radiotherapy are indicated when the tumour is resistant to medical treatment and continues growing, causing visual field impairment. Data concerning other therapeutic approach are scanty. Although PRL-secreting tumours may express somatostatin receptors type 2, 3 and 5, somatostatin analogs treatment is generally ineffective and peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) has never been reported.

Case report.	Two academic medical centers. Patient A 7-year-old patient followed up for 4 years.	The patient exhibited a predominant syndrome of chorea and mental retardation associated with a combination of paroxysmal ataxia, dysarthria, dystonia and aggravated intellectual disability induced by fasting or exertion. She harbored a sporadic, heterozygous amino acid insertion in the GLUT1 transporter (insY292) that, in all likelihood, impaired blood-brain glucose flux. Her brain configuration appeared hypotrophic via magnetic resonance imaging, particularly over the occipital lobes. A ketogenic diet resulted in brain growth that accompanied a favorable symptomatic outcome.	To date, glucose transporter type 1 deficiency syndrome includes several epileptic and movement disorder phenotypes caused by the clinical expressivity of the prominent cortical, basal ganglia, and cerebellar abnormalities found in the disease, but hypomorphic or novel variants are probably yet to be discovered.",,Human-case-report,4,0

Here, we report a case of narcolepsy type 2 caused by hippocampal glioma of the right temporal lobe.	A 44-year-old male farmer complained of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) over the past 3 months and more.	The lesion of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was removed and its pathological examination was carried out.	General examination showed no abnormalities of his heart, lungs, or abdomen. Neurological examination showed no positive sign. The blood routine and biochemical examination were normal. He scored 7 on the Pittsburg sleep quality index, 16 on the Epworth sleepiness scale, 52 on the self-rating anxiety scale, and 48 on the self-rating depression scale. The multiple sleep latency test data showed 2 periods of sleep-onset rapid eyes movement period across 4 successive tests; the average sleep latency was under 8 minutes, and the rapid eyes movement latency was under 7 minutes. Lesion of glioma in hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe was confirmed through magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and histological examination. After surgical removal of the glioma from the hippocampus area of the right anteromedial temporal lobe, the patient's EDS symptoms disappeared immediately. He scored 3 on the Epworth sleepiness scale. During our follow-up three months later, he remained well with no complications.	We diagnosed the patient with narcolepsy type 2 according to the 3rd Edition of International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3).	The patient suffered from EDS and was diagnosed with narcolepsy type 2. The narcolepsy type 2 was linked to glioma of the hippocampus area.

CASE REPORT: In this report, we present a 69-year-old male patient who had been diagnosed with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia due to progressive forgetfulness in February 2013. His Mini- Mental State Examination score was 21/30, and his Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument score was 78/100, resulted from profound deficits in recent memory and abstract thinking domains. Initial brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed bilateral medial temporal lobe atrophy but was otherwise unremarkable. He presented with new-onset progressive gait disturbance 18 months after the diagnosis of AD, and mild ataxic gait and linear hyperintensity within the midline of the pons on axial T2-weighted MRI were documented. Neither extrapyramidal nor autonomic signs were observed. Ten months later, profound cerebellar signs, urinary incontinence, and mild axial rigidity consistent with the hot cross bun (HCB) sign were noted. Probable multiple system atrophy-cerebellar (MSA-C) type was finally diagnosed by the clinical and neuroimaging features. Of note, his diagnoses of AD and HCB sign predated the diagnosis of MSA-C by 28 and 10 months, respectively. CONCLUSION: Given that the HCB sign rarely predates overt symptoms or a diagnosis of MSA, we hypothesized that the preexisting amyloidopathy and tauopathy exerted additional neurotoxicity on the synucleinopathy.

1165,11978162,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Probable metabolic interaction of doxifluridine with phenytoin.,"To report the marked elevation of the serum phenytoin concentration during treatment with antineoplastic agents.	A 51-year-old Japanese woman, who was diagnosed with multiple brain metastatic tumors, was placed on oral phenytoin at a maintenance dose of 200 mg/d (3.8 mg/kg/d) to prevent seizures. The serum concentration of phenytoin was well controlled within the therapeutic range; no seizures occurred. Four months later, combination therapy with doxifluridine (5'-DFUR) 800 mg/d, cyclophosphamide 100 mg/d, and medroxyprogesterone acetate 800 mg/d was initiated because of further metastasis. Approximately 1 month after the start of concurrent treatment with the antineoplastic agents, the serum phenytoin concentration was elevated to fourfold of the original concentration. Staggering was observed at that time, but toxic symptoms gradually subsided with the decline in the serum phenytoin concentration after its withdrawal.	A probable explanation for the marked elevation of serum phenytoin concentration is a reduction of the capacity of CYP2C-dependent phenytoin metabolism, and the antineoplastic agents could be involved in this event. The interaction of fluorouracil and phenytoin is known in clinical practice, and it is reported that the expression of hepatic CYP2C enzymes is depressed by exposure of rats to fluorouracil. 5'-DFUR, a prodrug of fluorouracil, was considered the likeliest candidate responsible for the interaction. This interaction was of clinical significance because of the great extent of changes in the serum phenytoin concentration.

She was diagnosed as having NIDDM one year ago and was treated with diet and glibenclamide (1.25 mg/day) for 6 months. However, she stopped her medical treatment one month ago and then polydipsia and general fatigue were manifested. She was admitted to a hospital five days ago at which time hyperglycemia (405 mg/dl) and anemia (Hb8.0g/dl) were detected. She was transferred to our hospital for control of blood glucose and further examination of bitemporal hemianopsia. She showed typical acromegalic features including enlargement of the nose, lips and tongue, increased heel pad and acral growth. Conscious disturbance was cured by the infusion of saline and the administration of insulin. Endoscopy revealed an active gastric ulcer (A1). Endocrine data disclosed increased GH levels in plasma and urine, whereas plasma IGF-1 levels were low. Plasma GH paradoxically increased following the administration of TRH. A water deprivation test showed an impaired increase in urinary osmolarity, indicating partial central diabetes insipidus (DI). MRI with Gd-contrast revealed a macroadenoma which progressed toward suprasella. She was diagnosed as having acromegaly, partial DI and probable hyperosmolar hyperglycemic nonketotic diabetic pre-coma. Polyuria (5-101/day) due to partial DI was controlled by the administration of DDAVP (10 micrograms/day). The constant subcutaneous administration of octreotide (240 micrograms/day) resulted in normal plasma GH levels and a marked shrinkage of the pituitary tumor. The pituitary tumor was finally removed by the transsphenoidal approach following treatment with octreotide for 4 months. HE staining of the pituitary tumor showed atrophic and acidophilic cells surrounded by hyaloid connective tissue. After the surgery, plasma GH levels were normalized and complications were cured. In conclusion, this is a very rare case of acromegaly associated with diabetic pre-coma and partial DI, and effectively treated with constant subcutaneous infusion of octreotide.",,Human-case-report,4,0

Two years later the same authors described its association with chromosome 19; nonetheless, the mutations in gene Notch3 were not described until 1996. Clinical findings depend on the age at onset. The early form of the illness is found in young patients, generally less than 30 years old, and the main clinical manifestation is a migraine headache with subcortical lesions in the white matter, while in the later form ischemic events and behavioral symptoms are predominant. Anatomo-pathological findings in CADASIL include the presence of osmophilic granular deposits in vessel walls, skin, muscles and cerebral arteries. We present a patient with CADASIL and cavernous angioma. We studied a 40-year-old woman who underwent surgery for a left temporal-parietal cavernous angioma, with aphasia as the only symptom, two years before admission. Her family history showed that her father had suffered from vascular dementia. She was admitted to our hospital with right-side hemiparesis and dysarthria. A CT scan showed the presence of ischemic vascular lesions and former surgery sequelae. The duplex scan of the neck vessels and a transesophageal echocardiogram ruled out an embolic source. Laboratory tests including VDRL, HIV, prothrombotic profile and rheumatologic screening tests were normal. An MRI in T2W and FLAIR showed the presence of multiple subcortical cerebral lesions and hyperintensity in the white matter (leukoencephalopaty). We found a left acute putaminal-capsular infarct in the diffusion-MRI. The MRA was normal. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid was unremarkable. A molecular DNA test was performed, and a nucleotide substitution in position 583 in exon 4 of gene Notch3 was detected. This mutation was found only in CADASIL patients.

Despite the previous notion of procholinergic drugs potentially inducing depression, the contemporary evidence for cholinesterase inhibitors appears to also indicate a trend for elevated mood (in patients with or without a history of depressive disorder). METHOD: Case report. RESULTS: The authors report a case of a manic episode with psychotic features associated with the up-titration of donepezil in a patient with Alzheimer's disease and a distant history of major depression but without a preexisting bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION: Pathophysiology of donepezil-induced mania appears to contradict the traditional cholinergic-adrenergic hypothesis. Donepezil-associated mania should be suspected after donepezil initiation/dose up-titration when correlated to new onset of mania. Donepezil should be used more cautiously in patients with current or previous mood episodes or in those who are otherwise at high risk for manic episodes (e.g., cerebrovascular disease). Although this requires further investigation in different patient populations, there may be subtypes of older patients with neurocognitive disorders who are particularly vulnerable to activation effects of cholinesterase inhibitors.",Cholinesterase inhibitors| Dementia| Donepezil| Mania| Neurocognitive disorders,Human-case-report,4,0

Given the similarities between the symptoms of DLB and non-DLB Alzheimer disease (AD) and related dementias, patients can sometimes be misdiagnosed with AD. To increase the sensitivity of current DLB guidelines, the DLB Consortium published its fourth revised report in 2017 with increased diagnostic weight given to dopamine transporter (DAT) uptake in the basal ganglia, demonstrated by single-photon emission computed tomography or positron emission tomography imaging. We aimed to describe the role of DAT scans in evaluating dopamine deficiency in patients with overlapping symptoms of AD and DLB. CASE REPORT We present case studies of 3 patients with memory impairment who had a diagnosis of probable AD and were being treated with cholinesterase inhibitors. During treatment, dopamine deficiency was suspected and DAT scans were performed. All 3 patients revealed severe DAT deficits in the bilateral corpus striatum. These results were consistent with probable DLB as per the current revised DLB Consortium report. All patients received treatment with carbidopa/levodopa and demonstrated improved overall function. CONCLUSIONS All 3 of our cases demonstrated the role of DAT scans in evaluating dopamine deficiency syndromes in patients with overlapping symptoms of neurocognitive disorders. Thus, a DAT scan is critical for establishing an earlier and more definitive diagnosis of DLB, which provides treatment options for dopamine replacement. It also assists providers with prognostication of dopamine deficiency syndromes and is therefore beneficial in counseling patients and caregivers.",,Human-case-report,4,0

1197,33228586,BMC psychiatry,Late-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as a differential diagnosis of dementia: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Although adult attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder has recently gained increased attention, few reports on attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the pre-elderly or elderly have been published. Here, we present the case of a patient with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who gradually developed dementia-like symptoms as she aged, which initially made her condition difficult to distinguish from early onset Alzheimer's disease. This report illustrates that some types of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be misdiagnosed as dementia. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient was a 58-year-old woman. Although she presented with a tendency for inattentiveness and forgetfulness since childhood, she did not have a history of psychiatric disorders prior to consultation. Around the age of 52 years, her inattentiveness and forgetfulness gradually progressed, and at 57 years of age, she became inattentive and forgetful that it interfered with her work and daily life. For example, she forgot meetings with important clients and transferred money to the wrong bank account; these failures resulted in poor management of her company. At home, she experienced increasing difficulties with remembering prior commitments with her family and misplacing items, which her family members noticed. With the encouragement of her family and employees, who worried that she was suffering from dementia, she visited our memory clinic, whereby she was suspected of having early onset Alzheimer's disease. However, neuropsychological tests and brain imaging evaluations did not reveal any significant abnormalities. After dismissing various possible diagnoses, including dementia, other organic diseases, mood disorders, and delirium, we diagnosed her with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Treatment with 18 mg of methylphenidate was initiated, and significant improvements in her symptoms were observed within a few days; for example, she stopped losing her things, was able to concentrate for long durations, and could complete more tasks than she could before treatment. Since initiating treatment, she has returned to work and has been able to perform her daily activities without difficulty. CONCLUSIONS: This case supports that some patients with late-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may gradually develop dementia-like symptoms during the pre-elderly and elderly stages of life. Therefore, clinicians should consider late-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder as a differential diagnosis of some types of dementias.",Dementia| Early onset Alzheimer’s disease| Late-onset attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder| Pre-elderly,Human-case-report,4,0

1200,28566233,Molecular genetics and metabolism,Expanding the genetic cause of multiple sulfatase deficiency: A novel SUMF1 variant in a patient displaying a severe late infantile form of the disease.,"Multiple sulfatase deficiency (MSD) is a rare inherited metabolic disease caused by defective cellular sulfatases. Activity of sulfatases depends on post-translational modification catalyzed by formylglycine-generating enzyme (FGE), encoded by the SUMF1 gene. SUMF1 pathologic variants cause MSD, a syndrome presenting with a complex phenotype. We describe the first Polish patient with MSD caused by a yet undescribed pathologic variant c.337G>A [p.Glu113Lys] (i.e. p.E113K) in heterozygous combination with the known deletion allele c.519+5_519+8del [p.Ala149_Ala173del]. The clinical picture of the patient initially suggested late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy, with developmental delay followed by regression of visual, hearing and motor abilities as the most apparent clinical symptoms. Transient signs of ichthyosis and minor dysmorphic features guided the laboratory workup towards MSD. Since MSD is a rare disease and there is a variable clinical spectrum, we thoroughly describe the clinical outcome of our patient. The FGE-E113K variant, expressed in cell culture, correctly localized to the endoplasmic reticulum but was retained intracellularly in contrast to the wild type FGE. Analysis of FGE-mediated activation of steroid sulfatase in immortalized MSD cells revealed that FGE-E113K exhibited only approx. 15% of the activity of wild type FGE. Based on the crystal structure we predict that the exchange of glutamate-113 against lysine should induce a strong destabilization of the secondary structure, possibly affecting the folding for correct disulfide bridging between C235-C346 as well as distortion of the active site groove that could affect both the intracellular stability as well as the activity of FGE. Thus, the novel variant of the SUMF1 gene obviously results in functionally impaired FGE protein leading to a severe late infantile type of MSD.",Formylglycine generating enzyme| Ichthyosis| Multiple sulfatase deficiency| SUMF1| Sulfatase,Human-case-report,4,0

Choroideremia has been mapped to Xq13-21 by tight linkage to restriction fragment length polymorphism loci. We have recently identified two families in which choroideremia is inherited with mental retardation and deafness. In family XL-62, an interstitial deletion in Xq21 is visible by cytogenetic analysis and two linked anonymous DNA markers, DXYS1 and DXS72, are deleted. In the second family, XL-45, an interstitial deletion was suspected on phenotypic grounds but could not be confirmed by high-resolution cytogenetic analysis. We used phenol-enhanced reassociation of 48,XXXX DNA in competition with excess XL-45 DNA to generate a library of cloned DNA enriched for sequences that might be deleted in XL-45. Two of the first 83 sequences characterized from the library were found to be deleted in probands from family XL-45 as well as from family XL-62. Isolation of these sequences proves that XL-45 does contain a submicroscopic deletion and provides a starting point for identifying overlapping genomic sequences that span the XL-45 deletion. Each overlapping sequence will be studied to identify exons from the choroideremia locus.",,Human-case-report,4,0

Most of these tumors are mitotically low in activity in accord with their benign clinical course. However, increased mitotic activity has been noted in several cases, one of which had an ultimately fatal outcome. Here, the authors present a tumor showing angiocentric glioma and glioblastoma-like features, with recurrence of the lower-grade component after radiotherapy. A 15-year-old boy presented with a 3-month history of progressive left-sided weakness and headache. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large heterogeneous mass in the right frontal lobe, with mild post-Gd enhancement. A gross-total resection was obtained. Histopathological examination of the resected tissue revealed a tumor with 2 distinct appearances: 1) a mildly to moderately cellular infiltrating tumor with angiocentric glioma characteristics, and 2) a markedly cellular glioblastoma-like tissue with necrosis and microvascular proliferation. The patient received a course of postoperative radiotherapy to 59.4 Gy in 33 fractions administered over the course of 6.5 weeks, but his tumor recurred 4 months after resection. A second resection was then performed. The recurrent tumor exhibited radiation-induced changes and persistent characteristics of angiocentric glioma, but it had fewer malignant features; the mitotic activity was lower, and there was no necrosis or microvascular proliferation. The findings in this case, along with those in several previously reported cases, suggest that angiocentric gliomas may have a malignant variant or malignant transformation. Angiocentric gliomas with malignant features tend to recur, for which surgical intervention followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy should be offered as a therapeutic option.",,Human-case-report,4,0

This disease is associated with antisocial behavior, impulse control disorder and cognitive and personality impairment, which are often the earliest manifestations of the bvFTD. One of the antisocial behaviors possibly associated with this neurodegenerative disease is pathological stealing. This case report is about a 50-year-old Italian man who had a regular life until 2010. In 2010 and 2011, some critical events occurred: he lost his job, his father-in-law, to whom he was particularly close, died, and his wife had a serious illness. He began to show symptoms of depression, a significant weight loss, apathy, poor self-care, and lack of interest in the activities of his family. He became disengaged from his prior activities, emotionally detached from his family and developed compulsive hoarding. Moreover, he had uninhibited behaviors, a memory retrieval deficit, executive dysfunctions and impulsive behaviors. In January 2012, the subject began stealing objects, particularly components of computer, without premeditation or concern for resulting legal actions. He was then diagnosed affected by bvFTD. He was charged with theft and attempted theft and the Court asked for a psychiatric evaluation, in order to analyze the effect of the neurodegenerative disease on his behavior. To answer to the Court, the Authors analyzed his history of life and made a mental examination. The subject was considered mentally insane at the time of his crimes. This is an example of the practical application in judicial cases of the latest knowledge and evidence in the literature about the frontotemporal dementia, a disease associated with antisocial behaviors that could create tensions with the criminal law. The focus of the paper is to explain how the behavioral symptoms of bvFTD can have legal implications and how to deal with legal aspects of the behaviors induced by a neuro-psychiatric condition, such as bvFTD.",Antisocial behavior| Frontotemporal dementia| Pathological stealing,Human-case-report,4,0

1221,25367666,Psychiatrike = Psychiatriki,Pharmacoresistant partial-onset epilepsy misdiagnosed as panic disorder: a case report,"The clinical differentiation between simple partial epileptic seizures of temporal lobe origin and panic attacks is often difficult on clinical grounds alone, because both conditions are characterized by common symptomatology which includes the feeling of fear, autonomic system dysfunction, disorientation and alternation of the level of consciousness when these conditions evolve clinically. The symptoms stem from common pathophysiologic and anatomic substrates of these two conditions, localized in the limbic system, especially the amygdala. We present the case of a young woman who had a febrile seizure in childhood and subsequent episodes of fear accompanied by tremor and possible alteration of consciousness followed by headache. These spells were diagnosed as panic attacks during her teenage years and she was given Clobazam in order to suppress them. The patient responded well for several years without attacks but her symptoms reappeared following discontinuation of her medication in order to conceive. At that time a detailed history was taken from her spouse and further clinical evaluation raised the suspicion of seizures especially due to the fact that her spells were characterized by alteration of consciousness; she was therefore referred for additional investigations which included admission to a monitoring unit for epilepsy. Long-term video-EEG recording revealed the presence of simple partial seizures with secondary generalization confirming the clinical impression. She was subsequently treated with antiepileptic medications; however the patient's condition worsened to the point where she became pharmacoresistant having failed several antiepileptic drug trials in monotherapy or combination. An MRI scan of the brain revealed the presence of right-sided mesial temporal sclerosis, a known consequence of febrile seizures. Her seizures were nocturnal tonic-clonic and gradually worsened to the point of occurring during most nights. She was therefore referred for a presurgical evaluation which confirmed that the epileptic focus was associated with the area of mesial temporal sclerosis. The epileptic focus was successfully removed from the right anterior temporal lobe and since then she remained free of seizures whereas, in addition, the presumed symptoms of panic attacks also resolved. This case indicates the occasional difficulty in diagnosing simple partial seizures and how it may be confused with psychiatric conditions. Therefore, the treating physician, especially the psychiatrist, should remain vigilant when treating cases of panic attacks, especially when they present with either atypical symptomatology, such as the case described, or when they do not respond to appropriately chosen treatment; such cases may warrant referral for further investigation.",,Human-case-report,4,0

However, growing evidence indicates that schizoaffective disorder (SAD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) play roles in the processes of frontotemporal atrophy and cognitive decline. Few cases of frontotemporal atrophy and impaired cognition have been reported in young adult patients with SAD and T2DM. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 34-year-old man was admitted for his 19th rehospitalization due to auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs), delusions of persecution, mania, and fluctuating blood sugar levels. After admission, a brain computed tomography (CT) scan revealed that the patient's frontotemporal atrophy, which was first found in 2014, had gradually degenerated over time. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) revealed cognitive impairments. Based on the clinical assessment, his cognition and social function impairments were determined to mainly result from SAD and T2DM because the clinical characteristics and course of the disease did not coincide with the features of progressive aggravation of dementia. DIAGNOSES: Diagnoses include the following: SAD-mania and T2DM. INTERVENTIONS: Paliperidone and sodium valproate coupled with quetiapine add-on treatment were prescribed for the patient. OUTCOMES: The therapeutic strategy had a limited effect on the patient. LESSONS: Early onset of SAD and T2DM, as well as irregular treatment, resulting in brain atrophy coupled with cognitive impairments, may be the main causes of the patient's treatment resistance and poor outcome. The risks and benefits of treatment strategies should be individually assessed.

1227,32594193,Experimental brain research,Dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in Parkinson's disease.,"Dopaminergic deficiency in Parkinson's disease (PD) has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions. In these patients, awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed. However, delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements, as in Tourette's, and in patients with functional movement disorders. Hence, the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear. 36 PD patients were tested ON and OFF dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy age-matched controls. In addition, 17 PD patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation (DBS) were tested ON medication and ON and OFF stimulation. Participants judged either the moment a self-generated action was performed, or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt, using the 'Libet method'. Temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated PD patients and controls. Dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in PD patients, relative to an unmedicated condition. The difference between ON/OFF DBS was not statistically reliable. Functional improvement of motor ability in PD through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention, and of voluntary action.",Action awareness| Dopamine| Intention awareness| Libet| Parkinson’s disease,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

1229,8895943,Pharmacopsychiatry,Low plasma thyroid indices of depressed patients are attenuated by antidepressant drugs and influence treatment outcome.,"Decreased turnover of thyroid indices and blunting of TSH release after TRH administration has been associated with depressive disorder. A further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone; during antidepressant treatment has been reported. However, the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices' concentration and response has not been addressed. In the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a four-week double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin; their plasma thyroid hormone indices (total thyroxine [TT4], free thyroxine [FT4], total triiodothyronine [TT3], free triiodothyronine [FT3], thyrotropin [TSH], and thyroglobulin [TBG]) were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment. Depressed patients' plasma TSH, when corrected for age, was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects. During antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma TT4 and FT4 concentrations. Responders showed a significant drop in TT4 FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG, but nonresponders only a decrease in FT4. During mianserin treatment, a decrease was observed in TT4, FT4, FT3, and T4/TBG. FT4 and FT3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the Hamilton Depression Rating Score (HDRS). These findings show that depressed inpatients' serum TSH levels are within the reference range, but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects, and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders. Therefore, we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression, an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressant-provoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

METHODS: Subjects were 16 chronic schizophrenia patients who underwent intranasal oxytocin treatment for 3 months and were assessed for changes in severity of clinical symptoms and cognitions. Fifteen of the 16 subjects underwent 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Oxytocin significantly reduced scores on the positive and negative syndrome scale, especially on the negative symptoms. As for cognition, there was an improvement of the verbal fluency. Furthermore, the change of the negative score in positive and negative syndrome scale showed a negative correlation with the gray matter volumes of the right insula and left cingulate cortex.

An open-label, conversion study was conducted, consisting of a 2-week LTG-IR Baseline Phase, followed by a 2-week LTG-XR Treatment Phase and a 1-week LTG-IR Phase. Forty-four subjects (> or =13 years of age) were enrolled and grouped as metabolically neutral (15), induced (15), or inhibited (14) based on the effects of the concomitant antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) on the clearance of LTG. The primary outcome was LTG PK parameters upon conversion. Secondary outcomes included seizure frequency, adverse events, and subject's preference.	LTG-XR and LTG-IR regimens were similar with respect to area under curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC (0-24)), apart from the induced group, where the AUC (0-24) of LTG-XR was on average 21% lower than for LTG-IR. A reduction in the LTG Cmax was observed for LTG-XR compared to LTG-IR resulting in a decrease in the peak-to-trough fluctuation in serum LTG concentrations. The steady-state, dose-normalized, trough concentrations for LTG-XR were similar to those of LTG-IR. The median time to peak concentration (Tmax) following administration of LTG-XR ranged from 4 to 6 h, 6 to 10 h, and 9 to 11 h in the induced, neutral, and inhibited groups, respectively. In comparison, the median Tmax following administration of LTG-IR was between 1 and 1.5 h.	Trough concentrations of LTG can be maintained on conversion from twice-daily LTG-IR to once-daily LTG-XR at the same total daily dose.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1232,14605324,Stroke,Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use is associated with reduced plasma concentration of C-reactive protein in patients with first-ever ischemic stroke.,"High levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular events in ischemic stroke. It has been hypothesized that the benefit of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients at high vascular risk may also result from their anti-inflammatory action. Data evaluating this hypothesis are limited in ischemic stroke.	We conducted a prospective observational study in 507 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke to analyze the effect of ACE inhibitor treatment at the time of stroke onset on CRP levels within the first 24 hours and the relationship to outcome. Risk estimates were calculated according to Cox regression analysis controlled for blood pressure (BP) levels, clinical and neuroradiological confounding variables, and log-normalized CRP levels at entry.	ACE inhibitor treatment was associated with lower (2.6-fold; P<0.0001) median CRP levels and with a reduced 2-year cardiovascular risk (hazard ratio, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.53; P<0.0001) compared with a different BP-lowering regimen. The relationship between ACE inhibitor status and log-normalized CRP levels remained significant (P<0.0001) after we controlled for important confounding variables and concomitant treatments. The reduced risk was also evident in multivariable analysis when ACE inhibitor treatment was controlled for BP, associated risk factors, neuroradiological findings, and concomitant treatments (hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.30 to 0.62; P<0.0001). This risk reduction was greatly attenuated and not more significant when log-normalized CRP levels were included (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.43 to 1.04; P=0.0721) in the model.	Concomitant treatment with ACE inhibitor at the time of an acute stroke is associated with lower inflammatory response and better long-term outcomes, apparently apart from the effects on BP.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This retrospective cohort study included patients who were medically admitted for pneumonia to a 2,059-bed academic medical center or its associated health system hospital. Medical records of 872 admissions from November 1, 2016 to December 15, 2018, were included for all adults with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or bipolar disorder prescribed clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, or risperidone prior to admission.	There was no significantly increased risk of pneumonia for patients taking olanzapine (odds ratio [OR] = 1.08, 95% CI, 0.48-2.41) or quetiapine (OR = 0.97, 95% CI, 0.42-2.25) prior to admission compared to risperidone. When controlling for various factors, treatment with a combination of antipsychotics including clozapine (OR = 2.28, 95% CI, 1.13-4.62, P = .022) and clozapine alone (OR = 2.37, 95% CI, 1.30-4.32, P = .005) was associated with an increased risk of pneumonia-related hospitalization compared to treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or quetiapine alone.	The findings of this study in combination with other published literature support an association of an increased risk of pneumonia with the use of clozapine, although this cannot be interpreted as causal. These data show that use of clozapine alone or in combination with other antipsychotics significantly increases risk of pneumonia, although this finding cannot be deemed causal due to study design.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A review of medical records was carried out to detect BRV administration in SE patients treated in Frankfurt and Greifswald during the period February 2016 to January 2017. The primary outcome question concerned SE resolution after BRV initiation.	During that period, BRV was started with eleven adult patients with SE. Five of these were female, and the median age was 64 (interquartile range [IQR] 21years). The median SE duration before BRV initiation was 5days (IQR 9days); the median number of previous anticonvulsants used was 4 (IQR 5). Initial BRV doses ranged between 50mg and 400mg (median 100mg), titrated to a daily dose of 100 to 400mg (median 200mg). There was a cessation of SE in the first 24h of BRV in three patients (27%). While taking BRV, no serious side effects were seen.	Based on these cases and previous data from animal experiments, BRV may prove useful in SE treatment, and trials would be warranted to examine BRV's efficacy in treating SE and how this efficacy might be influenced by co-administration with levetiracetam.",Brivaracetam| Epilepsy| SV2A| Seizure| Status epilepticus,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1235,3283314,The Journal of pediatrics,Renal failure in sick hypertensive premature infants receiving captopril therapy.,"A retrospective study of nine sick premature infants with chronic lung disease who received captopril for control of systemic hypertension (systolic blood pressure (BP) greater than 113 mm Hg) was carried out to determine efficacy of therapy and associated complications. All nine infants had markedly elevated peripheral renin values, 134.3 +/- 128.1 ng/mL/hr (mean +/- SD). Five infants had abnormal renal sonographic and perfusion scans with evidence of renal artery thrombosis, parenchymal disease, or both. Captopril therapy (0.3 mg/kg) was instituted at a postnatal age of 123 +/- 108 days. After the initial dose, the systolic BP decreased significantly in all infants, the decrease ranging from 21% to 58% of the pretreatment value. Dosage was subsequently halved in all infants. Seventeen episodes of unpredictable decreases in BP more than 40% from baseline occurred during the reduced maintenance therapy. Four infants had a total of seven episodes during which the BP decreased by 57 +/- 10% from baseline; this decrease persisted for 17 +/- 6 hours and was unresponsive to volume reexpansion and inotropic therapy. All seven episodes were accompanied by oliguria (urine output less than 1 mL/kg/hr) that persisted for 18 +/- 12 hours. These episodes were accompanied by neurologic signs (subtle seizures, lethargy, and/or apnea) within 18 +/- 6 hours after the onset of oliguria. The remaining five infants had a total of 13 episodes of decreased BP of 50 +/- 8% of baseline, which were of significantly shorter duration and responded to volume reexpanders, inotropic therapy, or both and were unaccompanied by oliguria. These data suggest the need for close observation of BP in infants receiving maintenance captopril therapy.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1236,16038683,Biological psychiatry,Emotional dysregulation in adult ADHD and response to atomoxetine.,"Before 1980, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was called minimal brain dysfunction and included emotional symptoms now listed as 'associated features' in DSM-IV. Data from two multicenter, placebo-controlled studies with 536 patients were reexamined to assess: 1) the pervasiveness of these symptoms in samples of adults with ADHD; 2) the response of these symptoms to atomoxetine; and 3) their association with depressive/anxiety symptoms.	The Wender-Reimherr Adult Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (WRAADDS) was used to assess temper, affective lability, and emotional overreactivity, thus identifying patients exhibiting 'emotional dysregulation.' Other DSM-IV Axis I diagnoses were exclusionary. Outcome measures were the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale (CAARS) and the WRAADDS.	Thirty-two percent of the sample met post hoc criteria for emotional dysregulation and had higher baseline scores on ADHD measures, a lower response to placebo, and greater response to atomoxetine (p = .048). Symptoms of emotional dysregulation had a treatment effect (p < .001) at least as large as the CAARS (p = .002) and the total WRAADDS (p = .001). Emotional dysregulation was present in the absence of anxiety or depressive diagnosis.

In addition to the substantial decline in IPD, increased disease due to nonvaccine serotypes and a changing clinical presentation emerged. The objective of this study is to describe these trends in IPD in the late PCV7-era.	We report on continued, prospective, population-based surveillance of childhood IPD in Massachusetts children during the period 2007 to 2009 and make comparisons with the earlier 2001 to 2006 PCV7-era. Demographic and clinical data were collected for all cases. Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates from normally sterile sites were serotyped and further evaluated using antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing and eBURST analysis. IPD incidence rates are calculated by age, year and serotype.	There were 326 cases of IPD between 2007 and 2009 in children < 18 years of age. Overall IPD incidence rate was 7.5 cases per 100,000 population and was not statistically different from the observed incidence in 2001 to 2006 (P > 0.05). As compared with the earlier period, the proportion of bacteremic pneumonia among all IPD cases was almost 3-fold greater in 2009 to 2010 (P < 0.01). PCV7 serotypes accounted for 7%, whereas the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes accounted for 77% of all cases between 2007 and 2009. IPD due to serotypes 19A and 7F increased, and 19A and 7F were isolated in 41% and 20% of all IPD cases in the same period, respectively. Serotype 19A also comprised a majority of the penicillin- and ceftriaxone-resistant isolates. Analysis of multilocus sequence typing data showed a significant increase in ST191, ST695 and ST320 and a significant decrease in ST199 and ST180.	The reduction in IPD after introduction of PCV7 persists in Massachusetts children; however, serotypes causing IPD have changed significantly in the last decade. Continued surveillance is necessary to determine the impact of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, as well as track potential changes in disease incidence and character due to non-13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine serotypes.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1238,15642876,Archives of internal medicine,Statin use and survival outcomes in elderly patients with heart failure.,"Coronary artery disease is a leading cause of heart failure. Statins are efficacious drugs for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but their value in persons with heart failure remains unknown.	We performed a population-based retrospective cohort study involving the entire province of Ontario, Canada, restricting participants to those aged 66 to 85 years who were free of cancer and who survived at least 90 days following hospitalization for newly diagnosed heart failure. The primary study outcome was the risk of death from all causes, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke among persons newly dispensed statins (n = 1,146) relative to those who were not (n = 27,682).	The mean age of all participants was 76.5 years, and half were women. During the 7-year study period, death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke occurred in 217 statin recipients (13.6 per 100 person-years) vs 12,299 nonrecipients (21.8 per 100 person-years; adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.63-0.83). Most of the benefit from statins was related to a reduction in all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.78). No significant reduction was seen for subsequent myocardial infarction (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.63-1.03) or stroke (adjusted HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.53-1.25).	Statin use is associated with a lower risk of death among seniors newly diagnosed as having congestive heart failure. While statin use has been previously shown to be efficacious in patients with coronary heart disease and stroke, we could not control for all prognostic risk factors in the present study, including left ventricular ejection fraction and serum lipid levels. Better evidence can direct clinicians about which patients with heart failure might benefit from these drugs.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

While the core symptoms of ADHD were according ADHD-DSM-IV diminished after 2 months, the improvement of WFIRS-P parameters required the longer duration of medical treatment. Only after 4 months of treatment, the improvement was achieved in selfesteem and social activities, and after 6 months in learning and behavior at school as well as in the level of life skills along with the decrease of risky activities.

This retrospective chart review included veterans who had an active order of lithium during their non-psychiatric or psychiatric inpatient stay over the time period of January 2000 to September 2011. Chi-square tests were used for data analysis. Frequency of appropriate lithium monitoring was assessed using standards set by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines for bipolar disorder.	A total of 200 patients (100 for each group) were included in the final analysis. Psychiatric inpatients had more frequent serum lithium levels measured during inpatient stay (p = 0.0002), whereas nonpsychiatric patients had more frequent renal monitoring (p = 0.0001). Non-psychiatric patients were significantly more likely to have action taken upon abnormal safety assessments (p = 0.0075).	Our results demonstrate significant differences between the non-psychiatric and psychiatric inpatient settings in respect to monitoring lithium. The frequency of serum lithium level monitoring in both groups was below the level set by both the National Institute for Clinical Excellence and British Association for Psychopharmacology guidelines. Additionally, frequency of corrective measures in both settings was low, indicating a need for improvement in this area.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Tenecteplase is a thrombolytic agent that offers logistical advantages in cost and administration relative to alteplase. There is evidence that tenecteplase has at least similar efficacy and safety outcomes compared with alteplase for stroke. In this study, we compared tenecteplase versus alteplase for acute stroke in a large retrospective US database (TriNetX) regarding the following 3 outcomes: (1) mortality, (2) intracranial hemorrhage, and (3) the need for acute blood transfusions.	In this retrospective study using the US cohort of 54 academic medical centers/health care organizations in the TriNetX database, we identified 3,432 patients treated with tenecteplase and 55,894 patients treated with alteplase for stroke after January 1, 2012. Propensity score matching was performed on basic demographic information and 7 previous clinical diagnostic groups, resulting in a total of 6,864 patients with acute stroke evenly matched between groups. Mortality rates, the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage, and blood transfusions (as a marker of significant blood loss) were recorded for each group over the ensuing 7- and 30-day periods. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on a cohort treated from 2021 to 2022 in an attempt to determine whether temporal differences in acute ischemic stroke treatment would alter the results.	Patients treated with tenecteplase had a significantly lower mortality rate (8.2% versus 9.8%; risk ratio [RR], 0.832) and lower risk of major bleeding as measured by the frequency of blood transfusions (0.3% versus 1.4%; RR, 0.207) than alteplase at 30 days after thrombolysis for stroke. In the larger 10-year data set of patients with stroke treated after January 1, 2012, patients receiving tenecteplase were not found to have a statistically different incidence of intracranial hemorrhage (3.5% versus 3.0%; RR, 1.185) at 30 days after the administration of the thrombolytic agents in patients. However, a subgroup analysis of 2,216 evenly matched patients with stroke treated from 2021 to 2022 demonstrated notably better survival and statistically lower rates of intracranial hemorrhage than the alteplase group.	In our large retrospective multicenter study using real-world evidence from large health care organizations, tenecteplase for the treatment of acute stroke demonstrated a lower mortality rate, decreased intracranial hemorrhage, and less significant blood loss. The favorable mortality and safety profiles observed in this large study, taken together with previous randomized controlled trial data and operational advantages in rapid dosing and cost-effectiveness, all support the preferential use of tenecteplase in patients with ischemic stroke.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Considering the limited knowledge regarding the immune mechanisms involved in narcolepsy whether related to flu vaccination or not and the recent progresses in cytokine measurement technology, we assessed 30 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors using the Luminex technology in either peripheral (serum) or central (CSF) compartments in a large population of 90 children and adult patients with narcolepsy type 1 in comparison to 58 non-hypocretin deficient hypersomniacs and 41 healthy controls. Furthermore, we compared their levels in patients with narcolepsy whether exposed to pandemic flu vaccine or not, and analyzed the effect of age, duration of disease and symptom severity. Comparison for sera biomarkers between narcolepsy (n = 84, 54 males, median age: 15.5 years old) and healthy controls (n = 41, 13 males, median age: 20 years old) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of several pro- and anti-inflammatory serum cytokines and growth factors with interferon-γ, CCL11, epidermal growth factor, and interleukin-2 receptor being independently associated with narcolepsy. Increased levels of interferon-γ, CCL11, and interleukin-12 were found when close to narcolepsy onset. After several adjustments, only one CSF biomarker differed between narcolepsy (n = 44, 26 males, median age: 15 years old) and non-hypocretin deficient hypersomnias (n = 57, 24 males, median age: 36 years old) with higher CCL 3 levels found in narcolepsy. Comparison for sera biomarkers between patients with narcolepsy who developed the disease post-pandemic flu vaccination (n = 36) to those without vaccination (n = 48) revealed an increased stimulation of the immune system with high release of three cytokines, regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted, CXCL10, and CXCL9, being independently and significantly increased in the group exposed to the vaccine. No significant differences were found between narcoleptics whether exposed to flu vaccination or not for CSF biomarkers except for a lower CXCL10 level found in the exposed group. To conclude, we highlighted the role of sera cytokine with pro-inflammatory properties and especially interferon-γ being independently associated with narcolepsy close to disease onset. The activity of the interferon-γ network was also increased in the context of narcolepsy after the pandemic flu vaccination being a potential key player in the immune mechanism that triggers narcolepsy and that coordinates the immune response necessary for resolving vaccination assaults.",Autoimmunity| Cytokine| Flu vaccination| H1N1| Hypocretin/Orexin| Interferon gamma| Narcolepsy,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We observed two PD patients with unusual buccolingual masticatory movements which did not seem to fluctuate, either throughout the day during dopaminergic treatment or during a standardised levodopa challenge. After their dopaminergic treatment had been changed to a less pulsatile form of administration (ie, the use of dopamine agonist alone in the first patient and an increase in the dosage of dopamine agonist with a low dose of levodopa in the second), these abnormal movements totally disappeared in the first patient and were greatly improved in the second. These observations suggest that levodopa can have prolonged effects (several days) and induce prolonged buccolingual masticatory movements similar in type to those classically observed with dopamine receptor antagonists (neuroleptics).",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This study investigated the association between time-varying status of statin use and incidence of PD while considering the dose-response relationship and total cholesterol level.	Using the database of the Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2002 to 2015, we examined 76,043 subjects (≥60 years old) free of PD, dementia, and stroke at baseline. The dose of statin use was classified into the following four 6-month categories (<180, 180-365, 365-540, and ≥540 days) for each 2-year interval. The incidence of PD was identified by the prescription records for any anti-PD medication with a diagnosis of PD.	During 10 years of follow-up, 1,427 PD cases occurred. Statin 'ever use' was significantly associated with a high risk of PD incidence (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.28; 95% confidence interval = 1.12-1.46) when compared with statin nonuse. In terms of a dose-response relationship, although a duration of statin use <365 days was associated with a higher risk of PD, the duration of statin use ≥365 days was not significantly associated with an increased risk of PD.	Statin use was associated with an elevated PD risk of PD, but long-term and adherent statin use was not significantly associated with elevated PD risk. However, there was no evidence of benefit with any statin treatment related to PD risk.

The study comprised 10 patients with primary enuresis and 10 normal comparable controls (age range 6-14 years). Nitrite was assayed in 'spot' morning urine samples in both the enuretics and normal controls. Enuretics were then given 50 mg indomethacin suppositories each night; urine volume, urinary osmolality and electrolytes, serum osmolality and electrolytes and urinary nitrite were assayed before indomethacin treatment and after 15 days of treatment.	The mean (sd) urinary nitrite excretion was 24.4 (19.6) micromol/L in normal children and 275.9 (111.2) micromol/L in enuretics (P<0.05). With indomethacin, the urinary nitrite concentration was significantly decreased to 141 (45.1) micromol/L (P<0.05) and associated with a significant reduction in bed-wetting episodes and voiding frequency. The functional bladder capacity was <70% of the predicted value for age in six of the patients; they had significant improvements on indomethacin, to values similar to those in patients with a nearly normal functional bladder capacity. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary volume by 41%, the night volume by 40%, clearance of free water by 46% and increased the day : night urinary volume ratio by 55%. The absolute amounts of urinary calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, urea, creatinine, and glucose were lower on indomethacin, although not statistically significantly so. Indomethacin decreased the 24-h urinary and 'spot' morning osmolality and osmotic clearance. There were no significant changes in serum osmolality and electrolyte concentrations. Indomethacin also decreased the absolute amount of urinary sodium, chloride and potassium, fractional sodium and potassium excretion, and filtered sodium. Creatinine clearance was decreased by 20% (P>0.05) and normal 24-h urinary protein was significantly lower, by 47%, after indomethacin treatment (P<0.05).	Urinary nitrite excretion increased significantly in patients with primary nocturnal enuresis; indomethacin markedly reduced bed-wetting episodes and decreased the frequency of voiding in enuretics with small or normal functional bladder capacity, which was associated with a significant decrease in urinary nitrite excretion.

1248,16453249,Pharmacopsychiatry,Transdermal rivastigmine treatment does not worsen impaired performance of complex motions in patients with Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: There is a debate about the deterioration of fine motor behavior during treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors. METHODS: We used an instrumental motor test, which demands a complex motion series. Thereby we assessed motor function in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and in controls. We also performed this task and a complex reaction time paradigm (CRT) during a six-week open-label safety study using transdermal delivery of the cholinesterase inhibitor rivastigmine. OBJECTIVES: To investigate (1) the performance of complex movements during deterioration of cognitive function and (2) the impact of rivastigmine on fine motor behavior and CRT outcomes in AD patients. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the motor test outcomes, particularly when performed with the left non-dominant hand, between controls and patients with AD and MCI. Rivastigmine did not deteriorate assessed fine motor skills and CRT results. CONCLUSION: Our study shows an impaired carrying out of complex motion series during neurodegeneration associated with cognitive dysfunction. Rivastigmine selectively inhibits the predominant cortical and hippocampal G1 cholinesterase isoform; therefore, hypothetically no deterioration of fine motor behavior appeared during transdermal rivastigmine treatment. We assume that a putative drug-induced increase in speed and attention did not offset a deterioration of motion performance because we found no significant changes in the CRT results.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1249,2517493,Hormone research,Estrogen feedback in normal and sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women.,"Feedback effect of estrogen on gonadotropin secretion was studied in normal and sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women. Twelve normoprolactinemic postmenopausal women were administered 40 micrograms/day of ethinyl estradiol (EE2) orally throughout the study. On the 4th week of the study, daily doses of 200 micrograms EE2 were also given to each subject for 4 days. Twelve postmenopausal women were given sulpiride orally in a daily dose of 150 mg throughout the study. Serum levels of prolactin were raised in all 12 subjects given sulpiride. In the 12 sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemic postmenopausal women, EE2 was given in the same manner as in normal postmenopausal women. The negative feedback effect of estrogen with low doses of EE2 (40 micrograms/day for 4 weeks) and the positive feedback effect of estrogen after the subsequent administration of EE2 (200 micrograms/day for 4 days) were demonstrated in both normoprolactinemic and hyperprolactinemic groups. The result of the present study suggests that sulpiride-induced hyperprolactinemia does not affect the negative and positive feedback effect of estrogen in postmenopausal women.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Participants were 1,019 older Catholic clergy followed up annually for up to 12 years (mean baseline age = 75.0 years, education = 18.1 years, Mini-Mental State Examination score = 28.5), enrolled in the Religious Orders Study, a longitudinal clinical-pathologic study of aging and AD. Clinical evaluations allowed for AD classification and assessment of global cognition and five cognitive domains. NSAIDs were identified by direct medication inspection at baseline and follow-up evaluations. Neuropathologic data were available on 328 deceased participants. AD pathology was summarized as a global measure and as measures of neuritic plaques, diffuse plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles. We used Cox proportional hazards models and mixed models for incident AD and cognitive decline, respectively, and logistic and linear regression for pathologic outcomes, adjusted for age, sex, and education.	Overall, we found no apparent relation of NSAIDs to incident AD (n = 209 cases), change in cognition, or AD pathology. The hazard ratio of incident AD was 1.19 (95% CI 0.87-1.62) comparing those using NSAIDs with those not using NSAIDs at baseline, and 0.84 (95% CI 0.63-1.11) for specific use of aspirin. Findings were similar in analyses in which we considered NSAID use during follow-up. NSAIDs were not related to change in cognition (all p values > 0.14). There was no relation of NSAIDs to global AD pathology or plaques or tangles.	These data do not support a strong relation between nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and Alzheimer disease or cognition. Consistent findings across clinical and pathologic outcomes provide additional confidence in these results.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

1252,31911024,The International journal on drug policy,New psychoactive substance use as a survival strategy in rural marginalised communities in Hungary.,"New psychoactive substance (NPS) use has become a widespread phenomenon among marginalised communities in Hungary. Since 2010, a growing number of reports in grey literature and anecdotal information among professionals have become available on NPS use among previously unaffected groups, such as people living in rural, socioeconomically deprived communities. In our research, we aimed to explore NPS use among these communities.	We conducted a mixed method research with convergent parallel design. Data collection took place in 2017 in marginalised communities in villages in two regions in Hungary, where 150 questionnaires were recorded and 50 interviews were conducted with current NPS users.	According to the survey results, NPS is very easy to access, synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist (SCRA) are easily bought in marginalised rural communities (79% found SCRA easy to obtain). Both SCRA and synthetic cathinones are used regularly; 57% of SCRA users and 37% of synthetic cathinone users used the respective substance at least once a week in the past 30 days. Besides NPS, sedative use (without prescription) and alcohol consumption are common among the respondents. 17% of the sample has already injected NPS. The overwhelming majority of the respondents rated regular consumption of NPS as 'very dangerous' (SCRA: 75%, synthetic cathinones 72%). NPS users have limited knowledge of consequences and the social and health treatment options available. Most themes in the interviews are associated with surviving stress, crisis and anxiety, as well as the wish to escape from insecurity and chaotic life. Positive effects of substance use (community, joy, energy) are rarely present.	People who use drugs (PWUD) living in these rural communities face the consequences of the rural risk environment: easy access to NPS, inadequate access to services, poor labour market situation and attributions of marginalised groups, for example disaffiliation. NPS use is not a recreational activity in this population; individuals mainly use NPS to get away from reality, problems, pain, poverty and marginalisation. NPS use is a survival strategy. Effective responses have to address substance use and social integration; we need complex interventions addressing structural factors.",Marginalised communities| New psychoactive substances| Risk environment| Survival strategy,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1253,7262510,Gastroenterology,The nature and prognostic significance of serial amino acid determinations in severe chronic active liver disease.,"Serum amino acid levels were determined in 29 patients with severe chronic active liver disease before, during, and after administration of prednisone or placebo and in 22 healthy controls. The pretreatment molar ratio of amino acids was less in patients than in controls (p less than 0.001) and was lower in those with cirrhosis (p less than 0.02). Branched-chain amino acid levels were elevated in patients without cirrhosis (p less than 0.02) but not in those with cirrhosis; aromatic amino acid concentrations were increased in all (p less than 0.01). The ratio improved with remission and predicted behavior after discontinuation of treatment. Patients who deteriorated failed to improve the ratio and those whose ratio improved incompletely relapsed. The ratio correlated with histologic severity and serum concentrations of albumin, bilirubin, and gamma-globulin and not with clinical manifestations of encephalopathy. We conclude that amino acid abnormalities reflect liver dysfunction and that normalization of the molar ratio may have therapeutic and prognostic significance.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A 6-month, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled trial was undertaken in 75 AD patients. Eligible patients received an initial galantamine dose of 8 mg/day and escalated over 5-8 weeks to maintenance doses of 16 or 24 mg/day. Primary efficacy measures were AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) and the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change-Plus version (CIBIC-plus). The Behavioural Pathology in AD Rating Scale (BEHAVE AD), the AD Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index were the secondary efficacy variables. Analyses were based on the intent-to-treat population. Treatment with galantamine showed significant improvement in cognition on the ADAS-cog and CIBIC-plus at month 6. Galantamine showed favourable effects on activities of daily living. Behavioural symptoms and sleep quality were also significantly improved (p < 0.05). Galantamine was well tolerated. The adverse events were mild-to-moderate intensity. The most frequent adverse events commonly reported were nausea (16.4%), dizziness (9.6%) and vomiting (6.8%). The results of this study may be consistent with galantamine being an effective and safe treatment for mild-to-moderate AD patients with or without cerebrovascular disease and VaD. Flexible dose escalation of galantamine was well tolerated. The daily maintenance dose of galantamine was 16 mg/day, followed by a back up dose of 24 mg/day.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The real-world CASSIOPEE study was thus conducted in elderly patients treated for metastatic CRC (mCRC).	This French prospective, multicenter, noninterventional study aimed to estimate 1-year progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), and describe treatments, patient autonomy (Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; Balducci scale), and safety over 24 months, in patients older than 75 with mCRC, starting first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy (NCT01555762).	From 2012 to 2014, 402 patients were included (safety population: n = 383, efficacy population: n = 358). Patient characteristics were as follows: mean age, 81 ± 4 years (<80 years, 46%; 80-85 years, 44%; >85 years, 10%); men, 52%; colon primary tumor, 80%; main metastatic site, liver 66%; Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance 0-1, 81%. Median PFS was 9.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.3-10.2). It was superior for patients ≤85 years (<80 years: 9.3 months; 80-85 years: 9.5 months) compared with patients >85 years (8.3 months). Median OS was 19.0 months (95% CI, 16.5-21.5) and decreased in the 2 oldest groups (20.6, 17.8, and 13.0 months). Autonomy assessments decreased over time leading to nonconclusive results. Twenty-six percent of patients experienced serious adverse events (SAEs): 7% bevacizumab-related SAEs, and 6% bevacizumab-targeted SAEs. Two fatal bevacizumab-related adverse events were reported (hemorrhagic stroke and intestinal ischemia).	This large French real-world study showed that medically fit older patients with mCRC could have a benefit/risk balance similar to that of younger patients when treated with first-line bevacizumab plus chemotherapy.

Indian data on use of lamotrigine is limited. This study was conducted to evaluate add-on lamotrigine in Indian children with epilepsy. Twenty children (median age 90 months) receiving lamotrigine as add-on therapy for mean 26.7 (19.1) months, were followed for a median period of 7.9 (6-10) months. Follow-up was done every two weeks. The most common seizures types were either generalized tonic-clonic (6, 30%) or myoclonic (8, 40%). The average dose used was 3.86 mg/kg/day (with concomitant valproate). Good response (>50% reduction) or complete seizure control was seen in 72% patients. Side effects were seen in 27.5% patients and were mild in more than half of these. Lamotrigine was stopped in two patients due to adverse reactions, which resolved on stopping the drug.

Subjective effects were assessed using the Profile of Mood States (POMS) before the drug was taken and 1, 3, and 6 h later. Subjects chose amphetamine a mean of 4.03 times. Compared with placebo, amphetamine produced changes in mood on the POMS including increased Vigor, Elation, Friendliness, Arousal and Positive Mood and decreased Confusion. These differences were greatest 3 hr after ingestion. Mood changes produced by d-amphetamine were comparable in all subjects regardless of the actual number of times each chose the drug. These data suggest that that subjective effects do not predict drug choice.

DESIGN: Cohort study. SETTING: The 59 recruiting sites for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). PARTICIPANTS: Outpatients with MCI and AD in ADNI. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The AD Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ). RESULTS: A total of 177 (44.0%) of 402 MCI patients and 159 (84.6%) of 188 mild-AD patients were treated with ChEIs and 11.4% of MCI patients and 45.7% of AD patients with memantine at entry. Mild-cognitive-impairment patients who received ChEIs with or without memantine were more impaired, showed greater decline in scores, and progressed to dementia sooner than patients who did not receive ChEIs. Alzheimer-disease patients who received ChEIs and memantine took them longer, were more functionally impaired, and showed greater decline on the MMSE and CDR (but not on the ADAS-cog or FAQ) than those who received ChEIs only. CONCLUSIONS: Academic physicians frequently prescribe ChEIs and memantine earlier than indicated in the US Food and Drug Administration-approved labeling to patients who are relatively more severely impaired or who are rapidly progressing toward cognitive impairment. The use of these medications in ADNI is associated with clinical decline and may affect the interpretation of clinical trial outcomes.

1259,11781860,Spinal cord,"Efficacy, safety and predictive factors of therapeutic success with sildenafil for erectile dysfunction in patients with different spinal cord injuries","STUDY DESIGN: Multicenter, open, prospective, before-after study. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of sildenafil therapy for erectile dysfunction in patients with spinal cord injury, and the association between the response to sildenafil and factors such as causes and levels of spinal cord injury, grade of ASIA deficit, time since injury, orgasmic perception, and degree of baseline erection. SETTING: Homes of outpatients of 16 spinal cord injury units in Spain. METHOD: One hundred and seventy patients with erectile dysfunction secondary to spinal cord injury, from whom baseline data were collected on their sexual function, and who started treatment with sildenafil 50 mg. An efficacy assessment was made by the patient and his partner, and the score of the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) was recorded. RESULTS: It was reported by 88.2% of the patients and 85.3% of their partners that treatment with sildenafil had improved their erections, regardless of the baseline characteristics of the spinal cord injury and erectile function. In responders, this improvement was confirmed by an increase from 12.5 to 24.8 points (P<0.001) of the Erectile Function Domain of IIEF. A significant improvement was also seen in patients' satisfaction with sexual activity and general satisfaction derived from sexual life. Preservation of orgasmic perception and a baseline degree of erection of 3 or 4 (P=0.006) were predictors of therapeutic success. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Sildenafil is an effective, well-tolerated treatment for erectile dysfunction caused by spinal cord injury, regardless of the cause, neurological level, ASIA grade, and time since injury.

However, clinical studies are conducted with specific populations that differ from the real world. The study aimed to evaluate the clinical outcomes of alectinib in real-world settings. Patients with advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and EML4-ALK fusion were enrolled from two medical centers between June 2018 and June 2020. The primary endpoints were objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free survival (PFS) to alectinib. The secondary endpoint was response of brain metastases. The risk factors for disease progression were also investigated. In total, 127 patients with advanced NSCLC were enrolled into this study. Of them, 54.3% received first-line alectinib. The 1- and 2-year PFS rates were 77.4% and 68.3%, respectively. ORR and disease control rate (DCR) were 53.5% and 91.3%, respectively. Among patients with brain metastases, intracranial ORR and DCR were 63.6% and 88.6%, respectively. In addition, we found that 'crizotinib pretreatment', 'liver metastasis' and 'TP53 co-mutation' were individually associated with shorter PFS in alectinib treatment. In conclusion, this study confirms the salient clinical outcomes of alectinib for ALK-fusion-driven NSCLC patients with or without brain metastases, adding real-world evidence to the priority of alectinib in clinical practice.",alectinib| anaplastic lymphoma kinase| nonsmall-cell lung cancer| real-world study,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

To investigate generizability of the European data set to the UK subset safety and switching data are reported here. METHODS: Patients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, symptomatically stable on antipsychotic medication, received intramuscular injections of RLAI 25 mg (to a maximum of 50 mg) every 2 weeks for 6 months. RESULTS: Of 182 UK patients enrolled, 79% had schizophrenia, 21% other psychotic disorders. Insufficient efficacy (43%), side effects (45%), and non-compliance (25%) were the most common reasons for switching. Sixty-nine per cent of patients completed the trial; 8% discontinued due to adverse events (AEs). Most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were headache (8.2%), relapse (7.7%) and insomnia (7.1%); 8 (4.4%) patients reported injection-related AEs. There were significant improvements in extrapyramidal symptom rating scale total and subscale (particularly Parkinsonism) scores, regardless of previous medication (total cohort, p < or = 0.0001). There was a small but significant increase in body weight at endpoint (1.2 kg, p = 0.0023). One patient suffered a myocardial infarction and died (not treatment-related). There were no substantial differences between the full data set and the UK sub-population CONCLUSION: Switch to RLAI was well-tolerated in stable patients over 6 months.

BACKGROUND: Migraineurs frequently report symptoms of cognitive impairment during migraine. The efficacy of sumatriptan for treatment of migraine-related cognitive impairment is undocumented. METHODS: This open-label, single-attack study of 28 subjects used the Headache Care Center-Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics, a computerized neuropsychological assessment battery, to measure cognitive function under three patient conditions: migraine-free, untreated migraine, and following sumatriptan (primary outcome). Headache response and pain-free response, percent effectiveness, and clinical disability were measured. RESULTS: Cognitive function (simple reaction time, sustained attention/concentration, working memory, visual-spatial processing) and alertness/fatigue were adversely affected during migraine compared with migraine-free performance (P<.05), and rapidly restored following sumatriptan nasal spray, 20 mg (P<.05). Headache and pain-free response were 86% and 68%, respectively, at 135 minutes postdose. Changes in migraine pain severity, clinical disability, and percent effectiveness following treatment with sumatriptan nasal spray, 20 mg, were significantly correlated with cognitive function measures across all subtests (P<.001).

There was minimal or no toxicity. Twenty of 30 patients (66%) receiving at least twice weekly poly-ICLC showed regression or stabilization of gadolinium-enhancing tumor, as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging (median = 65% volume decrease). All but one patient with anaplastic astrocytomas who received continuous poly-ICLC remain alive, with a median progression-free survival of 54 months from diagnosis. Median Kaplan-Meier survival is 19 months for patients with glioblastomas who receive at least twice weekly poly-ICLC treatments. Tumor response was associated with 2',5' -oligoadenylate synthetase activation (P = 0.03) but not with serum interferon. We hypothesize clinical activation by poly-ICLC of a basic host tumor suppressor system. Prolonged, quality survival with tumor stabilization or regression confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging for most patients with anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas suggests that more extensive laboratory and controlled clinical studies are warranted. The concept of long-term, broad spectrum stimulation of host defenses with nontoxic, inexpensive double-stranded ribonucleic acids, such as low-dose poly-ICLC, may be applicable to the treatment of other malignancies.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1265,3876688,Acta psychiatrica Belgica,Instability in the response to DST in major depressions during treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa.,"During the course of an investigation of predictors of the therapeutic response to a precursor of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptophan, 5-HTp) associated with carbidopa in major depressions with melancholia, patients, who before the treatment behaved as suppressors in the DST, became non-suppressors. The variation from non-suppressor to suppressor (which yielded in 60% of this sample) can be explained by the clinical improvement, but not the inverse change. In this paper, different possibilities on this change are analyzed, the most probable being the direct effect of the carbidopa in eminentia media. The carbidopa is administered because it is an inhibitor of the aminoacid decarboxylase, and since it does not cross the hematoencephalic barrier, it permits a better use of the 5-HTp. However, there is an exception: it does act in the cells of the eminentia media which, from the functional point of view, lie outside the above-mentioned hematoencephalic barrier.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1266,28645717,Vaccine,Surveillance of pneumococcal colonization and invasive pneumococcal disease reveals shift in prevalent carriage serotypes in Massachusetts' children to relatively low invasiveness.,"Following the introduction of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), overall nasopharyngeal colonization rates have not changed significantly, however a dramatic and sustained decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in children was observed in every setting where the PCVs were implemented. We aimed to describe the differences in invasive disease potential of serotypes that are common colonizers in pre- and post-vaccine eras in order to provide further insight in our understanding of dynamic epidemiology of pneumococcal diseases.	Using data from surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage and enhanced surveillance for IPD, a serotype specific 'invasive capacity (IC)' was computed by dividing the incidence of IPD due to serotype x by the carriage prevalence of that same serotype in children <7years of age in Massachusetts. We have evaluated the serotype specific invasive capacity in two periods; pre-PCV13 (2001/02, 2003/04, 2006/07, 2008/09) and post-PCV13 (2010/11 and 2013/14), and by age groups; <24monthsvs. ≥24months.	An approximate 50-fold variation in the point estimate was observed between the serotypes having the highest (7F, 38, 19A, 3, 33F) and the lowest (6C, 35B, 21, 11A, 23B and 23A) computed serotype specific invasive disease potential. In the post-PCV13 era (6C, 35B, 11A, 23B and 23A), 5 of the 7 most common serotypes colonizing the nasopharynx were serotypes with the lowest invasive capacity. Serotype specific invasive capacity trended down in older children for majority of the serotypes, and serotypes 3, 10A and 19A had significantly lower invasive capacity in children older than 24months of age compared to younger children.	Invasive capacity differs among serotypes and likely by age. Point estimates of IC for most of the common serotypes colonizing children in Massachusetts in post-PCV13 era were low and likely explain the continued reduction in IPD from the pre-PCV era in the absence of specific protection against these serotypes.",Carriage| Invasive disease potential| Serotype replacement,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Recently proposed criteria for remission (mild or less on multiple core-symptom ratings for at least 6 months) have been applied to a 1-year study of long-acting risperidone injection. METHODS: In a 50-week, open-label trial, stable patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder who received long-acting risperidone injection every 2 weeks were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Remission criteria for the PANSS were applied; global illness severity (Clinical Global Impressions) and patient-rated health status (36-Item Short-form Health Survey) were measured. RESULTS: Groups were identified by initial remission status (excluding the time component). Although considered clinically ""stable,"" 68.2% (394/578) did not meet the symptom-severity component of remission criteria at baseline. Following long-acting, injectable risperidone treatment, 20.8% (82) of nonremitted patients achieved symptom remission for at least 6 months, with significant decreases in mean PANSS total and cluster scores (P < 0.0001) and significantly improved patient-rated health status (P < 0.0001). Percentages rated as not ill, very mild, or mild increased from 39% to 88%. Among 31.8% (184/578) of patients meeting the symptom-severity component of remission criteria at baseline, 84.8% (156) maintained these criteria at endpoint. CONCLUSIONS: Among previously ""stable,"" nonremitted patients, many achieved symptom remission after long-acting, injectable risperidone treatment, with significant improvements in multiple symptom domains and patient-rated health status.

Our objective was to assess associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage among young adults.	We included 3415 respondents aged 18 to 29 years to the 2019-2020 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ACE and HPV vaccination modules. Adverse childhood experiences included emotional, physical, and sexual abuse; household intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and mental illness; and parental separation/divorce and incarcerated household member. We used log-binomial regression models to calculate prevalence ratios (PRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for associations between ACEs and self-reported HPV vaccination and completion. Secondary outcomes included influenza vaccination uptake, time since routine checkup, HIV testing history, and HIV-related risk behavior.	Several ACEs were positively associated with HPV vaccination initiation, including emotional abuse (PR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.17-1.43), intimate partner violence (PR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.00-1.30), substance abuse (PR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.33), and mental illness (PR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.22-1.50). Similar associations were observed for completion. Conversely, most ACEs were negatively associated with influenza vaccination (PRs from 0.72 to 1.00) and with recent checkup (PRs from 0.92 to 1.00). Adverse childhood experiences were positively associated with having had an HIV test (PRs from 1.19 to 1.56) and HIV-related risk behavior (PRs from 1.19 to 2.07).	The unexpected positive associations between ACEs and HPV vaccination coverage could be due to opportunities to receive HPV vaccination in late adolescence or early adulthood while accessing STI/HIV prevention or treatment services. Future studies should evaluate associations between ACEs and timely HPV vaccination in early adolescence.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This was a prospective observational questionnaire study using ePAQ-PF (electronic Pelvic Assessment Questionnaire-Pelvic Floor), PISQ 12 and PGI-I for overactive bladder and sexual function. Sexually active women with overactive bladder were included in the study. Prolapse and voiding dysfunction were exclusion criteria for the study. All women were followed up for 6 months and were treatment naïve. Sexual function before and after treatment was compared. The data were analysed using SPSS. Formal ethical approval was obtained.	34 women were included in the study. Only 8 % of women commenced on anticholinergics had an improvement in sexual function, compared to 66 % who experienced an improvement in OAB symptoms. Women who did experience a benefit in sexual function did so in the first 3 months of treatment of their overactive bladder and always noted an improvement in OAB symptoms.

1270,15554773,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder with phenytoin: an open-label pilot study,"BACKGROUND: Phenytoin is an anticonvulsant used in the treatment of epilepsy. Its mechanism of action is incompletely understood but most likely involves modulation of glutamatergic transmission. The neurobiology of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has been hypothesized to involve, at least in part, alterations in glutamatergic transmission in the hippocampus and possibly other brain regions. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of phenytoin on symptoms of PTSD. METHOD: Phenytoin was administered in an open-label fashion for 3 months to 9 adult male and female patients with DSM-IV PTSD related to a variety of traumas including childhood abuse, combat, and car accidents. Dosage was adjusted to maintain the therapeutic blood levels used in the treatment of epilepsy. Subjects were assessed before, during, and after treatment for PTSD with standardized dimensional measures of disease severity including the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Anxiety (HAM-A). Data were collected from November 2001 through June 2003. RESULTS: Phenytoin treatment resulted in a significant decrease in PTSD symptoms as measured with the CAPS (mean score = 65 pretreatment vs. 38 posttreatment) with reductions in each of the symptom clusters of intrusions, avoidance, and hyperarousal (p < .05). There were no significant decreases in symptoms of depression severity as measured with the HAM-D or anxiety severity as measured with the HAM-A. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that phenytoin may be efficacious in the treatment of PTSD, possibly mediated through its antiglutamatergic effects. Randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials are indicated to further evaluate this medication in the treatment of PTSD.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1271,9390696,Pediatric neurology,Intraventricular urokinase for the treatment of posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus,"This case series pilot study assessed the safety of intraventricular urokinase administration, alternating with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drainage. A secondary objective was to comment on whether this therapy achieves fibrinolysis, and whether this fibrinolysis is sufficient to prevent progression of hydrocephalus to requirement for ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Six preterm infants with progressive posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus requiring treatment with a ventricular drain received an infusion of intraventricular urokinase alternating with CSF drainage for 3 days. Of the 6 treated patients, the median gestation at birth was 26.5 weeks and the median age at treatment was 30 days. One patient had an elevation in CSF erythrocyte count most likely due to successful clot lysis. One patient had an elevated CSF leukocyte count consistent with transient meningeal irritation. No other side effects were noted. Fibrinolysis was achieved in the CSF, as documented by markedly elevated D-dimer levels. Clot size diminished ultrasonographically. However, all 6 patients eventually required a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. We conclude that intermittent infusion of intraventricular urokinase alternating with periods of CSF drainage is probably a safe way to achieve a fibrinolytic state. However, when administered at the relatively late point in the neonatal course when a ventricular drain is required, this fibrinolytic state is not sufficient to decrease the requirement for ventriculoperitoneal shunt.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1272,35164524,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,Lithium plus antipsychotics or anticonvulsants for bipolar disorder: Comparing clinical response and metabolic changes.,"Patients with bipolar disorder treated with lithium often require additional antipsychotics or anticonvulsants. However, the comparative effectiveness and safety of these agents as add-on to lithium has not been studied.	This secondary analysis combined two similar 24-week trials on outpatients with bipolar disorder randomized to lithium (target serum level 0.4-0.6 mEq/L). Guideline-based adjunctive antipsychotics (Li+AP) and anticonvulsants (Li+AC) could be used if clinically indicated and was assessed at every study visit. Response was measured on the Clinical Global Impression scale and we performed adjusted mixed effects linear regression analyses. Analysis of variance tests compared metabolic measures including a binary diagnosis of metabolic syndrome before and after 24 weeks of treatment.	Among 379 outpatients (57% female, mean age 38 years, mean Clinical Global Impression 4.4), users of Li+AP (N = 50, primarily quetiapine and aripiprazole) improved to a similar degree (mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.6, standard deviation = 1.5) as those using lithium-only (i.e. without adjunctive antipsychotics or anticonvulsants, N = 149, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.7, standard deviation = 1.4) (p = 0.59). Users of Li+AC (N = 107, primarily lamotrigine and valproate, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.2, standard deviation = 1.3) and users of Li+AP+AC (N = 73, mean Clinical Global Impression improvement = 1.1, standard deviation = 1.3) showed worse response compared to lithium-only users (all p < 0.01). When comparing Li+AP to Li+AC, users of Li+AP improved slightly better on general (p = 0.05) and manic symptoms (p = 0.01), but showed a worse development of glucose, triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome.	Despite treatment-by-indication confounding, these findings are relevant for real-world treatment settings and emphasize the need for randomized trials on this clinically important topic.",Bipolar disorder| anticonvulsant| antipsychotic| bipolar depression| lithium,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The study group comprised 29 children, 16 males and 13 females, aged 3 to 19 years, affected by partial (4) and generalized (25) crypto/symptomatic epilepsy and mental retardation (7 mild, 5 moderate, 15 severe, 2 profound), who were administered topiramate (TPM) as add-on therapy to their baseline antiepileptic treatment. At baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months, parents or caregivers of each patient were administered a questionnaire based on the Holmfrid Quality of Life Inventory. After a 3-month follow-up, the add-on topiramate caused overall mild to moderate cognitive/behavioral worsening in about 70% of children and adolescents with mental retardation and epilepsy. After 6 and 12 months of follow-up, global worsening persisted in 31 and 20.1% of cases, respectively. In conclusion, this trial confirms that TPM can have significant adverse cognitive and behavioral side effects, even in mentally disabled children and adolescents.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The aim of this observational study was to assess its effectiveness in patients with mental retardation and refractory epilepsy. Sixty-four patients were started on adjunctive LEV after a 3-month baseline. LEV was initially dosed at 250 mg daily and increased by 250 mg every 2 weeks thereafter according to clinical response. Caregivers rated the patient's sleep, appetite, alertness, and behavior as poor (1), reasonable (2), or good (3) at each clinic visit. Patients were reviewed until one of four endpoints was reached: seizure freedom for at least 6 months, > or = 50% reduction in seizure frequency (responder) over a 6-month period, <50% reduction in seizure frequency (marginal effect) over a 6-month period, or LEV withdrawal due to lack of efficacy, adverse effects, or both. Twenty-four (38%) patients became seizure-free, 10 of whom were controlled on LEV 250 mg twice daily. An additional 18 (28%) patients were classified as responders, and 8 (12%) reported only marginal benefit from adjunctive LEV. Fourteen (22%) patients discontinued LEV (6 worsening seizures, 1 lack of efficacy, 7 adverse effects).

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of sleep medications on sleep quality and delirium in acute stroke. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, sleep disturbances, and delirium were investigated in acute stroke patients treated in April 2013-March 2017 who were prescribed ramelteon plus either an alpha-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAR) agonist or a selective dual orexin receptor antagonist (suvorexant). RESULTS: Of the patients included, 104 received a GABAR agonist and 128 received suvorexant in addition to ramelteon. Patient characteristics did not differ significantly between the groups, except for a higher proportion of cerebral infarction in suvorexant group (P = .033). Subjective sleep quality was significantly improved in suvorexant group compared to GABAR agonist group (difficulty staying asleep: 6.3% versus 34%, P < .001; daytime sleepiness: 33% versus 63%, P < .001). Delirium was significantly less frequent in suvorexant group than GABAR agonist group (7.0% versus 31%, P < .001). The length of hospital stay was significantly shorter in suvorexant group than in GABAR agonist group (in days, 21 [15-29] versus 25 [18-33]; P = .019). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the addition of suvorexant was significantly associated with a reduced occurrence of delirium (odds ratios .19, 95% confidence interval .085-.43, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Addition of suvorexant to ramelteon therapy, rather than a GABA receptor agonist, can improve subjective sleep quality without inducing delirium in acute stroke patients.",Delirium| ramelteon| sleep quality| stroke| suvorexant,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A total of 271 therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) data were retrospectively collected from 127 psychiatric outpatients. A population nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach was used to describe serum concentrations of paroxetine. For 83 patients with major depressive disorder, the treatment response rate and the incidence of adverse drug reaction (ADR) were characterized by logistic regression using daily dose or area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) estimated from the final model as a potential exposure predictor.	One compartment model was developed. The apparent clearance of paroxetine was affected by age as well as daily dose administered at steady-state. Overall treatment response rate was 72%, and the incidence of ADR was 30%. The logistic regression showed that exposure predictors were not associated with treatment response or ADR in the range of dose commonly used in routine practice. However, the incidence of ADR increased with the increase of daily dose or AUC for the patients with multiple concentrations.	In depressed patients treated with paroxetine, TDM may be of limited value for individualization of treatment.",NONMEM| exposure–outcome relationship| paroxetine| population pharmacokinetics| therapeutic drug monitoring,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Participants with major depressive disorder (N = 2875) at primary and specialty care sites who received the first step treatment with citalopram in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study were included. Patients were enrolled between July 2001 and April 2004. Melancholic features were ascribed by previously developed algorithms of telephone interview ratings prior to treatment. Demographics, clinical features, and treatment response were compared between those with and without melancholic features.	The 23.5% of participants with melancholic features were characterized by higher severity scores, greater rates of previous suicide attempts and ratings of current suicidal risk, and more concurrent psychiatric comorbidity. Unadjusted remission rates for those with melancholic features were statistically significantly reduced in absolute terms by up to 8.4% compared to those without melancholic features, which is a 24.1% decrease in relative chance of remission (p < .0001). Following adjustments for between-group baseline differences, remission rates were no longer different.	Melancholic features are associated with a significantly reduced remission rate with an SSRI. This effect appears to be accounted for by demographic and clinical features associated with melancholic features.	clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT0021528.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1280,22939118,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts among former users of finasteride with persistent sexual side effects.,"Finasteride, a commonly prescribed medication for male pattern hair loss, has recently been associated with persistent sexual side effects. In addition, depression has recently been added to the product labeling of Propecia (finasteride 1 mg). Finasteride reduces the levels of several neuroactive steroids linked to sexual function and depression. This study assesses depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts in former users of finasteride who developed persistent sexual side effects despite the discontinuation of finasteride.	In 2010-2011, former users of finasteride (n = 61) with persistent sexual side effects for ≥ 3 months were administered standardized interviews that gathered demographic information, medical and psychiatric histories, and information on medication use, sexual function, and alcohol consumption. All former users were otherwise healthy men with no baseline sexual dysfunction, chronic medical conditions, current or past psychiatric conditions, or use of oral prescription medications before or during finasteride use. A control group of men (n = 29), recruited from the community, had male pattern hair loss but had never used finasteride and denied any history of psychiatric conditions or use of psychiatric medications. The primary outcomes were the prevalence of depressive symptoms and the prevalence of suicidal thoughts as determined by the Beck depression inventory II (BDI-II); all subjects self-administered this questionnaire at the time of the interview or up to 10 months later.	Rates of depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 14) were significantly higher in the former finasteride users (75%; 46/61) as compared to the controls (10%; 3/29) (P < .0001). Moderate or severe depressive symptoms (BDI-II score ≥ 20) were present in 64% (39/61) of the finasteride group and 0% of the controls. Suicidal thoughts were present in 44% (27/61) of the former finasteride users and in 3% (1/29) of the controls (P < .0001).	Clinicians and potential users of finasteride should be aware of the potential risk of depressive symptoms and suicidal thoughts.

We enrolled Japanese spinal cord injury patients with cystometrically confirmed neurogenic detrusor overactivity who experienced urinary incontinence at least once a week either because they were refractory to anticholinergics or had to discontinue treatment because of adverse events. Patients received 200 units of onabotulinumtoxinA injected into the bladder wall after a 2-week washout of anticholinergics, and urodynamic variables were assessed before and 1 month after injection. Catheterization and urinary incontinence data, as well as International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form scores, were assessed before injection and every month thereafter until the cessation of treatment effects.	The study enrolled 19 patients (13 men, six women, age range 22-67 years). One month after injection, the mean number of urinary incontinence episodes decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 times/day (P = 0.004), and the maximum cystometric capacity increased from 100 mL to 296 mL (P = 0.0004).

Data from a large study (n=725), which included schizoaffective patients to assess the effect of long-acting risperidone, are presented. METHOD: A multicenter, open-label study enrolled non-acute, clinically stable patients with schizoaffective disorder (n=110). Patients on a stable dose of antipsychotic for at least 4 weeks at study entry were switched to long-acting risperidone every 2 weeks for 50 weeks. RESULTS: Mean Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total scores (+/-S.E.) improved significantly (p<0.001) at each measured time point, including endpoint (-9.0+/-1.6), compared with baseline. Significant reductions were observed on mean PANSS cluster scores for both anxiety/depression (-1.3+/-0.4, p<0.001) and uncontrolled hostility/excitement (-0.7+/-0.3, p<0.05). In addition, scores improved significantly for positive symptoms (-2.2+/-0.5, p<0.001), negative symptoms (-3.1+/-0.5, p<0.001), and disorganized thoughts (-1.7+/-0.4, p<0.001). The overall subjective score of movement disorders was low at baseline (3.6+/-4.1) and had significantly decreased at endpoint (2.75; p<0.05). Patients were previously treated with antipsychotics for 398+/-790 days before being switched to long-acting risperidone. LIMITATIONS: Although this was a 50-week study, which included over 100 patients with schizoaffective disorder, limitations include the open-label design and that it was not designed specifically to assess patients with this disorder. PANSS symptom domains previously defined by factor analytic methods were used for mood symptom measures. No specific mood symptom scales were administered in this study.

The mechanisms underlying this association have not been fully defined.	The aim of the study was to determine whether increasing hydrocortisone (or equivalent) to 30 mg/d in ACTH-deficient patients increased cardiovascular risk and whether a reduction in insulin sensitivity and attenuation of insulin's hemodynamic effects was responsible for this effect.	We conducted an open interventional study between 2011 and 2013.	The study was performed in the Endocrine Research Unit, Repatriation General Hospital, Adelaide, Australia.	Seventeen ACTH-deficient subjects taking hydrocortisone (≤20 mg/d) for at least 6 months were studied.	Subjects were studied before and after a 7-day increase in hydrocortisone to 30 mg/d.	The primary outcome was the change in pulse wave velocity, both fasting and after a 75-g oral glucose load.	Fasting and post-glucose load pulse wave velocities were not significantly different on the higher glucocorticoid dose. Fasting augmentation index (24.9 ± 2.7 vs 22.6 ± 2.6%; P = .04) and reactive hyperemia index (2.3 ± 0.2 vs 2.0 ± 0.2; P = 0.04) were lower on the higher glucocorticoid dose, with no significant difference in the post-glucose load changes in these variables. There were no significant changes in insulin sensitivity or secretion on the higher glucocorticoid dose.	Endothelial dysfunction may contribute to the increased cardiovascular mortality associated with higher glucocorticoid doses. This may be a direct glucocorticoid effect, not mediated by insulin resistance. ACTH-deficient patients should thus be prescribed the lowest safe glucocorticoid replacement dose.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

After propensity score matching, univariate logistic and interaction analyses were performed to compare short-term (neonatal period) and medium-term (3 years of age) outcomes of the children of mothers who received antenatal corticosteroids with those of children of mothers who did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. We focused on differences between singletons and twins, between monochorionic and dichorionic twins and between the first and second twin.	The study comprised 23,502 singletons and 6,546 twins. Antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significant decreased short-term neurologic outcomes in both singletons and twins. However, antenatal corticosteroid treatment was associated with significantly decreased mortality (odds ratio [OR] 0.61; 95% CI 0.53-0.70), respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.67-0.76), and cerebral palsy (OR 0.85, 95% CI 0.72-0.99) in singletons but not in twins (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.68-1.17; OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.12; and OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.61-1.11, respectively). No association was found between chorionicity and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes. Further, no association was found between birth order and the efficacy of antenatal corticosteroid treatment on outcomes, except for periventricular leukomalacia and necrotizing enterocolitis (interaction: P=.02 and P=.04, respectively).	Antenatal corticosteroid treatment in twins was associated with a beneficial effect on short-term neurologic outcomes only, without improvement in other short-term and medium-term outcomes. There was no difference related to chorionicity.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

1291,8483066,Journal of pediatric surgery,Aminocaproic acid decreases the incidence of intracranial hemorrhage and other hemorrhagic complications of ECMO.,"Since the inception of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), hemorrhage has been a major complication often limiting its usefulness. This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of aminocaproic acid (AMICAR), an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on all hemorrhagic complications of ECMO including intracranial hemorrhage (ICH). In 1990, 49 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO therapy. None of these patients received AMICAR. In 1991, 51 neonates and 5 older children received ECMO. Forty-two of these patients who were considered to be at high risk for bleeding complications (preexisting or anticipated surgical procedures, preexisting ICH, or profound hypoxia, acidosis, coagulopathy, or prematurity) were given AMICAR. The remaining 14 low-risk neonates did not receive AMICAR, and for purposes of analysis were combined with the 1990 group. AMICAR was administered just prior to or after cannulation (100 mg/kg, intravenously) and was infused continuously at 30 mg/kg/h until decannulation. Except for the addition of AMICAR, the ECMO protocol was identical for these two patient groups. Patients who received AMICAR had significantly less bleeding while on ECMO (P = .03) and required fewer blood transfusions (P = .01) than patients not receiving AMICAR. This difference was most significant in the congenital diaphragmatic hernia and cardiac subgroups (P = .0001) and was not significant in the meconium aspiration subgroup (P = .1). The incidence of ICH in the neonatal subgroup was also significantly reduced with no patient on AMICAR developing a new or extending a preexisting ICH (P = .007). Reexploration of the cannulation site for bleeding was also reduced in the AMICAR-treated group but the difference failed to reach statistical significance.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1292,16401163,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,Open-label risperidone for Asperger's disorder: negative symptom spectrum response,"OBJECTIVE: Asperger's disorder consists of negative symptoms similar to those seen in schizophrenia, autism, schizoid personality disorder, and schizotypal personality disorder. We investigated whether risperidone, which is effective in treating the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, would improve such symptoms observed in Asperger's disorder in a prospective, open-label trial. METHOD: Thirteen male patients aged 6 to 18 years who were diagnosed with Asperger's disorder by DSM-IV criteria were enrolled in a 12-week, prospective, open-label pilot study from March 13, 2002 to August 11, 2003. All subjects were started on risperidone 0.25 mg twice per day. Doses were increased based on clinical indication and tolerability. The primary efficacy variable was the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS). Each subject's baseline score served as his control. Secondary efficacy measures included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Global Assessment Scale, and a modified Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale. RESULTS: We found a statistically significant improvement from baseline for last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) analyses as well as for analyses of 12-week completers (N = 9) in our primary outcome measure, SANS scores (F = 13.41, p < .0001 for 12-week completers; F = 9.64, p < .0001 for LOCF). We also found statistically significant improvement in all secondary efficacy measurements (F values range, 8.41 to 15.73, p values range, < .0001 to < .005 for 12-week completers; F values range, 6.53 to 7.75, all p < .0001 for LOCF). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects' symptoms significantly improved after risperidone. The open-label nature of this small pilot study suggests caution in interpreting these data, but the results suggest that placebo-controlled trials should follow.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1293,35617623,Journal of patient safety,Lessons Learned in Implementing a Chronic Opioid Therapy Management System.,"Opioid misuse has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in the United States, and safer opioid use represents an important challenge in the primary care setting. This article describes a research collaborative of health service researchers, systems engineers, and clinicians seeking to improve processes for safer chronic opioid therapy management in an academic primary care center. We present implementation results and lessons learned along with an intervention toolkit that others may consider using within their organization.	Using iterative improvement lifecycles and systems engineering principles, we developed a risk-based workflow model for patients on chronic opioids. Two key safe opioid use process metrics-percent of patients with recent opioid treatment agreements and urine drug tests-were identified, and processes to improve these measures were designed, tested, and implemented. Focus groups were conducted after the conclusion of implementation, with barriers and lessons learned identified via thematic analysis.	Initial surveys revealed a lack of knowledge regarding resources available to patients and prescribers in the primary care clinic. In addition, 18 clinicians (69%) reported largely 'inheriting' (rather than initiating) their chronic opioid therapy patients. We tracked 68 patients over a 4-year period. Although process measures improved, full adherence was not achieved for the entire population. Barriers included team structure, the evolving opioid environment, and surveillance challenges, along with disruptions resulting from the 2019 novel coronavirus.	Safe primary care opioid prescribing requires ongoing monitoring and management in a complex environment. The application of a risk-based approach is possible but requires adaptability and redundancies to be reliable.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1294,35241041,BMC endocrine disorders,Somatropin therapy in italian adults with growth hormone deficiency.,"In adult population, Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) is a complex clinical condition with heterogeneity of causes and duration. Growth Hormone (GH) replacement therapy has beneficial effects entailing a chronic and expensive use. Therefore, entity, appropriateness and standardization of GHD treatment need to be accurately analysed. In Italy, the epidemiological surveillance on somatropin therapy is entrusted to the National Register of Growth Hormone Therapy (Registro Nazionale degli Assuntori dell'Ormone della Crescita-RNAOC) by the Italian Regulation, in accordance of which the RNAOC-database is collecting the notifications of somatropin prescriptions.	Aim of this study is to analyse data on somatropin-treated adult population communicated to the RNAOC by the specialist centres of 15 Italian regions and 2 autonomous provinces.	From 2011 to 2019, the somatropin-treated adults were 970 with 4061 examinations (1.21 ± 0.33 visits/year). The diagnoses were: hypopituitarism (n = 579); hypophysectomy (n = 383); and congenital GHD (n = 3). Five subjects were addressed with diagnoses not included in the regulation. The starting posology of somatropin was 0.320 (± 0.212) mg/day, 0.292 (± 0.167) mg/day in male and 0.360 (± 0.258) in female patients, with 7 administrations/week in 70.31% of the prescriptions. The differences in posology by gender persisted at 10th year of the follow-up. Starting dosage was higher in patients diagnosed with adult GHD before the age of 30 (0.420 ± 0.225 mg/day), with a progressive decrease of the dosage during the follow-up.

Weight change was measured for 63 children and adolescents with autism treated with risperidone for 6 months. Change in serum leptin levels after 2 months was examined as a predictor of final weight gain in mixed regression models that controlled for site, gender, age, and risperidone dose.	Age- and gender-standardized weight increased after 6 months of treatment (gross: mean=5.6 kg [SD=3.9]; standardized: mean=0.6 z [SD=0.5]) and was positively correlated with weight gained after 1 month. Change in leptin levels after 2 months of treatment (mean=-0.3 ng/ml, SD=6.2) (N=48) did not predict final weight gain.	Chronic risperidone exposure in children with autism causes weight gain in excess of developmentally expected norms that follows a curvilinear trajectory and decelerates over time. Serum leptin change does not reliably predict risperidone-associated weight gain.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Much data on paracetamol toxicity originate from liver transplant centers and tertiary referral institutions. The authors analyzed the population-based annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses and ALF, and described the risk factors for hepatotoxicity.	A search was undertaken for the diagnosis of paracetamol overdoses in the diagnoses registry of the National University Hospital of Iceland from 2004 to 2009 serving a population of 219,249 inhabitants. Relevant information was collected from medical records.	A total of 1913 drug-related poisoning episodes were identified and reviewed, 352 (18%) involved paracetamol overdoses. The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses declined from 30.0 (2004) to 16.0/100,000 per year (2009) (p < 0.05). The female/male ratio was 3.0 and the largest age group was 16-25 years. After the initial examination, 26% were discharged home. Hospitalized index visits were 182 with accidental overdoses constituting 16 (9%) with no gender difference. Compared with intentional overdose the accidental group had higher aminotransferases (p < 0.005). ALF occurred in 3.8% (7/182) of the index visits and the incidence was 0.7/100,000 per year. In the intentional group, 1.2% (2/163) developed ALF versus 25% (4/16) of the accidental group (p = 0.001). Only one patient died from ALF and none underwent liver transplantation.	The annual incidence of paracetamol overdoses was high in this population-based study but declined. Young females with intentional overdose accounted for most of the cases, whereas accidental overdoses were more common in older patients. The occurrence of ALF was low and mostly associated with accidental overdose.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1298,11571062,"Addiction (Abingdon, England)",Comparison of methadone and high dosage buprenorphine users in French care centres.,"In France, maintenance programmes for opiate users were adopted later than in other countries. Two maintenance treatments are available: methadone is only delivered in specialized centres while high dosage (HD) buprenorphine can be prescribed by all general practitioners and in specialized centres. The aim of this study was to compare the socio-demographic profiles, the practices and drug consumption patterns of the two groups attending specialized centres.	The Oppidum Programme (observation of illegal drugs and misuse of psychotropic medications), a multi-centric survey, surveys drug-dependent subjects attending specialized care centres throughout France annually. Data were collected by questionnaire on socio-demographic variables and drug use during the preceding week.	During October 1998, 46 centres took part in the survey. The methadone group (n = 424) was older, with a better economic situation; 16% used cocaine regularly. The HD buprenorphine group (n = 616) consumed more heroin (12% vs. 8%) and engaged in more misuse, such as intravenous use, illicit acquisitions or irregular consumption. These practices were more frequent for patients consuming the drug 'outwith protocol' or for patients obtaining the drug from a general practitioner.	Our results suggest that patterns of consumption of methadone and buprenorphine are different in several respects: concomitant use of licit or illicit psychoactive substances, route of administration, and illegal acquisition. They also suggest that the behaviours of maintenance treatment users depend less on the nature of the maintenance drug (methadone or high dosage buprenorphine), than the nature of the delivery and monitoring practices.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A prospective, open, multicentre trial based on observation involving 324 patients between 6 and 87 years of age with partial seizures who had not received prior treatment with antiepileptic drugs (AED) (n = 114) or in whom other monotherapies had failed (n = 210). These patients were administered OXC in the conditions usually found in clinical practice over a period of 52 weeks; effectiveness was evaluated by the reduction in the frequency of the seizures, tolerability was measured through the side effects related to the drug and quality of life was assessed by means of the changes reflected in the CAVE questionnaires, in the case of children, and the QOLIE-31 for adults.	At the end of the study, total control over the seizures was 73.7% in patients who had not been treated previously and 43.8% in those in whom other monotherapies had failed; at the same time there was an improvement in the quality of life parameters. 42.9% reported side effects, which were usually tolerable or transient since they led to the withdrawal of OXC in only 9.6% of the patients.

1300,22858262,Journal of affective disorders,A preliminary open trial of nefazodone added to mood stabilizers for bipolar depression.,"Little information exists on the use of nefazodone to treat bipolar depression. We hypothesized that nefazodone added to a standard mood stabilizer would show significant antidepressant efficacy with minimal agitation or induction of mania, by virtue of its selective 5-HT(2A) blockade.	Thirteen DSM-IV pure depressed-phase nonpsychotic bipolar outpatients received an open-label 8-week pilot trial of flexibly dosed nefazodone (mean±SD peak dose=462.5±164.0mg/day) with a concurrent mood stabilizer or atypical antipsychotic. Primary outcomes included the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and Clinical Global Impressions Severity Scale (CGI-S).	All subjects completed at least 4 weeks of treatment, while 9 (69%) completed the 8-week protocol. Based on last observation point, 8 (62%) had at least a 50% reduction from baseline HAM-D scores. Significant improvement from baseline was observed in both HAM-D (z=2.05, p=.04) and CGI severity ratings (z=2.21, p=.03). Induction of mania occurred in 1 subject (7%). No subjects manifested clinical signs of hepatic failure, and none prematurely terminated the study due to other adverse events (most common side effects included fatigue, insomnia, nausea, or headache).	This was a small open-label pilot study with use of varied concomitant pharmacotherapies and no placebo comparator.	While nefazodone is seldom used in clinical practice due to concerns about rare but severe hepatotoxicity, it may represent a model for postsynaptic 5HT(2A) antagonism that mechanistically could help to inform the development of future treatments for bipolar depression.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The aim of this study was to identify which factors are predictive of buprenorphine injection in patients receiving office-based buprenorphine.	Subazur is a survey consisting of two longitudinal assessments of 111 stabilized patients receiving office-based buprenorphine in southeastern France.	Patients were interviewed by phone at enrolment and 6 months later about social characteristics, addictive behaviors, treatment experiences, overdoses and suicide ideation or attempt. A logistic regression based on generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used to identify factors associated with buprenorphine injection at any interview.	Among the 111 patients (32% women, mean age 38 years), 36 reported buprenorphine injection after having started treatment initiation in 40 interviews. After adjustment for time since first injection, individuals perceiving their prescribed dosage as inadequate (OR=2.6 95%CI[1.2-5.7]) and those reporting a history of suicide ideation or attempt (OR=2.7 95%CI[1.1-7.0]) had approximately a three-fold higher risk of injecting buprenorphine.	Providing adequate care for both drug dependence and psychiatric comorbidities in primary care is a major issue. Like heroin use during methadone treatment, buprenorphine injection should be regarded more as a response to inadequate care than simply as a 'misuse'. A re-assessment of the treatment efficacy through a possible dosage increase or a switch to methadone could potentially reduce diversion and assure sustained adherence to OST.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

METHODS: We explored the therapeutic responses by using a case-control study, which was conducted in Taiwan. We enrolled 30 participants with stable AD who were receiving cilostazol (50 mg) twice per day as an add-on therapy combined with AChEIs, and 30 participants as controls who were not receiving cilostazol as an add-on therapy. The therapeutic responses were measured using neuropsychological assessments and analyzed in relation to cilostazol use, apolipoprotein E genotype, and demographic characteristics. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) and clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) were administered at the outset of the study and 12 months later. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between the therapeutic response and cilostazol use. RESULTS: For the therapeutic indicator of cognition, Cilostazol use (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 0.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.03-0.80), initial CDR-SB score (aOR = 2.06, 95% CI = 1.31-3.72), and initial MMSE score (aOR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.11-1.90), but not age, sex, education, or ApoE ε4 status, were significantly associated with poor therapeutic outcomes.

METHODS: The Chronic Migraine OnabotulinuMtoxinA Prolonged Efficacy open-Label (COMPEL) study is a multicentre, open-label, prospective study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA 155 U over nine treatments (108 weeks) in adults with CM. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) scales were used to assess the effects of onabotulinumtoxinA on comorbid symptoms of depression and anxiety, respectively. A clinically meaningful improvement was assessed by the percentage of patients experiencing a ≥1 severity category reduction in PHQ-9 and GAD-7. The effects of onabotulinumtoxinA on associated sleep quality and fatigue were assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Fatigue Severity Scale, respectively. RESULTS: OnabotulinumtoxinA treatment was associated with sustained reduction in headache days and PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores in the analysis population (n=715) over 108 weeks. PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores were significantly reduced at all time points in patients with clinically significant symptoms of depression and/or anxiety at baseline. By week 108, 78.0% and 81.5% had clinically meaningful improvement in depression and anxiety symptoms, respectively. Sleep quality and symptoms of fatigue also improved; however, less is understood about clinically meaningful changes in these measures. No new safety concerns were identified. CONCLUSION: In addition to reducing headache frequency, onabotulinumtoxinA treatment for CM was associated with clinically meaningful reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety, and improved associated symptoms of poor sleep quality and fatigue.

1307,19644348,"AIDS (London, England)",Impact of HAART and CNS-penetrating antiretroviral regimens on HIV encephalopathy among perinatally infected children and adolescents,"OBJECTIVES: Prior to antiretroviral treatment, HIV-infected children frequently developed encephalopathy, resulting in debilitating morbidity and mortality. This is the first large study to evaluate the impact of HAART and central nervous system (CNS)-penetrating antiretroviral regimens on the incidence of HIV encephalopathy and survival after diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy among perinatally infected children. DESIGN: A total of 2398 perinatally HIV-infected children with at least one neurological examination were followed in a US-based prospective cohort study conducted from 1993 to 2007. METHODS: Trends in incidence rates over calendar time were described and Cox regression models were used to estimate the effects of time-varying HAART and CNS-penetrating antiretroviral regimens on HIV encephalopathy and on survival after diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy. RESULTS: During a median of 6.4 years of follow-up, 77 incident cases of HIV encephalopathy occurred [incidence rate 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years, 95% confidence interval (CI) 4.0-6.3]. A 10-fold decline in incidence was observed beginning in 1996, followed by a stable incidence rate after 2002. HAART regimens were associated with a 50% decrease (95% CI 14-71%) in the incidence of HIV encephalopathy compared with non-HAART regimens. High CNS-penetrating regimens were associated with a substantial survival benefit (74% reduction in the risk of death, 95% CI 39-89%) after HIV encephalopathy diagnosis compared with low CNS-penetrating regimens. CONCLUSION: A dramatic decrease in the incidence of HIV encephalopathy occurred after the introduction of HAART. The use of HAART was highly effective in reducing the incidence of HIV encephalopathy among perinatally infected children and adolescents. Effective CNS-penetrating antiretroviral regimens are important in affecting survival after diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1308,15820354,Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,Do antiepileptic drugs accelerate forgetting?,"The majority of patients with epilepsy become seizure-free with antiepileptic drug therapy. However, seizures in approximately one-third of patients with epilepsy are difficult to treat with antiepileptic drugs and require high doses or polytherapy. High dosages increase the risk of cognitive side effects. We retrospectively investigated 162 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy to determine whether the antiepileptic drugs carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin affect the acquisition and retention of verbal and visual information. We found that patients with high serum levels of these antiepileptic drugs were selectively impaired in the retention but not acquisition of new information. Intelligence, age, duration of epilepsy, and seizure frequency were controlled for and were not factors in the observed results. There were no differences in favor of a certain drug with respect to memory functioning. Our results suggest that patients with refractory epilepsy with high serum levels of the antiepileptic drugs studied are at higher risk of accelerated forgetting.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect, as well as drug quality (intensity, euphoria, and dysphoria), were studied before and after 10 to 12 days of buprenorphine maintenance. Saline was accurately identified by all 26 patients during the drugfree baseline and by 25 patients during buprenorphine maintenance conditions. All patients accurately identified morphine during the drugfree period before treatment with buprenorphine, but 18 (69%) of 26 patients were unable to detect morphine during buprenorphine maintenance and 2 misidentified morphine as cocaine. Six men (23%) accurately identified morphine and reported that the intensity and quality of morphine's effects were equivalent to drugfree conditions. Cocaine levels in plasma 5 minutes after intravenous cocaine injection were equivalent before and during buprenorphine treatment and averaged 282.8 +/- 43.6 and 295.2 +/- 28.8 ng/ml during 4 and 8 mg/day of buprenorphine maintenance, respectively. All patients accurately identified cocaine before and during buprenorphine maintenance, and there were no significant changes in latency to detection and certainty of a drug effect or reports of cocaine-induced intensity or euphoria during buprenorphine treatment. The concordance between responses to morphine and cocaine during inpatient buprenorphine maintenance and drug use during the first 4 weeks of outpatient buprenorphine treatment was also examined in 16 men.

METHODS: A test group (n = 28) of nursing home residents with low serum B12 levels (<250 pg/mL) and a matched comparison group (n = 28) with normal serum B12 levels (>300 pg/mL) were evaluated by blinded raters while the test group received intramuscular (IM) B12 replacement therapy. All subjects were assessed at baseline, 8 weeks, and 16 weeks with the Dementia Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and Geriatric Depression Scale. RESULTS: Although B12 replacement produced significant improvement in hematologic and metabolic parameters, it yielded no significant effect on cognitive or psychiatric variables. A few subjects evidenced notable individual treatment responses; however, these were not statistically more frequent than in the normal B12 group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that B12 replacement is unlikely to benefit cognitive or psychiatric symptoms in the vast majority of elderly dementia patients with low serum B12 levels.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1312,22421185,Seizure,Rufinamide as an adjuvant treatment in children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome,"PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in children and adolescents with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS). METHODS: The study was an open-label, observational clinical trial of rufinamide as an add-on treatment in intractable LGS patients. This intent-to-treat trial included 4 weeks of scheduled titrated doses and a 12-week maintenance phase with a target dose of 20-40 mg/kg rufinamide, adjusted according to its effectiveness and tolerability after a baseline period of 4 weeks. The primary outcome was measured by the seizure-reduction rate according to individual seizure type over the 12-week maintenance period. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-eight patients with LGS who were determined to be unresponsive to one or more antiepileptic drugs or dietary therapy were enrolled. Of the 128 patients enrolled, 112 (87.5%) completed the study. After add-on rufinamide treatment, 46 patients (35.9%) achieved a more than 50% reduction in seizure frequency and 10 (7.8%) patients became seizure-free. When we identified those who responded with an at least 50% reduction in seizure frequency, 39.4% of the responders reported reductions in convulsive seizures, 36.4% in drop attacks, 33.3% in myoclonic seizures, and 20.0% in epileptic spasms. Overall, 32.8% of patients reported adverse effects, which were mostly mild and transient in nature. The most common adverse effects were fatigue (15 patients, 11.7%) and poor appetite (9 patients, 7.0%). Twenty-one (16.4%) patients experienced an increased seizure frequency.

1314,14704590,American journal of therapeutics,Economic analysis of sildenafil citrate (Viagra) add-on to treat erectile dysfunction associated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor use.,"The objective of this study was to compare the economic cost of adding sildenafil citrate (Viagra, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY) to treat selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced erectile dysfunction with that of discontinuing antidepressant pharmacotherapy, switching patients to another SSRI, or adding a non-SSRI. Based on our real-world experience in an academic medical center, we performed an economic analysis of a hypothetical cohort of 1000 patients taking SSRIs on a course of acute and continuation treatment recommended by the American Psychiatric Association. We used standard costing of antidepressants, sildenafil, and unit costs for physician visits within a managed care environment and cost-of-illness methodology to calculate the annualized cost of depression for different treatment outcomes. After 6 months of SSRI treatment, the sildenafil add-on group had the lowest cost estimates compared with groups that discontinued SSRIs, substituted another SSRI (switching), or added a non-SSRI to the existing SSRI (augmentation). Sensitivity analyses demonstrated that the physician visit was the single most important cost component in this hypothetical population and relapse/remission the most costly outcome. Sildenafil can be a cost-effective add-on therapy to control SSRI-induced erectile dysfunction. Healthcare payors should consider this when developing optimum treatment strategies for men with depression.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

It remains unclear, however, when or how to transition stable buprenorphine-maintained individuals to complete abstinence. This trial investigates the feasibility of using naltrexone to facilitate buprenorphine discontinuation in stable individuals who had tolerated a taper to 2mg or less but were unable to terminate entirely due to withdrawal-related distress. METHODS: The sample consisted of 6 buprenorphine-maintained individuals in sustained full remission, and who had tolerated a taper but were unable to discontinue altogether. A rapid induction procedure was performed, which included supervised buprenorphine discontinuation, oral naltrexone titration with a starting dose of 6.25mg, and administration of long-acting injectable naltrexone. Participants were followed weekly for 5weeks after the injection, with telephone follow-up occurring at 6months. RESULTS: The rapid induction procedure was well tolerated. There was no observed or reported clinical worsening over the course of study participation. Notably, no participants experienced an increase in Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) scores after the first oral dose of NTX as compared to day 1 (24hours after last dose of buprenorphine); instead, SOWS scores decreased between days 1 and 7 (p=0.043). All participants were able to discontinue buprenorphine and to remain opioid free during the trial and at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary trial represented for all participants the first successful attempt at buprenorphine discontinuation. Further research is needed to better understand if naltrexone is effective at facilitating buprenorphine discontinuation, as well as the feasibility of a sequential approach (buprenorphine stabilization to naltrexone) for opioid use disorders.",Buprenorphine| Discontinuation| Naltrexone| Opioid dependence,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Part B, Neuropsychiatric genetics : the official publication of the International Society of Psychiatric Genetics",Identification of pharmacogenetic markers in smoking cessation therapy.,"Pharmacogenetic clinical trials seek to identify genetic modifiers of treatment effects. When a trial has collected data on many potential genetic markers, a first step in analysis is to screen for evidence of pharmacogenetic effects by testing for treatment-by-marker interactions in a statistical model for the outcome of interest. This approach is potentially problematic because (i) individual significance tests can be overly sensitive, particularly when sample sizes are large; and (ii) standard significance tests fail to distinguish between markers that are likely, on biological grounds, to have an effect, and those that are not. One way to address these concerns is to perform Bayesian hypothesis tests [Berger (1985) Statistical decision theory and Bayesian analysis. New York: Springer; Kass and Raftery (1995) J Am Stat Assoc 90:773-795], which are typically more conservative than standard uncorrected frequentist tests, less conservative than multiplicity-corrected tests, and make explicit use of relevant biological information through specification of the prior distribution. In this article we use a Bayesian testing approach to screen a panel of genetic markers recorded in a randomized clinical trial of bupropion versus placebo for smoking cessation. From a panel of 59 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located on 11 candidate genes, we identify four SNPs (one each on CHRNA5 and CHRNA2 and two on CHAT) that appear to have pharmacogenetic relevance. Of these, the SNP on CHRNA5 is most robust to specification of the prior. An unadjusted frequentist test identifies seven SNPs, including these four, none of which remains significant upon correction for multiplicity. In a panel of 43 randomly selected control SNPs, none is significant by either the Bayesian or the corrected frequentist test.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

However--despite the obvious likelihood that these symptoms may be reduced by antidepressive treatments--to date, the effectiveness of such treatments in HD has only ever been examined in case studies. Twenty-six HD patients (17 men), with a diagnosis of major depression, were studied. The symptoms of HD and depression were systematically measured using the Beck Depression Inventory and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression both at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment with venlafaxine XR. After 4 weeks of venlafaxine XR treatment, the symptoms of depression in HD patients decreased significantly relative to baseline. However, approximately one in five patients developed significant venlafaxine-related side effects (nausea and irritability). Venlafaxine XR is highly effective in the treatment of depression in HD, although it may produce unpleasant side effects. Further studies are required to establish the most suitable treatment for depression in HD.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1318,36063627,Journal of psychosomatic research,The effects of antidepressants on depressive symptoms in manifest Huntington's disease.,"Currently there is little evidence to guide the treatment of depression in Huntington's disease (HD). The primary objective was to determine the effectiveness of antidepressant medications on lowering depressive symptom scores in patients with manifest HD. The secondary objective was to determine the effect of antidepressant use on measures of disease progression.	After retrospectively identifying motor-manifest HD participants with at least borderline depressive symptoms from the Enroll-HD database, 86 new users of antidepressant medication were exact matched with non-users on depression score, and matched on propensity scores developed using age, sex, CAG repeat length, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures. Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the change in depression scores, anxiety scores, and disease progression measures based on antidepressant use between two visits approximately one-year apart.	There was no significant difference in the change in depression score between antidepressant users and non-users (p = 0.46). There were also no significant differences in the change in total motor score (p = 0.88), total functional capacity score (p = 0.16), number correct on the symbol digit modality test (p = 0.49), or anxiety score (p = 0.68).	Initiation of antidepressant medication was not associated with a greater reduction in depressive symptoms or changes in other symptoms when compared to non-use. The findings of this study support further research on the effectiveness of antidepressants in Huntington's disease patients. Clinical trials or studies with a larger sample of new antidepressant users should be used to assess the causal effects of antidepressant medications on depressive symptoms.",Antidepressants| Depression| Huntington's disease,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Our objective was to study the incidence of, and predictors for, long-term use of benzodiazepines and Z-drugs in bipolar disorder.	We conducted a population-based cohort study, using data from Swedish national registers. Swedish residents aged 18-75 years with a recorded diagnosis of bipolar disorder or mania between July 2006 and December 2012, and no history of benzodiazepine/Z-drug use in the past year, were included. Patients were followed for 1 year with regard to prescription fills of benzodiazepines/Z-drugs. Initiators were followed for another year during which continuous use for >6 months was defined as 'long-term'. Patient and prescription characteristics were investigated as potential predictors for long-term use in multivariate logistic regression models.	Out of the 21 883 patients included, 29% started benzodiazepine/Z-drug treatment, of whom one in five became long-term users. Patients who were prescribed clonazepam or alprazolam had high odds for subsequent long-term use (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 3.78 [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.24-6.38] and 2.03 [95% CI 1.30-3.18], respectively), compared to those prescribed diazepam. Polytherapy with benzodiazepines/Z-drugs also predicted long-term use (aOR 2.46, 95% CI 1.79-3.38), as did age ≥60 years (aOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.46-2.53, compared to age <30 years), and concomitant treatment with psychostimulants (aOR 1.78, 95% CI 1.33-2.39).	The incidence of subsequent long-term use among bipolar benzodiazepine initiators is high. Patients on clonazepam, alprazolam or benzodiazepine/Z-drug polytherapy have the highest risk of becoming long-term users, suggesting that these treatments should be used restrictively.",benzodiazepines| bipolar disorder| cohort study| drug utilization study| prescription drug misuse| zaleplon| zolpidem| zopiclone,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay. The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline (3 microM). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30-60 micrograms) was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection.	In vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3-100 micrograms) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5-10 microM). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 microM) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 micrograms) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 micrograms) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses.	These results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This article focuses on 8 cases in which treatment with candesartan was successful in reducing both the incidence and severity of headache in hypertensive patients with migraine. The cases reported in this article showed a mean improvement in Migraine Disability Assessment score from 29.4 to 9 points and in blood pressure from 154.9/90.4 to 129.5/81.9mmHg, suggesting that candesartan is an extremely attractive option for the treatment of migraine. Although recent studies have reported the efficacy of candesartan for treating migraine, there has been no description of its potential advantages over other prophylactic drugs. The present study included patients who could not tolerate triptans for whom triptans were contraindicated, several patients for whom other migraine prophylactic drugs showed little or no effect, and one patient for whom candesartan was prescribed initially for hypertension, but was also found to be therapeutic for migraines. Thus candesartan is considered to be a unique, attractive choice of prophylactic agent for migraine complicated by hypertension.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This open study investigated whether cholinergic substitution therapy may be a treatment option. The effect of donepezil, a cholinesterase inhibitor on memory functions was tested in an open-label, exploratory study in 11 patients with a chronic amnestic syndrome from a ruptured and repaired aneurysm of the anterior communicating artery (seven patients), the anterior cerebral (two) or the pericallosal artery (two). Mean time since onset was 75.4 months. Memory was evaluated at baseline and consecutively after 4 weeks of 5 mg donepezil daily, 8 weeks of 10 mg donepezil, and 4 weeks after drug discontinuation. Memory functions were assessed using the California Verbal Learning Test and compared with a matched group of normal, untreated controls. Tests of attention and of executive functions were also administered. Donepezil was well tolerated. Strong group effects were found at baseline and at all follow-up measurements showing profound impairments of memory functions in the patient group. Within patient statistics showed significant improvements of short and long delay free recall scores during the treatment period, both with 5 and 10 mg donepezil daily, whereas attentional and executive functions improved only non-significantly. Memory functions decreased after drug discontinuation. Repeated test administration in the control group also showed an increase of memory scores which was minor when compared with the performance change in the patient group. Donepezil may improve episodic memory functions in patients suffering from a chronic amnestic syndrome caused by rupture and repair of aneurysms of the anterior communicating, the anterior cerebral or the pericallosal artery.

The degree of cognitive function, activities of daily living score, and the degree of BPSD were determined using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD), Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and the Rating Scale for Aggressive Behaviour in the Elderly (RAGE). The severity of extrapyramidal symptoms was assessed using the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms scale (DIEEPS). Five patients were enrolled. These patients met the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. The patients were prescribed more than two kinds of existing antipsychotic drugs and were considered refractory cases; the drugs were discontinued because they were ineffectual and side-effects appeared. Each drug was prescribed independently for at least 2 weeks. The mean changes (at baseline and at the last week, respectively) in the MMSE (12.25, 9.25), in the DAD (6.5, 6.75), in the RAGE (5.5, 5.3) and in the DIEEPS (0.5, 1.5) were minimal. The mean changes in the NPI were two or fewer points. Some side-effects (one gait abnormality and one pneumonia) were observed. The results of this preliminary study show that blonanserin does not have adequate efficacy for the treatment of refractory BPSD.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
1326,11025624,Neurology India,A double blind controlled study of propranolol and cyproheptadine in migraine prophylaxis.,"Role of propranolol and cyproheptadine in the prophylaxis of migraine was studied in a controlled double blind trial. Two hundred fifty-nine patients were divided into four groups. Each group was either given a placebo, cyproheptadine, propranolol or a combination of the latter two drugs. The patients were followed for a period of three months. Significant relief in frequency, duration and severity from migranous attacks was seen in all drug treated groups over placebo. Significant correlation in response was seen in frequency, duration and severity in all the groups which received drugs. Statistically more significant relief was seen in cyproheptadine and propranolol treated group as compared to individual drug treated groups. In cyproheptadine and propranolol treated groups, the dropout rate was lower and associated symptoms were better relieved than in other groups.

Behavioral, psychological, and physiologic measures of the impact of sleep restriction were compared between groups at baseline, during sleep restriction, and following recovery sleep.	Two sleep research laboratories.	Thirty-eight healthy adults; 9 men and 10 women (mean age: 26.0 +/- 6.1 years) in the placebo group and 8 men and 11 women (mean age: 26.7 +/- 8.1 years) in the tiagabine 8 mg group	Both experimental groups underwent 4 nights of sleep restriction. Each group received either tiagabine 8 mg or placebo on all sleep-restriction nights, and both groups received placebo on baseline and recovery nights.	Polysomnography documented a SWS-enhancing effect of tiagabine. The placebo group displayed the predicted deficits due to sleep restriction on the Psychomotor Vigilance Task and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test. Compared with placebo, the tiagabine group did not demonstrate impairment in sustained attention on the Psychomotor Vigilance Test, performed better on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task, reported more restorative sleep, and had less of an increase in afternoon-evening salivary free cortisol. Multiple Sleep Latency Test, ratings of sleepiness, recovery sleep, and other measures did not differ between groups.	To our knowledge these findings are the first to be consistent with the hypothesis that pharmacologic SWS enhancement reduces selective aspects of the behavioral, psychological, and physiologic impact of sleep restriction.",,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

METHODS: Authors used an open-label trial of folic acid, vitamin B(12), and vitamin B(6), in combination for 8 weeks, with measurement of plasma homocysteine levels in the fasting state and after methionine-loading. A total of 69 subjects with AD were enrolled, including 33 who were taking standard multivitamin supplements; 66 were available at 8-week follow-up. RESULTS: The high-dose vitamin regimen was associated with a significant reduction in fasting and post-methionine-loading homocysteine. Reductions were greater in the subgroup not using multivitamins, but were also significant in the multivitamin users. CONCLUSION: High-dose vitamin supplementation reduces homocysteine levels in patients with AD.

In the present study objective methods included immediate and late recall and recognition of pictures, Stroop test and auditory selection. Twenty patients with symptomatic localized epilepsy aged 17-52 years (27 +/- 10, mean +/- sd) were compared to age and socially matched healthy controls. Patients were on therapeutic serum concentrations (25 +/- 12 mu/ml) of phenobarbitone and had active epilepsy with 1.94 generalized tonic-clonic, 0.85 simple partial and 6.28 complex partial seizures monthly (means). Patients performed worse than controls in all 6 tests (p less than 0.05 to p less than 0.001), indicating a generalized cognitive deficit related to seizures and/or barbiturate therapy.

1330,35759349,Schizophrenia bulletin,Effect of Intranasal Oxytocin on Resting-state Effective Connectivity in Schizophrenia,"OBJECTIVES: Evidence from several lines of research suggests the critical role of neuropeptide oxytocin in social cognition and social behavior. Though a few studies have examined the effect of oxytocin on clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, the underlying neurobiological changes are underexamined. Hence, in this study, we examined the effect of oxytocin on the brain's effective connectivity in schizophrenia. METHODS: 31 male patients with schizophrenia (SCZ) and 21 healthy male volunteers (HV) underwent resting functional magnetic resonance imaging scans with intra-nasal oxytocin (24 IU) and placebo administered in counterbalanced order. We conducted a whole-brain effective connectivity analysis using a multivariate vector autoregressive granger causality model. We performed a conjunction analysis to control for spurious changes and canonical correlation analysis between changes in connectivity and clinical and demographic variables. RESULTS: Three connections, sourced from the left caudate survived the FDR correction threshold with the conjunction analysis; connections to the left supplementary motor area, left precentral gyrus, and left frontal inferior triangular gyrus. At baseline, SCZ patients had significantly weaker connectivity from caudate to these three regions. Oxytocin, but not placebo, significantly increased the strength of connectivity in these connections. Better cognitive insight and lower negative symptoms were associated with a greater increase in connectivity with oxytocin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide a preliminary mechanistic understanding of the effect of oxytocin on brain connectivity in schizophrenia. The study findings provide the rationale to examine the potential utility of oxytocin for social cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.",fMRI| negative symptoms| neuropeptide| psychosis| social cognition,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Knowledge of the identity and trajectory of symptom clusters (SCs) would enhance measurement and management.	We aimed to identify SCs and their change over time from baseline to completion of breast cancer CTX.	SCs were identified and assessed for change in 219 women from Nebraska at four times: baseline, during cycles #3 and #4 of CTX, and one month after finishing CTX. Ten symptoms were measured: two using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and eight using the Symptom Experience Scale. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted at each time point, then changes in SCs were evaluated at different times.	Two SCs were identified before and after initiating CTX: gastrointestinal and treatment-related. The number and type of symptoms in each cluster differed over time. Clusters were dynamic during CTX with changes in the number and type of symptoms. Only one treatment-related SC, which consisted of fatigue, pain, and sleep disturbance, was identified after CTX completion.	SCs during CTX appear to be dynamic, changing over time from before until after CTX completion.

We retrospectively reviewed 1653 plasma samples from 709 patients (aged 6 months to 16 years) and compared the concentration-to-dose ratio (CD ratio) of LTG among different AED regimens. The median CD ratio of patients receiving LTG monotherapy was 1.25 μg/mL/mg/kg. In patients receiving LTG plus VPA, the CD ratio was increased by about 140%. The CD ratio was elevated from a low VPA concentration (<40 μg/mL) and the increase was VPA concentration-dependent. In contrast, the median CD ratio of patients treated with LTG plus the inducers phenytoin, phenobarbital, and carbamazepine was 0.42, 0.63, and 0.66, respectively, and phenytoin significantly reduced the CD ratio in comparison with phenobarbital or carbamazepine (p < 0.001). Pediatric patients of all ages beyond infancy showed similar susceptibility to VPA or inducers, but infants had higher CD ratios compared with the other age groups. Among other AEDs, topiramate, ethosuximide, and rufinamide reduced the CD ratio. These findings should be useful for estimating interactions between LTG and concomitant AEDs.",Children| Drug interaction| Lamotrigine| Pharmacokinetics| Therapeutic drug monitoring,Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Neurovascular compromise is also prevalent in AD and FTD however the relationship between tau and the neurovascular unit is less understood relative to other degenerative phenotypes. Current animal models confer the ability to recapitulate aspects of the CNS tauopathies, however, existing models either display overaggressive phenotypes, or do not develop neuronal loss or genuine neurofibrillary lesions. In this report, we communicate the longitudinal characterization of brain tauopathy in a novel transgenic rat model, coded McGill-R955-hTau. The model expresses the longest isoform of human P301S tau. Homozygous R955-hTau rats displayed a robust, progressive accumulation of mutated human tau leading to the detection of tau hyperphosphorylation and cognitive deficits accelerating from 14 months of age. This model features extensive tau hyperphosphorylation with endogenous tau recruitment, authentic neurofibrillary lesions, and tau-associated neuronal loss, ventricular dilation, decreased brain volume, and gliosis in aged rats. Further, we demonstrate how neurovascular integrity becomes compromised at aged life stages using a combination of electron microscopy, injection of the tracer horseradish peroxidase and immunohistochemical approaches.",human tauopathy| neurofibrillary tangles| neurovascular compromise| transgenic rat model,Animal-other,5,1
1335,35733405,"Genes, brain, and behavior",Abnormal whisker movements in the 3xTg-AD mouse model of Alzheimer's disease,"Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent form of dementia in elderly people. The triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mouse model of Alzheimer's Disease is important in biomedical research as these mice develop both neuropathological and behavioural phenotypes. However, their behavioural phenotype is variable, with findings depending on the specific task, as well as the age and sex of the mice. Whisker movements show motor, sensory and cognitive deficits in mouse models of neurodegenerative disease. Therefore, we examined whisker movements in 3, 12.5 and 17-month-old female 3xTg-AD mice and their B6129S/F2 wildtype controls. Mice were filmed using a high-speed video camera (500 fps) in an open arena during a novel object exploration task. Genotype and age differences were found in mice exploring the arena prior to object contact. Prior to whisker contact, the 3-month-old 3xTg-AD mice had smaller whisker angles compared with the wildtype controls, suggesting an early motor phenotype in these mice. Pre-contact mean angular position at 3 months and whisking amplitude at 17 months of age differed between the 3xTg-AD and wildtype mice. During object contact 3xTg-AD mice did not reduce whisker spread as frequently as the wildtype mice at 12.5 and 17 months, which may suggest sensory or attentional deficits. We show that whisker movements are a powerful behavioural measurement tool for capturing behavioural deficits in mouse models that show complex phenotypes, such as the 3xTg-AD mouse model.",Alzheimer's| animal behaviour| disease model| mouse model| neurodegeneration| rodent| sensorimotor| transgenic| vibrissae| whisker,Animal-other,5,1
1336,34726298,Glia,Astrocyte-neuronal network interplay is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease mice,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with senile plaques of beta-amyloid (Aβ) that affect the function of neurons and astrocytes. Brain activity results from the coordinated function of neurons and astrocytes in astroglial-neuronal networks. However, the effects of Aβ on astroglial and neuronal network function remains unknown. Simultaneously monitoring astrocyte calcium and electric neuronal activities, we quantified the impact of Aβ on sensory-evoked cortical activity in a mouse model of AD. At rest, cortical astrocytes displayed spontaneous hyperactivity that was related to Aβ density. Sensory-evoked astrocyte responsiveness was diminished in AD mice, depending on the density and distance of Aβ, and the responses showed altered calcium dynamics. Hence, astrocytes were spontaneously hyperactive but hypo-responsive to sensory stimulation. Finally, AD mice showed sensory-evoked electrical cortical hyperresponsiveness associated with altered astrocyte-neuronal network interplay. Our findings suggest dysfunction of astrocyte networks in AD mice may dysregulate cortical electrical activity and contribute to cognitive decline.",APP/PS1| Alzheimer's disease| astrocyte| astrogliosis| beta amyloid| cortex,Animal-other,5,1
1337,12511771,Stroke,Differential regulation of thrombospondin-1 and thrombospondin-2 after focal cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.,"Angiogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia, and the extent of angiogenesis has been correlated with survival in stroke patients. However, postischemic angiogenesis is short-lived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult. The molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood. Although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models, the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated. Thrombospondin (TSP)-1 and TSP-2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors, which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo. The aim of the present study was to explore the expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats.	Rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks. Northern and Western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of TSP-1 and TSP-2 expression at the mRNA and protein level, respectively. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns. Double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of TSP-1 and TSP-2.	A biphasic expression of TSP-1 was noted after ischemia, peaking at 1 and 72 hours. Endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first TSP-1 peak, whereas endothelial, glial, neuronal, and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of TSP-1 expression. TSP-2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner, peaking 2 weeks after ischemia. TSP-2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial, neuronal, and macrophage, but not glial, cells. TSP-1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis, whereas robust TSP-2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved.	Robust expression of TSP-1 and TSP-2, 2 major angiostatic factors, was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins. The expression of these angiostatic factors, especially TSP-2, likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis. Further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain.",,Animal-other,5,1
1338,20077474,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Kinematic and electromyographic tools for characterizing movement disorders in mice.,"Increasing interest in rodent models for movement disorders has led to an increasing need for more accurate and precise methods for both delineating the nature of abnormal movements and measuring their severity. These studies describe application of simultaneous high-speed video kinematics with multichannel electromyography (EMG) to characterize the movement disorder exhibited by tottering mutant mice. These mice provide a uniquely valuable model, because they exhibit paroxysmal dystonia superimposed on mild baseline ataxia, permitting the examination of these two different problems within the same animals. At baseline with mild ataxia, the mutants exhibited poorly coordinated movements with increased variation of stance and swing times, and slower spontaneous walking velocities. The corresponding EMG showed reduced mean amplitudes of biceps femoris and vastus lateralis, and poorly modulated EMG activities during the step cycle. Attacks of paroxysmal dystonia were preceded by trains of EMG bursts with doublets and triplets simultaneously in the biceps femoris and vastus lateralis followed by more sustained coactivation. These EMG characteristics are consistent with the clinical phenomenology of the motor phenotype of tottering mice as a baseline of mild ataxia with intermittent attacks of paroxysmal dystonia. The EMG characteristics of ataxia and dystonia in the tottering mice also are consistent with EMG studies of other ataxic or dystonic animals and humans. These studies provide insights into how these methods can be used for delineating movement disorders in mice and for how they may be compared with similar disorders of humans.",,Animal-other,5,1

First, we found that the specific ethanol sensitivity hypothesis is not supported by the relevant literature. Second, we found that much of the ambiguity with respect to this hypothesis concerns just pentobarbital. Consequently, the major intent of this paper was to further explore what effect pentobarbital had on these two mouse lines. Additionally, we examined the effects of barbital and ethanol. Our results for each of these compounds clearly indicate that when these mouse lines can be differentiated by particular doses the long-sleep animals always displayed greater narcotic reactions. In this inquiry only one sex was employed, and testing was always initiated at the same time of day. It is our contention that many of the equivocal findings that have been reported concerning pentobarbital are due to combining data from both sexes, circadian rhythmicity, and similar procedural variables.",,Animal-other,5,1

The state of the astrocytes was assessed by immunocytochemical staining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). HCP and TET caused a dose-related spongiosis, but cuprizone had no significant effect on the brain. With chronic HCP treatment, the spongiosis was accompanied by astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation, and the extent of the gliotic reaction was related to the dose of HCP. The results demonstrate that HCP can produce and maintain astrocyte proliferation in the rat brain.

When injected into C57BL/6J mice, MPTP penetrates into the brain and is converted to 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP[+]) by monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B in astrocytes. MPP[+] has high affinity for the dopamine transporter (DAT) on dopaminergic neurons, and is taken up into the cell to cause cell death. There have been relatively few researches on the acute MPTP toxicity to embryonic or newborn mice. In the present study, we attempted to evaluate the influence of MPTP and MPP[+] on embryonic and newborn mice by measuring sequential changes in major indexes of MPTP toxicity and MPTP metabolism; levels of Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH), DAT, MAO-A and MAO-B. In addition, we measured the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA), in the brain of newborn mice. A single injection of MPTP and MPP[+] reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites, DOPAC and HVA, in the brain of newborn mice about 6-12 hr after the injection. Similarly the levels of mRNAs and proteins of DAT and TH were lowered in the brain of embryonic and newborn mice as well. The levels of these indexes were generally recovered at 24 hr after injection, indicating that the neurotoxicity induced by a single injection of MPTP or MPP[+] is temporary and recoverable in embryonic and newborn mice. By contrast, no significant changes in the expression levels of MAO-A and MAO-B were observed in either MPTP- or MPP[+]-treated mice.",,Animal-other,5,1

Abnormalities in white matter are associated with the development of depression. Here, the authors show that mice with oligodendrocyte-specific deletion of Nerve injury-induced protein 2 （Ninj2) exhibit depressive-like behaviors. Loss of Ninj2 in oligodendrocytes inhibits oligodendrocyte development and myelination, and impairs neuronal structure and activities. Ninj2 competitively inhibits TNFα/TNFR1 signaling pathway by directly binding to TNFR1 in oligodendrocytes. Loss of Ninj2 activates TNFα-induced necroptosis, and increases C-C Motif Chemokine Ligand 2 (Ccl2) production, which might mediate the signal transduction from oligodendrocyte to neurons. Inhibition of necroptosis by Nec-1s administration synchronously restores oligodendrocyte development, improves neuronal excitability, and alleviates depressive-like behaviors. This study thus illustrates the role of Ninj2 in the development of depression and myelination, reveals the relationship between oligodendrocytes and neurons, and provides a potential therapeutic target for depression.",Ninj2| depression| necroptosis| oligodendrocytes,Animal-other,5,1

The upregulation of the SAP97 transcripts in the adult neocortex after the acute PCP injection was mimicked by another NMDA antagonist, dizocilpine, but not by the indirect dopamine agonists, methamphetamine and cocaine, a selective D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390, a D2 receptor-preferring antagonist haloperidol and a GABAergic anesthetic pentobarbital. Moreover, the pretreatment with a typical antipsychotic haloperidol failed to antagonize the increased neocortical SAP97 gene expression by PCP.

Well-established rapid assays allow for high-throughput analyses of behavior but have several drawbacks, including measurements of daytime behaviors in nocturnal animals, effects of animal handling, and the lack of an acclimation period in the testing apparatus. We developed a novel 8-cage imaging system, with animated visual stimuli, for automated analyses of mouse behavior in 22-h overnight recordings. Software for image analysis was developed in two open-source programs, ImageJ and DeepLabCut. The imaging system was tested using 4-5 month-old female wild-type mice and 3xTg-AD mice, a widely-used model to study Alzheimer's disease (AD). The overnight recordings provided measurements of multiple behaviors including acclimation to the novel cage environment, day and nighttime activity, stretch-attend postures, location in various cage areas, and habituation to animated visual stimuli. The behavioral profiles were different in wild-type and 3xTg-AD mice. AD-model mice displayed reduced acclimation to the novel cage environment, were hyperactive during the first hour of darkness, and spent less time at home in comparison to wild-type mice. We propose that the imaging system may be used to study various neurological and neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease.",,Animal-other,5,1

However, past pharmacological approaches have failed to resolve whether activation or blockade of this receptor would have greater therapeutic benefit. To address this issue, we generated compound mice expressing a human amyloid precursor protein gene with familial AD mutations in combination with deficiency of amylin receptors produced by hemizygosity for the critical calcitonin receptor subunit of this heterodimeric GPCR. These compound transgenic AD mice demonstrated attenuated responses to human amylin- and Aβ-induced depression of hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) in keeping with the genetic depletion of amylin receptors.

1349,22745378,"Journal of immunology (Baltimore, Md. : 1950)",Transcriptional regulator Id2 is required for the CD4 T cell immune response in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.,"An effective immune response to Ag challenge is critically dependent on the size of the effector cell population generated from clonal activation of Ag-specific T cells. The transcription network involved in regulating the size of the effector population, particularly for CD4 Th cells, is poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the role of Id2, an inhibitor of E protein transcription factors, in the generation of CD4 effectors. Using a T cell-specific conditional Id2 knockout mouse model, we show that inhibitor of DNA binding (Id)2 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. Although Ag-specific and IL-17-producing CD4 T cells are produced in these mice, the activated CD4 T cells form a smaller pool of effector cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs, exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death, and are largely absent in the CNS. In the absence of Id2, E protein targets, including the proapoptotic protein Bim and SOCS3, are expressed at higher levels among activated CD4 T cells. This study reveals a critical role of Id2 in the control of effector CD4 T cell population size and the development of a Th17-mediated autoimmune disease.",,Animal-other,5,1

We have used microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuroAIDS to identify 98 genes, many previously unrecognized in lentiviral CNS pathogenesis, whose expression is significantly up-regulated in the frontal lobe of simian immunodeficiency virus-infected brains. Further, through immunohistochemical illumination, distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages, endothelial cells and resident glia, such as CD163, Glut5, and ISG15. In addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons (ie, cyclin D3, tissue transglutaminase, alpha1-antichymotrypsin, and STAT1), which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or HIV-related CNS pathology. This molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons. These data support the hypothesis that in HIV-induced CNS disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to CNS dysfunction by directly damaging neurons, as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function.",,Animal-other,5,1

Treatment-induced pericystic inflammation and its association with blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, as determined by Evans blue (EB) extravasation, was studied in infected untreated and anthelmintic-treated pigs. We compared the magnitude and extent of the pericystic inflammation, presence of EB-stained capsules, the level of damage to the parasite, expression of genes for proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, chemokines, and tissue remodeling by quantitative PCR assays between treated and untreated infected pigs and between EB-stained (blue) and non stained (clear) cysts. Inflammatory scores were higher in pericystic tissues from EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts from untreated pigs and also from anthelmintic-treated pigs 48 hr and 120 hr after treatment. The degree of inflammation correlated with the severity of cyst wall damage and both increased significantly at 120 hours. Expression levels of the proinflammatory genes for IL-6, IFN-γ, TNF-α were higher in EB-stained cysts compared to clear cysts and unaffected brain tissues, and were generally highest at 120 hr. Additionally, expression of some markers of immunoregulatory activity (IL-10, IL-2Rα) were decreased in EB-stained capsules. An increase in other markers for regulatory T cells (CTLA4, FoxP3) was found, as well as significant increases in expression of two metalloproteases, MMP1 and MMP2 at 48 hr and 120 hr post-treatment. We conclude that the increase in severity of the inflammation caused by treatment is accompanied by both a proinflammatory and a complex regulatory response, largely limited to pericystic tissues with compromised vascular integrity. Because treatment induced inflammation occurs in porcine NCC similar to that in human cases, this model can be used to investigate mechanisms involved in host damaging inflammatory responses and agents or modalities that may control damaging post treatment inflammation.",,Animal-other,5,1

We used human Tau purified from yeast models to generate new monoclonal antibodies, of which three were further characterized. The first antibody, ADx201, binds the Tau proline-rich region independently of the phosphorylation status, whereas the second, ADx215, detects an epitope formed by the Tau N terminus when Tau is not phosphorylated at Tyr(18). For the third antibody, ADx210, the binding site could not be determined because its epitope is probably conformational. All three antibodies stained tangle-like structures in different brain sections of THY-Tau22 transgenic mice and Alzheimer patients, and ADx201 and ADx210 also detected neuritic plaques in the cortex of the patient brains. In hippocampal homogenates from THY-Tau22 mice and cortex homogenates obtained from Alzheimer patients, ADx215 consistently stained specific low order Tau oligomers in diseased brain, which in size correspond to Tau dimers. ADx201 and ADx210 additionally reacted to higher order Tau oligomers and presumed prefibrillar structures in the patient samples. Our data further suggest that formation of the low order Tau oligomers marks an early disease stage that is initiated by Tau phosphorylation at N-terminal sites. Formation of higher order oligomers appears to require additional phosphorylation in the C terminus of Tau. When used to assess Tau levels in human cerebrospinal fluid, the antibodies permitted us to discriminate patients with Alzheimer disease or other dementia like vascular dementia, indicative that these antibodies hold promising diagnostic potential.",Alzheimer Disease| Antibody| Protein Folding| Protein Oligomer| Tau Protein (Tau)| Yeast,Animal-other,5,1
1354,37918702,Brain research,A rat model established by simulating genetic-environmental interactions recapitulates human Alzheimer's disease pathology,"BACKGROUND: In humans, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is typically sporadic in nature, and its pathology is usually influenced by extensive factors. The study established a rat model based on the genetic-environmental interaction. METHODS: A rat model was established by transduction of an adeno-associated virus combined with acrolein treatment. Rats were assigned to the normal control (NC), acrolein group, AAV (-) group, AAV-APP group, and AAV-APP/acrolein group. The success of model construction was verified in multiple ways, including by assessing cognitive function, examining microstructural changes in the brain in vivo, and performing immunohistochemistry. The contribution of genetic (APP mutation) and environmental (acrolein) factors to AD-like phenotypes in the model was explored by factorial analysis. RESULTS: 1) The AAV-APP/acrolein group showed a decline in cognitive function, as indicated by a reduced gray matter volume in key cognition-related brain areas, lower FA values in the hippocampus and internal olfactory cortex, and Aβ deposition in the cortex and hippocampus. 2) The AAV-APP group also showed a decline in cognitive function, although the group exhibited atypical brain atrophy in the gray matter and insignificant Aβ deposition. 3) The acrolein group did not show any significant changes in Aβ levels, gray matter volume, or cognitive function. 4) The genetic factor (APP mutation) explained 39.74% of the AD-like phenotypes in the model factors, and the environmental factor (acrolein exposure) explained 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic-environmental interaction rat model exhibited a phenotype that resembled the features of human AD and will be useful for research on AD.",Alzheimer's disease| Interaction| MRI| Rat model,Animal-other,5,1
1355,35501379,Nature neuroscience,Maladaptive myelination promotes generalized epilepsy progression,"Activity-dependent myelination can fine-tune neural network dynamics. Conversely, aberrant neuronal activity, as occurs in disorders of recurrent seizures (epilepsy), could promote maladaptive myelination, contributing to pathogenesis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that activity-dependent myelination resulting from absence seizures, which manifest as frequent behavioral arrests with generalized electroencephalography (EEG) spike-wave discharges, promote thalamocortical network hypersynchrony and contribute to epilepsy progression. We found increased oligodendrogenesis and myelination specifically within the seizure network in two models of generalized epilepsy with absence seizures (Wag/Rij rats and Scn8a(+/mut) mice), evident only after epilepsy onset. Aberrant myelination was prevented by pharmacological seizure inhibition in Wag/Rij rats. Blocking activity-dependent myelination decreased seizure burden over time and reduced ictal synchrony as assessed by EEG coherence. These findings indicate that activity-dependent myelination driven by absence seizures contributes to epilepsy progression; maladaptive myelination may be pathogenic in some forms of epilepsy and other neurological diseases.",,Animal-other,5,1
1356,34896334,Experimental neurology,"Contusion brain damage in mice for modelling of post-traumatic epilepsy with contralateral hippocampus sclerosis: Comprehensive and longitudinal characterization of spontaneous seizures, neuropathology, and neuropsychiatric comorbidities","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of acquired epilepsy referred to as post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE), characterized by spontaneous recurrent seizures (SRS) that start in the months or years following TBI. There is a critical need to develop small animal models for advancing the neurotherapeutics of PTE, which accounts for 20% of all acquired epilepsy cases. Despite many previous attempts, there are few PTE models with demonstrated consistency or longitudinal incidence of SRS, a critical feature for creating models for investigation of novel therapeutics for preventing PTE. Over the past few years, we have made in-depth updates and several advances to our mouse model of TBI in which SRS consistently occurs upon 24/7 monitoring for 4 months. Here, we show that an advanced cortical contusion damage in mice elicits a chronic state of PTE with SRS and robust epileptiform activity, along with cognitive comorbidities. We observed SRS in 33% and 87% of moderate and severe injury cohorts, respectively. Though incidence was higher in the severe cohort, moderate injury elicited a robust epileptogenesis. Progressive neuronal damage, neurodegeneration, and inflammation signals were evident in many brain regions; comorbid behavior and cognitive deficits were observed for up to 4-months. SRS onset was correlated with the inception of interneuron loss after TBI. Contralateral hippocampal sclerosis was unique and well correlated with SRS, confirming a potential network basis for epileptogenesis. Collectively, this mouse model exhibits a number of hallmark TBI sequelae reminiscent of human PTE. This model provides a vital tool for probing molecular pathological mechanisms and therapeutic interventions for post-traumatic epileptogenesis. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: TBI is a leading cause of post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE). Despite many attempts to create PTE in animals, success has been limited due to a lack of consistent spontaneous ""epileptic"" seizures after TBI. We present a comprehensive phenotype of PTE after contusion brain injury in mice, which exhibits robust spontaneous seizures along with neuronal loss, inflammation, and cognitive dysfunction. Our broad profiling of a TBI mouse reveals features of progressive, long-lasting epileptic activity, unique contralateral hippocampal sclerosis, and comorbid mood and memory deficits. The PTE mouse shows a striking consistency in recapitulating major pathological sequelae of human PTE. This mouse model will be helpful in assessing mechanisms and interventions for TBI-induced epilepsy and mood dysfunction.",Brain injury| CCI| HFOs| Hippocampus| Microgliosis| Post-traumatic epilepsy| Seizure,Animal-other,5,1

The clinical manifestations of cerebral ischemia were more significantly pronounced in the second group. This group was also characterized by a more marked hyperemia of the gastrointestinal tract as shown both macro- and microscopically.

The present work studied the temporal variation of three key antioxidant enzymes in cortex and hippocampus during the development of behavioral and cognitive symptoms in 3xTg-AD mice, and as compared to age-matched controls. At 2 months of age, when no intraneuronal Aβ immunoreactivity has been reported, increased neophobia shown as a delayed and reduced rearing, evidenced the onset of BPSD-like symptoms at premorbid stages of disease. In these animals, NQO1 was found increased in both the hippocampus (800%) and cortex (400%) and progressively diminished at older ages. SOD1 was increased in the hippocampus at 4 months of age, when neuronal Aβ accumulation has been established. These hippocampal increases of antioxidants before the prodromal emergence of cognitive symptoms support their role as defense mechanisms. SIRT1 levels showed opposite age-dependent changes in cortex (increase) and hippocampus (decrease) relative to controls. Prodromal cognitive deficits emerged at 6 months of age, concomitantly to cortical overexpression of SIRT1 but down-regulation of NQO1 and SIRT1 in the hippocampus, suggesting inadequate antioxidative protection to prevent or delay the subjacent neuronal damage. The present data further support the link between oxidative status and the anxious profile. Their crosstalk may underline AD-pathological mechanisms that may lead to deranged physiology and selective neuronal degeneration. It also points out increased neophobia and high expression of NQO1 among the first indicators of disease in the 3xTg-AD mice.",3xTg-AD mouse| AD-C| AD-P| Alzheimer's disease| Antioxidant enzymes| Behavior,Animal-other,5,1

This study aimed to determine the physiological time structure of tibialis anterior activity during sleep in mice and rats, and compare it with that of healthy humans. Wild-type mice (n = 9) and rats (n = 8) were instrumented with electrodes for recording the electroencephalogram and electromyogram of neck muscles and both tibialis anterior muscles. Healthy human subjects (31 ± 1 years, n = 21) underwent overnight polysomnography. An algorithm for automatic scoring of tibialis anterior electromyogram events of mice and rats during non-rapid eye movement sleep was developed and validated. Visual scoring assisted by this algorithm had inter-rater sensitivity of 92-95% and false-positive rates of 13-19% in mice and rats. The distribution of the time intervals between consecutive tibialis anterior electromyogram events during non-rapid eye movement sleep had a single peak extending up to 10 s in mice, rats and human subjects. The tibialis anterior electromyogram events separated by intervals <10 s mainly occurred in series of two-three events, their occurrence rate in humans being lower than in mice and similar to that in rats. In conclusion, this study proposes reliable rules for scoring tibialis anterior electromyogram events during non-rapid eye movement sleep in mice and rats, demonstrating that their physiological time structure is similar to that of healthy young human subjects. These results strengthen the basis for translational rodent models of periodic limb movements during sleep and restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease.",animal| computer-assisted detection| nocturnal myoclonus| normative data| polysomnography| sleep related movement disorders,Animal-other,5,1
1361,23461676,The European journal of neuroscience,Uncovering novel actors in astrocyte-neuron crosstalk in Parkinson's disease: the Wnt/β-catenin signaling cascade as the common final pathway for neuroprotection and self-repair.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neuronal cell bodies in the substantia nigra pars compacta and gliosis. The cause and mechanisms underlying the demise of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons are ill-defined, but interactions between genes and environmental factors are recognized to play a critical role in modulating the vulnerability to PD. Current evidence points to reactive glia as a pivotal factor in PD pathophysiology, playing both protective and destructive roles. Here, the contribution of reactive astrocytes and their ability to modulate DAergic neurodegeneration, neuroprotection and neurorepair in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) rodent model of PD will be discussed in the light of novel emerging evidence implicating wingless-type mouse mammary tumor virus integration site (Wnt)/β-catenin signaling as a strong candidate in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic plasticity. In this work, we highlight an intrinsic Wnt1/frizzled-1/β-catenin tone that critically contributes to the survival and protection of adult midbrain DAergic neurons, with potential implications for drug design or drug action in PD. The dynamic interplay between astrocyte-derived factors and neurogenic signals in MPTP-induced nigrostriatal DAergic neurotoxicity and repair will be summarized, together with recent findings showing a critical role of glia-neural stem/progenitor cell (NPC) interactions aimed at overcoming neurodegeneration and inducing neurorestoration. Understanding the intrinsic plasticity of nigrostriatal DAergic neurons and deciphering the signals facilitating the crosstalk between astrocytes, microglia, DAergic neurons and NPCs may have major implications for the role of stem cell technology in PD, and for identifying potential therapeutic targets to induce endogenous neurorepair.",,Animal-other,5,1

The purpose of this study was to examine whether age-related changes in motor function affected working memory performance in 5xFAD mice in the Hebb-Williams Maze (HWM). At 6 months of age, the 5xFAD mice performed better than the WT (B6SJL) mice on the accelerating rotarod, but much worse at 12 months of age. The 5xFAD and WT mice did not differ in days to acquisition in the HWM at 6 months of age, but the WT mice took longer at 12 months of age. The number of errors increased with maze difficulty and at 6 months of age, the 5xFAD mice made more errors than the WT mice only on difficult problems. At 12 months of age 5xFAD mice made more errors than WT mice at each level of problem difficulty. The latency to solve the problems was higher for the 5xFAD mice than the WT mice in the difficult problems at 6 months of age and in the intermediate problems at 12 months of age. Although body weight had some effect on rotarod performance, there were no systematic effects of motor deficits on either errors or latency measures in the test trials of the HWM. These results indicate that the 5xFAD mice had deficits in working memory in the HWM and that these deficits were not confounded by impaired motor performance.",Alzheimer's disease| Hebb-Williams maze| Long-term memoryAmyloid beta| Motor deficits| Mouse model| Rotarod| Working memory,Animal-other,5,1

The ""neonatal 6-hydroxydopamine"" (6-OHDA) lesion is a commonly used model of ADHD in rat. However, a comprehensive assessment of ADHD-like symptoms is still missing, and data in mouse remain largely unavailable. Our aim was to analyse symptoms of ADHD in the mouse neonatal 6-OHDA model. 6-OHDA mice exhibited the major ADHD-like symptoms, i.e. hyperactivity (open field), attention deficit and impulsivity (five-choice serial reaction time task). Further, the model revealed discrete co-existing symptoms, i.e. anxiety-like (elevated plus maze test) and antisocial (social interaction) behaviours and decreased cognitive functioning (novel object recognition). The efficacy of methylphenidate, a classical psychostimulant used in the treatment of ADHD, was also evaluated. A histological analysis further supports the model validity by indicating dopamine depletion, changes in cortical thickness and abnormalities in anterior cingulate cortex neurons. A principal component analysis of the behaviour profile confirms that the 6-OHDA mouse model displayed good face and predictive validity. We conclude that neonatal dopamine depletion results in behavioural and morphological changes similar to those seen in patients and therefore could be used as a model for studying ADHD pathophysiological mechanisms and identifying therapeutic targets.",,Animal-other,5,1
1364,20593994,Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics,Establishment of a human glioblastoma stemlike brainstem rodent tumor model,"OBJECT: Diffuse brainstem tumors are the most difficult type of pediatric CNS malignancy to treat. These inoperable lesions are treated with radiation alone or in combination with chemotherapy, and the survival rate is less than 10%. It is therefore essential to develop a reliable animal model to screen new therapeutic agents for the treatment of this type of tumor. METHODS: A multipotent human glioblastoma stemlike neurosphere line, 060919, was established from a surgically resected glioblastoma specimen; when cells were implanted intracranially into athymic nude mice, they formed invasive, vascular tumors that exhibited the features of glioblastoma. Ten female Fischer 344 rats received an injection of 75,000 F98 rat glioma cells and 10 female athymic nude rats received an injection of 75,000 060919 human glioblastoma stemlike cells in the pontine tegmentum of the brainstem. A control group of 5 female Fischer rats received an injection of saline in the same location as the animals in the tumor groups. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for survival, and brains were processed postmortem for histopathological investigation. RESULTS: Both F98 cells and 060919 cells grew in 100% of the animals injected. Median survival of animals injected with F98 was 15 days, consistent with the authors' previous reports on the establishment of the brainstem tumor model using the F98 rat glioma line. Median survival of animals injected with 060919 was 31 days. Histopathological analysis of the tumors confirmed the presence of brainstem lesions in animals that received brainstem injections of F98 and in animals that received brainstem injections of 060919. The 060919 brainstem tumors histologically resembled glioblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: Tumor take and median survival were consistent for animals injected in the brainstem with either the established F98 rat glioma cell line or the 060919 human glioblastoma stemlike neurosphere line. Histopathological features of the 060919 brainstem tumors resembled glioblastoma.

However, HD KI mice exhibit milder neuropathological phenotypes and lack overt neurodegeneration. By performing RNA sequencing to compare the gene expression profiles between HD KI pigs and mice, we find that genes related to interleukin-17 (IL-17) signaling are upregulated in the HD pig brains compared to the mouse brains. Delivery of IL-17 into the brain striatum of HD KI mice causes greater reactive gliosis and synaptic deficiency compared to HD KI mice that received PBS. These findings suggest that the upregulation of genes related to IL-17 signaling in HD pig brains contributes to severe glial pathology in HD and identify this as a potential therapeutic target for treating HD.",CP: Immunology| CP: Neuroscience| Huntington's disease| animal models| glial pathology| interleukin-17,Animal-other,5,1

AHF was surgically induced by portocaval shunting followed by hepatic artery ligation 48 hr later. In the infusion group the dose of NH4-Ac, initially 0.78 mmol/kg/hr, was increased every 2 hr by 0.13 mmole/kg/hr during a 10-hour period to simulate the arterial NH3 concentrations observed in AHF. Ammonia levels in rabbits administered the NH4-Ac infusion were identical to those observed in AHF, with the exception of the higher initial value in the AHF group. Moreover, the mean rates of increase in grade of encephalopathy in the two groups were similar, although the EEG grades in the infusion group were significantly less at all time points. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a more pathophysiological approach to identification of the putative toxins in hepatic encephalopathy is feasible. Some of the EEG abnormalities of acute hepatic encephalopathy in rabbits are presumably due to hyperammonemia; the encephalopathy observed in AHF at zero time is probably caused by the previously constructed portocaval shunt via an undefined, but possibly also ammonia-related, mechanism.",,Animal-other,5,1

The inflammatory responses which induce cell apoptosis and necrosis after I/R brain injury lead to a limited process of neural repair. To further comprehend how these targets function in I/R state, we investigated the pathological changes and TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways in vitro and in vivo models of I/R brain injury in this study. Meanwhile, we explored the roles of schisantherin A on I/R brain injury, and whether it exerted neuroprotective effects by regulating the TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways or not. The results showed that schisantherin A significantly reduced the neuronal apoptosis induced by oxygen and glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary culture of rat cortical neurons. Also, schisantherin A alleviated neurological deficits, reduced infarct volume, attenuated oxidation stress, inflammation and apoptosis in ischemic parietal cortex of rats after middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (MCAO/R) injury. Moreover, the activated TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways were inhibited by schisantherin A treatment. In conclusion, TLR4 and C5aR1 played a vital role during I/R brain injury in rats, and schisantherin A exhibited neuroprotective effects by TLR4 and C5aR1 signaling pathways. These findings also provided new insights that would aid in elucidating the effect of schisantherin A against cerebral I/R and support the development of schisantherin A as a potential treatment for ischemic stroke.",Apoptosis| C5aR1| Inflammation| Neuroprotection| Schisantherin A| TLR4,Animal-other,5,1

Accurate identification of microglial populations is key to understanding therapeutic approaches that modify microglial responses to TBI and improve long-term outcome measures. Notably, previous studies often utilized an outdated convention to describe microglial phenotypes. We conducted a temporal analysis of the response to controlled cortical impact (CCI) in rat microglia between ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres across seven time points, identified microglia through expression of activation markers including CD45, CD11b/c, and p2y12 receptor and evaluated their activation state using additional markers of CD32, CD86, RT1B, CD200R, and CD163. We identified unique sub-populations of microglial cells that express individual or combination of activation markers across time points. We further portrayed how the size of these sub-populations changes through time, corresponding to stages in TBI response. We described longitudinal changes in microglial population after CCI in two different locations using activation markers, showing clear separation into cellular sub-populations that feature different temporal patterns of markers after injury. These changes may aid in understanding the symptomatic progression following TBI and help define microglial subpopulations beyond the outdated M1/M2 paradigm.",,Animal-other,5,1

In both the EAE-susceptible and -resistant strains, RT-1B locus-encoded molecules occur at higher surface densities than RT-1D locus molecules. These findings support the theory that genes controlling the induction of MHC expression affect disease susceptibility.",,Animal-other,5,1
1371,22384223,PloS one,In vivo diagnostic imaging using micro-CT: sequential and comparative evaluation of rodent models for hepatic/brain ischemia and stroke,"BACKGROUND: There is an increasing need for animal disease models for pathophysiological research and efficient drug screening. However, one of the technical barriers to the effective use of the models is the difficulty of non-invasive and sequential monitoring of the same animals. Micro-CT is a powerful tool for serial diagnostic imaging of animal models. However, soft tissue contrast resolution, particularly in the brain, is insufficient for detailed analysis, unlike the current applications of CT in the clinical arena. We address the soft tissue contrast resolution issue in this report. METHODOLOGY: We performed contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) on mouse models of experimental cerebral infarction and hepatic ischemia. Pathological changes in each lesion were quantified for two weeks by measuring the lesion volume or the ratio of high attenuation area (%HAA), indicative of increased vascular permeability. We also compared brain images of stroke rats and ischemic mice acquired with micro-CT to those acquired with 11.7-T micro-MRI. Histopathological analysis was performed to confirm the diagnosis by CECT. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the models of cerebral infarction, vascular permeability was increased from three days through one week after surgical initiation, which was also confirmed by Evans blue dye leakage. Measurement of volume and %HAA of the liver lesions demonstrated differences in the recovery process between mice with distinct genetic backgrounds. Comparison of CT and MR images acquired from the same stroke rats or ischemic mice indicated that accuracy of volumetric measurement, as well as spatial and contrast resolutions of CT images, was comparable to that obtained with MRI. The imaging results were also consistent with the histological data. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the CECT scanning method is useful in rodents for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of pathologic lesions in tissues/organs including the brain, and is also suitable for longitudinal observation of the same animals.",,Animal-other,5,1
1372,37749080,Nature communications,Blockade of interferon signaling decreases gut barrier integrity and promotes severe West Nile virus disease.,"The determinants of severe disease caused by West Nile virus (WNV) and why only ~1% of individuals progress to encephalitis remain poorly understood. Here, we use human and mouse enteroids, and a mouse model of pathogenesis, to explore the capacity of WNV to directly infect gastrointestinal (GI) tract cells and contribute to disease severity. At baseline, WNV poorly infects human and mouse enteroid cultures and enterocytes in mice. However, when STAT1 or type I interferon (IFN) responses are absent, GI tract cells become infected, and this is associated with augmented GI tract and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, accumulation of gut-derived molecules in the brain, and more severe WNV disease. The increased gut permeability requires TNF-α signaling, and is absent in WNV-infected IFN-deficient germ-free mice. To link these findings to human disease, we measured auto-antibodies against type I IFNs in serum from WNV-infected human cohorts. A greater frequency of auto- and neutralizing antibodies against IFN-α2 or IFN-ω is present in patients with severe WNV infection, whereas virtually no asymptomatic WNV-infected subjects have such antibodies (odds ratio 24 [95% confidence interval: 3.0 - 192.5; P = 0.003]). Overall, our experiments establish that blockade of type I IFN signaling extends WNV tropism to enterocytes, which correlates with increased gut and BBB permeability, and more severe disease.",,Animal-other,5,1
1373,20460143,Brain research bulletin,Longitudinal analysis of the behavioural phenotype in YAC128 (C57BL/6J) Huntington's disease transgenic mice,"To determine the suitability of mouse models of disease for therapeutic trials, the models must be characterised to determine their similarity to the human condition, and utility for specific therapeutic approaches. The YAC128 mouse model of HD has been bred on to C57BL/6J background in order to provide a mouse model of the disease better suited to behavioural testing, than the visually impaired original line on the FVB background. In the present study, the C57BL/6J YAC128 mice were assessed on several behavioural tasks bi-monthly between 4 and 24 months of age. On the rotarod early and stable deficits were demonstrated in the YAC128 mice from 4 months of age indicating an early abnormality in motor coordination. Early and stable deficits were also found on the balance beam measures of latency to orientate towards the beam and time to traverse it. Measures of fore and hind limb footslips on the balance beam demonstrated early and progressive limb use deficits in the YAC128 mice. On a 3-stage Morris water maze protocol, the YAC128 mice took longer and travelled further to find the hidden platform in each of the 3 locations, indicative of a spatial learning deficit. The YAC128 mice were also less reactive to the primary startle stimuli and the effects of the prepulse which may suggest striatal dysfunction. As a measure of general well being, the body weights of the mice were recorded and demonstrated increased weight in the YAC128 mice until 14 months of age, when they became comparable to that of their wildtype littermates. The YAC128 mouse on the C57BL/6J background has an early, robust and severe behavioural phenotype that shares some similarity to human HD symptomatology.",,Animal-other,5,1
1374,31926295,Neurobiology of disease,Defining molecular identity and fates of CNS-border associated macrophages after ischemic stroke in rodents and humans.,"Central nervous system (CNS)-border associated macrophages (BAMs) maintain their steady-state population during adulthood and are not replaced by circulating monocytes under physiological conditions. Their roles in CNS integrity and functions under pathological conditions remain largely unknown. Until recently, BAMs and microglia could not be unequivocally distinguished due to expression of common macrophage markers. We investigated the transcriptional profiles of immunosorted BAMs from rat sham-operated and ischemic brains using RNA sequencing. We found that BAMs express the distinct transcriptional signature than microglia and infiltrating macrophages. The enrichment of functional groups associated with the cell cycle in CD163[+] cells isolated 3 days after the ischemic injury indicates the proliferative capacity of these cells. The increased number of CD163[+] cells 3 days post-ischemia was corroborated by flow cytometry and detecting the increased number of CD163[+] cells positive for a proliferation marker Ki67 at perivascular spaces. CD163[+] cells in the ischemic brains up-regulated many inflammatory genes and parenchymal CD163+ cells expressed iNOS, which indicates acquisition of a pro-inflammatory phenotype. In mice, BAMs typically express CD206 and we found a subset of these cells expressing CD169. Chimeric mice generated by transplanting bone marrow of donor Cx3cr1[gfp]CCR2[rfp] mice to wild type hosts showed an increased number of CX3CR1[+]CD169[+] perivascular macrophages 3 days post-ischemia. Furthermore, these cells accumulated in the brain parenchyma and we detected replacement of perivascular macrophages by peripheral monocytic cells in the sub-acute phase of stroke. In line with the animal results, post-mortem brain samples from human ischemic stroke cases showed time-dependent accumulation of CD163[+] cells in the ischemic parenchyma. Our findings indicate a unique transcriptional signature of BAMs, their local proliferation and migration of inflammatory BAMs to the brain parenchyma after stroke in animal models and humans.",CNS border associated macrophages| Chimeric mice| Human ischemic stroke| Ischemia| RNA-sequencing,Animal-other,5,1
1375,6891758,Neurotoxicology,Neurotoxicity of methylmercury in the pigeon.,"Pigeons repeatedly exposed to sublethal doses of methylmercury (5-10 mg Hg/kg/wk, po, for 34-77 days) exhibited marked behavioral changes that were accompanied by only minor evidence of neuropathologic changes at the light microscopic level. Accuracy and rate of pecking for grain declined while food intake remained unchanged. Methylmercury produced permanent changes in posture and in motor coordination. The regional distribution of methylmercury within the nervous system was poorly correlated with the distribution of pathologic changes. Overt behavioral signs appeared after the brain accumulated more than about 12 to 16 ppm Hg. Data with pigeons support earlier evidence that the dose-response function for methylmercury is modulated by dose rate and duration of exposure, since the pattern of blood and tissue distribution of Hg is established in advance of the appearance of signs. The pigeon is more sensitive to methylmercury than are mice and rats, but less sensitive than primates.",,Animal-other,5,1

However, the lack of comprehensive and high-quality GEMs for model organisms restricts translational utilization of omics data accumulating from the use of various disease models. Here we present a unified platform of GEMs that covers five major model animals, including Mouse1 (Mus musculus), Rat1 (Rattus norvegicus), Zebrafish1 (Danio rerio), Fruitfly1 (Drosophila melanogaster), and Worm1 (Caenorhabditis elegans). These GEMs represent the most comprehensive coverage of the metabolic network by considering both orthology-based pathways and species-specific reactions. All GEMs can be interactively queried via the accompanying web portal Metabolic Atlas. Specifically, through integrative analysis of Mouse1 with RNA-sequencing data from brain tissues of transgenic mice we identified a coordinated up-regulation of lysosomal GM2 ganglioside and peptide degradation pathways which appears to be a signature metabolic alteration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models with a phenotype of amyloid precursor protein overexpression. This metabolic shift was further validated with proteomics data from transgenic mice and cerebrospinal fluid samples from human patients. The elevated lysosomal enzymes thus hold potential to be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of AD. Taken together, we foresee that this evolving open-source platform will serve as an important resource to facilitate the development of systems medicines and translational biomedical applications.",Alzheimer’s disease| Aβ deposition| animal model| genome-scale model| translational medicine,Animal-other,5,1

The gerbil was connected to the 2 channel fluorometer/reflectometer by flexible light guides implanted above the two hemispheres of the brain.

1378,16000159,Journal of neurochemistry,Blockade of L-type voltage-gated Ca channel inhibits ischemia-induced neurogenesis by down-regulating iNOS expression in adult mouse.,"Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian hippocampus may contribute to repairing the brain after injury. The signals that regulate neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus following ischemic stroke insult are not well known. We have previously reported that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression is necessary for ischemia-stimulated neurogenesis in the adult dentate gyrus. Here, we show that mice subjected to 90 min of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) significantly increased the number of new neurons and up-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus. Blockade of the L-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channel (L-VGCC) prevented neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and subventricular zone (SVZ), and down-regulated iNOS expression in the dentate gyrus after cerebral ischemia. This study suggests that Ca(2+) influx through L-VGCC is involved in ischemia-induced neurogenesis by up-regulating iNOS expression.",,Animal-other,5,1

Understanding the role IEDs have on the hippocampal circuit is important for our understanding of the cognitive deficits seen in epilepsy and AD. We characterize and compare the IEDs of human epilepsy patients from microwire hippocampal recording with those of AD transgenic mice with implanted multilayer hippocampal silicon probes. Both the local field potential features and firing patterns of pyramidal cells and interneurons were similar in the mouse and human. We found that as IEDs emerged from the CA3-1 circuits, they recruited pyramidal cells and silenced interneurons, followed by post-IED suppression. IEDs suppressed the incidence and altered the properties of physiological sharp-wave ripples, altered their physiological properties, and interfered with the replay of place field sequences in a maze. In addition, IEDs in AD mice inversely correlated with daily memory performance. Together, our work implies that IEDs may present a common and epilepsy-independent phenomenon in neurodegenerative diseases that perturbs hippocampal-cortical communication and interferes with memory.",Alzheimer model| interictal epileptiform discharges| memory| replay| sharp wave ripples,Animal-other,5,1
1380,16928182,Journal of neurotrauma,Differential behavioral and histopathological responses to graded cortical impact injury in mice.,"Controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury, a model of contusive brain injury in humans, is being used with increasing frequency in mice to investigate post-traumatic cell damage and death and to evaluate treatment strategies. Because cellular injury mechanisms and therapeutic approaches may depend on the severity of the initial insult, it is important to utilize a model in which outcomes are sensitive to injury severity. Adult male C57Bl/6 mice were anesthetized and subjected to sham injury (n = 23) or CCI injury at either 0.5 mm (n = 22) or 1.0 mm (n = 22) depth of impact at a velocity of 5 m/sec. At 2 days, brain-injured mice exhibited significant memory (p < 0.05) and motor function (p < 0.001) deficits compared to sham-injured mice; furthermore, mice subjected to an impact of 1.0 mm were significantly more impaired in both outcome measures than those injured at 0.5 mm (p < 0.05). The cortical lesion increased in size between 24 h and 7 days in both injury groups, but was significantly larger in the 1.0 mm group. Hippocampal cell loss was observed in the hilar and CA3 regions in both groups, and in the CA1 and dentate granule cell layers in the 1.0 mm group. Regional patterns of IgG extravasation and reactive astrocytosis were similar in the two injured groups, but changes were more persistent in the 1.0 mm group. Both levels of injury resulted in acute loss of neuronal MAP-2 immunoreactivity in the cortex and sub-region specific changes in the hippocampus. Thus, increasing the depth of impact led to similar structural alterations in neurons, astrocytes and the vasculature, but resulted in greater behavioral deficits and cortical and hippocampal cell death.",,Animal-other,5,1

Chronic haloperidol administration to rats with bifrontal cortical ablations produced 15 to 20 movements per minute that persisted for 7 weeks after drug withdrawal. Drugs given to decrease dopaminergic, cholinergic, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic neurotransmission suppressed the movements, whereas cholinergic agonists increased them.

However, little is known about the physiological brain region- and cell type-specific HTT expression pattern in wild type mice and a potential recruitment of endogenous HTT to other pathogenic protein aggregates such as amyloid plaques in cross seeding events. Employing a monoclonal anti-HTT antibody directed against the HTT mid-region and using brain tissue of three different mouse strains, we detected prominent immunoreactivity in a number of brain areas, particularly in cholinergic cranial nerve nuclei, while ubiquitous neuronal staining appeared faint. The region-specific distribution of endogenous HTT was found to be comparable in wild type rat and hamster brain. In human amyloid precursor protein transgenic Tg2576 mice with amyloid plaque pathology, similar neuronal HTT expression patterns and a distinct association of HTT with Abeta plaques were revealed by immunohistochemical double labelling. Additionally, the localization of HTT in reactive astrocytes was demonstrated for the first time in a transgenic Alzheimer's disease animal model. Both, plaque association of HTT and occurrence in astrocytes appeared to be age-dependent. Astrocytic HTT gene and protein expression was confirmed in primary cultures by RT-qPCR and by immunocytochemistry. We provide the first detailed analysis of physiological HTT expression in rodent brain and, under pathological conditions, demonstrate HTT aggregation in proximity to Abeta plaques and Abeta-induced astrocytic expression of endogenous HTT in Tg2576 mice.",Alzheimer’s disease| Amyloid precursor protein| Animal model| Astrocytes| Cranial nerve nuclei| Huntingtin,Animal-other,5,1

Some strains of mice and rats are susceptible to audiogenic seizures without priming and these have been used as good experimental models with which to study epilepsies. Here we identified Vlgr1d and Vlgr1e, novel alternatively-spliced variants of Vlgr1b/MGR1, which, upon sequence analysis, were shown to be transcripts from a locus previously characterized as mass1. Vlgr1 (Vlgr1b, Vlgr1d and Vlgr1e) mRNA is expressed predominantly in the neuroepithelium of the developing mouse brain. Our protein-tagged experiment suggested that Vlgr1d and Vlgr1e are secretory molecules, while Vlgr1b is a receptor. Knockout mice lacking exons 2-4 of Vlgr1 were susceptible to audiogenic seizures without priming, although there were no apparent histological abnormalities in their brains. Ninety-five percent of these knockout mice exhibited wild running, a feature typical of the preconvulsive phase of audiogenic seizures triggered by loud noise (11 kHz, 105 dB), and 68% exhibited tonic convulsions at 3 weeks after birth. Our monogenic mice, which have a unique genetic background, serve as a useful tool for further studies on seizures.",,Animal-other,5,1
1384,18634851,Neuroscience letters,Deletion of both ICAM-1 and C3 enhances severity of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis compared to C3-deficient mice.,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by central nervous system (CNS) inflammation and leukocyte infiltration, demyelination of neurons, and blood-brain barrier breakdown. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal model for MS is dependent on a number of components of the immune system including complement and adhesion molecules. Previous studies in our lab have examined the role of C3, the central complement component, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) a key cell adhesion molecule involved in leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation including the CNS. In these studies we demonstrated that myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE is markedly attenuated in both ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) mice. Given the pivotal role that these proteins play in EAE, we hypothesized that EAE in ICAM-1(-/-) and C3(-/-) double mutant mice would likely fail to develop. Unexpectedly, EAE in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice was only modestly attenuated compared to wild type mice and significantly worse than C3(-/-) mice. Leukocyte infiltration was commensurate with disease severity between the three groups of mice. Spinal cord T cells from ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice produced the highest levels of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha, despite reduced disease severity compared to wild type mice. The mechanisms behind the elevated EAE severity in ICAM-1(-/-)xC3(-/-) mice may relate to altered homing of leukocytes or processing of self-antigens in the double mutant background.",,Animal-other,5,1

Propionic acid (PPA) is a short chain fatty acid, a metabolic end-product of enteric bacteria in the gut, and a common food preservative. Recent evidence indicates that PPA can cause behavioral abnormalities and a neuroinflammatory response in rats. Social behavior was examined in similarly-treated pairs of adult male Long-Evans rats placed in an open field following intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of PPA (4 microl of 0.26 M solution) or control compounds. Behavior was analyzed using both the EthoVision behavior tracking system and by blind scoring of videotapes of social behaviors. Compared to controls, rats treated with PPA displayed social behavior impairments as indicated by significantly greater mean distance apart, reduced time spent in close proximity, reduced playful interaction, and altered responses to playful initiations. Treatment with another short chain fatty acid, sodium acetate, produced similar impairments, but treatment with the alcohol analog of PPA, 1-propanol, did not produce impairments. Immunohistochemical analysis of brain tissue taken from rats treated with PPA revealed reactive astrogliosis, indicating a neuroinflammatory response. These findings suggest that PPA can change both brain and behavior in the laboratory rat in a manner that is consistent with symptoms of human ASD.",,Animal-other,5,1

Although the knockout (KO) of the Fmr1 gene homolog in mice is primarily used for elucidating the neurobiological substrate of FXS, there is limited association of the experimental data with the pathophysiological condition in humans. The use of Fmr1 KO rats offers additional translational validity in this regard. Therefore, we employed a multi-level approach to study the behavioral profile and the glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission status in pathophysiology-associated brain structures of Fmr1 KO rats, including the recordings of evoked and spontaneous field potentials from hippocampal slices, paralleled with next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that these rats exhibit hyperactivity and cognitive deficits, along with characteristic bidirectional glutamatergic and GABAergic alterations in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. These results are coupled to affected excitability and local inhibitory processes in the hippocampus, along with a specific transcriptional profile, highlighting dysregulated hippocampal network activity in KO rats. Overall, our data provide novel insights concerning the biobehavioral profile of FmR1 KO rats and translationally upscales our understanding on pathophysiology and symptomatology of FXS syndrome.",,Animal-other,5,1

In addition, ocular pain following corneal injury is frequently observed in clinic. The aim of the study was to characterize the peripheral and central neuroinflammatory process in the trigeminal pathways in response to cornea alteration induced by chronic topical instillations of 0.2% benzalkonium chloride (BAC) in male C57BL/6J mice. In vitro BAC induced neurotoxicity and increases neuronal (FOS, ATF3) and pro-inflammatory (IL-6) markers in primary mouse trigeminal ganglion culture. BAC-treated mice exhibited 7days after the treatment reduced aqueous tear production and increased inflammatory cell infiltration in the cornea. Hypertonic saline-evoked eye wipe behavior was enhanced in BAC-treated animals that exhibited increased FOS, ATF3 and Iba1 immunoreactivity in the trigeminal ganglion. Ocular inflammation is associated with a significant increase in IL-6 and TNF-α mRNA expression in the trigeminal ganglion. We reported a strong increase in FOS and Iba1 positive cells in particular in the sensory trigeminal complex at the ipsilateral interpolaris/caudalis (Vi/Vc) transition and Vc/upper cervical cord (Vc/C1) regions. In addition, activated microglial cells were tightly wrapped around activated FOS neurons in both regions and phosphorylated p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase was markedly enhanced specifically in microglial cells during ocular inflammation. Similar data were obtained in the facial motor nucleus. These neuroanatomical data correlated with the increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory (TNF-α, IL-6, CCL2) and neuronal (FOS and ATF3) markers. Interestingly, the suppression of corneal inflammation 10days following the end of BAC treatment resulted in a marked attenuation of peripheral and central changes observed in pathological conditions. This study provides the first demonstration that corneal inflammation induces activation of neurons and microglial p38 MAPK pathway within sensory trigeminal complex. These results suggest that this altered activity in intracellular signaling caused by ocular inflammation might play a priming role in the central sensitization of ocular related brainstem circuits, which represents a significant factor in ocular pain development.",Benzalkonium chloride| Corneal neurons| Facial motor nucleus| Neuroinflammation| Ocular pain| Trigeminal complex,Animal-other,5,1

In this report, the differentiation capacity in vivo of these cells was analysed following a standardized trauma. Before the trauma, the subependymal cells expressed nestin but not the astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neurofilament respectively. In response to injury, the majority of the subependymal cells coexpressed nestin and GFAP, but never nestin and neurofilament. Furthermore, cells coexpressing nestin and GFAP were found progressively further away from the subependyma and closer to the lesion at later time points after the injury, indicating that these cells migrate towards the lesion. Nestin was in addition re-expressed in reactive astrocytes near the lesion and in non-reactive astrocytes very far from the lesion throughout the ipsilateral cortex. In conclusion, our data indicate that the nestin-positive subependymal cells are an in vivo source for the generation of new astrocytes but not neurons after injury, and that nestin re-expression in astrocytes following traumatic stimuli can be used as a sensitive marker for astroglial activation.",,Animal-other,5,1

By use of an experimental protocol in which cycling of [3H]Ins is inhibited and resynthesis occurs with unlabelled Ins only, we were able to measure specifically the effects of TRH on the hydrolysis of the Ins lipids present before stimulation. A maximally effective dose of TRH (1 microM) caused a time-dependent decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids that attained a steady-state value of 42 +/- 1% of the initial level between 1.5 and 2 h. After 2 h, even though there was no further decrease in 3H-labelled Ins lipids, and no increase in [3H]Ins or [3H]Ins phosphates, turnover of Ins lipids, as assessed as incorporation of [32P]Pi into PtdIns, continued at a rate similar to that in cells incubated without LiCl or unlabelled Ins. These data indicate that Ins lipid turnover was not desensitized during prolonged TRH stimulation. Depletion of lipid 3H radioactivity by TRH occurred at higher TRH doses on addition of the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide. Addition of 1 microM-TRH after 3 h of stimulation by a sub-maximal (0.3 nM) TRH dose caused a further decrease in 3H radioactivity to the minimum level (40% of initial value). We propose that the TRH-responsive pool of Ins lipids in GH3 cells is composed of the complement of Ins lipids that are within functional proximity of activated TRH-receptor complexes.",,Animal-other,5,1
1391,25867960,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,The forced swim test as a model of depressive-like behavior,"The goal of the present protocol is to describe the forced swim test (FST), which is one of the most commonly used assays for the study of depressive-like behavior in rodents. The FST is based on the assumption that when placing an animal in a container filled with water, it will first make efforts to escape but eventually will exhibit immobility that may be considered to reflect a measure of behavioral despair. This test has been extensively used because it involves the exposure of the animals to stress, which was shown to have a role in the tendency for major depression. Additionally, the FST has been shown to share some of the factors that are influenced or altered by depression in humans, including changes in food consumption, sleep abnormalities and drug-withdrawal-induced anhedonia. The main advantages of this procedure are that it is relatively easy to perform and that its results are easily and quickly analyzed. Moreover, its sensitivity to a broad range of antidepressant drugs that makes it a suitable screening test is one of the most important features leading to its high predictive validity. Despite its appeal, this model has a number of disadvantages. First, the issue of chronic augmentation is problematic in this test because in real life patients need to be treated for at least several weeks before they experience any relief from their symptoms. Last, due to the aversiveness of the FST, it is important to take into account possible influences it might have on brain structure/function if brain analyses are to be carried out following this procedure.",,Animal-other,5,1

Levels and phosphorylation state of ERK, cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and proline-rich/Ca2+-activated tyrosine kinase (PYK2), and levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), were determined using western blotting. C57Bl/6J mice received acute or chronic nicotine (200 microg/mL) in their drinking water or were withdrawn from nicotine for 24 h following chronic exposure. CREB phosphorylation was reduced in the nucleus accumbens following chronic nicotine, consistent with previous reports that decreased accumbens CREB activity increases drug reinforcement. In contrast, CREB phosphorylation was increased in the prefrontal cortex following chronic nicotine exposure and in the ventral tegmental area during nicotine withdrawal. In addition, total and phosphorylated ERK decreased in the amygdala following chronic nicotine exposure, but ERK phosphorylation increased in the prefrontal cortex. TH levels increased in both the amygdala and prefrontal cortex, supporting the hypothesis that increased catecholaminergic tone contributes to nicotine reinforcement.

A total of 60 male Wistar rats were randomly distributed into four groups: Nourished/Control (NC, n=15), Nourished/Cerebral Palsy (NCP, n=15); Undernourished/Control (UC, n=15) and Undernourished/Cerebral Palsy (UCP, n=15). Animals of cerebral palsy (CP) group were subjected to an experimental model based on the combination of perinatal anoxia associated with sensorimotor restriction of the hindlimb. In the rats were evaluated body weight gain, intake of breast milk, feed post-weaning consumption, parameters of the chewing, intra-oral sensitivity and muscle properties (muscle weight and distribution of types of fibers) of the masseter and digastric. Animals from undernourished CP group showed greater reduction in most data evaluated including body weight (P<0.05), food intake post-weaning (P<0.05), frequency of chewing cycles (P<0.05), duration of the reactions of 'taste' (P<0.05), muscle weight and decrease of the proportion of type IIB fibers in the masseter muscle (P<0.05). These results demonstrated in rats submitted a cerebral palsy that perinatal undernutrition intensifies the damage in morphological and functional parameters of chewing.",,Animal-other,5,1
1394,11771945,Experimental neurology,Changes in dopaminergic and glutamatergic excitatory mechanisms of micturition reflex after middle cerebral artery occlusion in conscious rats.,"Previous reports have shown that N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic and D2 dopaminergic mechanisms have independent excitatory effects on bladder activity in normal and cerebral infarcted (CI) rats under urethane anesthesia. The study presented here was undertaken to investigate the interaction between these two mechanisms on bladder activity in conscious Sprague-Dawley female rats with or without cerebral infarction. Occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery or a sham operation (SO) was performed under halothane anesthesia. After recovery from the anesthesia, bladder activity was monitored continuously by means of infusion cystometrography in awake rats. The effects of cumulative intravenous doses of quinpirole (0.001-1 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor agonist, were studied in awake SO and CI rats with or without dizocilpine (10 mg/kg) pretreatment. The effects of dizocilpine (1 or 10 mg/kg) were also examined in other SO or CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole. Bladder capacity in CI rats was significantly smaller (0.18 ml) than that in SO rats (0.48 ml). Quinpirole (0.1 and 1 mg/kg) further reduced bladder capacity in both types of rats, an effect blocked by sulpiride (20 mg/kg), a D2 dopamine receptor antagonist. The effect of quinpirole was also antagonized by dizocilpine (1 mg/kg) to a significantly (P < 0.01) greater degree in CI than in SO rats. In SO rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, dizocilpine significantly increased bladder capacity in a dose-dependent manner. After the maximum dose (10 mg/kg) of dizocilpine, sulpiride did not produce any changes in bladder activity. In CI rats pretreated with 1 mg/kg of quinpirole, 1 mg/kg of dizocilpine increased bladder capacity. After administration of the maximum dose of dizocilpine (10 mg/kg), which did not produce an additional effect, sulpiride (20 mg/kg) increased bladder capacity by 58.3%. These results indicate that in awake rats D2 dopaminergic excitatory effects on the urinary bladder are mediated in part by NMDA glutamatergic mechanisms and in part by non-NMDA mechanisms. The latter type was more prominent in CI rats, indicating that the bladder hyperactivity induced by cerebral infarction may be mediated by an alteration in dopaminergic-glutamatergic interactions in the brain.",,Animal-other,5,1
1395,31272300,Veterinary pathology,Spontaneous Incidental Brain Lesions in C57BL/6J Mice.,"Genetically engineered mouse lines on a C57BL/6J background are widely employed as preclinical models to study neurodegenerative human disorders and brain tumors. However, because of the lack of comprehensive data on the spontaneous background neuropathology of the C57BL/6J strain, discriminating between naturally occurring changes and lesions caused by experimental mutations can be challenging. In this context, this study aims at defining the spectrum and frequency of spontaneous brain changes in a large cohort of C57BL/6J mice and their association with specific biological variables, including age and sex. Brains from 203 experimentally naive and clinically unremarkable C57BL/6J mice were collected and analyzed by means of histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Mice ranged in age from 3 to 110 weeks with 89 females, 111 males, and 3 unknowns. Sixteen different spontaneous lesion categories were described in this cohort. Age-related neurodegenerative and/or neuroinflammatory findings represented the most common pathologic changes and included (1) Hirano-like inclusions in the thalamic neurons, (2) neuroaxonal dystrophy in the medulla oblongata, (3) periodic acid-Schiff-positive granular deposits in the neuropil of the hippocampus, and (4) progressive neuroinflammation characterized by microgliosis and astrogliosis. Neoplastic conditions, developmental abnormalities, and circulatory disorders were rarely observed incidental findings. In conclusion, this study describes spontaneous age-related brain lesions of the C57BL/6J mouse and provides a reference for evaluating and interpreting the neuropathological phenotype in genetically engineered mouse models developed and maintained on this congenic background.",C57BL/6J| Hirano bodies| aging| background lesions| brain| gliosis| inclusion bodies| mice| neuroaxonal dystrophy,Animal-other,5,1
1396,8102036,The American journal of physiology,Autonomic control of pancreatic polypeptide and glucagon secretion during neuroglucopenia and hypoglycemia in mice.,"Neural control of pancreatic polypeptide (PP) release has not been previously investigated in the mouse. In addition, it is not known to what extent increased glucagon secretion during hypoglycemia in mice is neurally mediated vs. an effect of hypoglycemia to directly stimulate glucagon secretion at the level of the islet. Feeding or the cholinergic agonist carbachol increased plasma PP levels in conscious mice (+74 +/- 18 pg/ml vs. fasted mice and +141 +/- 17 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). Neuroglucopenia induced by 2-deoxy-D-glucose or insulin-induced hypoglycemia also increased plasma PP (+79 +/- 18 and +89 +/- 11 pg/ml vs. control, respectively). These increases were abolished by hexamethonium and reduced by atropine methylnitrate (atropine). Hypoglycemia-induced hyperglucagonemia (+1,243 +/- 275 pg/ml) was reduced to 31 +/- 7% of control by atropine (+382 +/- 85 pg/ml), to 48 +/- 9% of control by combined adrenergic blockade (+601 +/- 112 pg/ml), and nearly abolished by atropine plus combined blockade (+143 +/- 41 pg/ml; 11 +/- 3% of control) or hexamethonium (+151 +/- 38 pg/ml; 12 +/- 3% of control). We conclude the following in the mouse. 1) Feeding or cholinergic agonists increase plasma PP. 2) During neuroglucopenia or hypoglycemia, plasma PP is increased via nicotinic and muscarinic mechanisms. 3) The glucagon response to hypoglycemia is predominantly the result of autonomic activation and is mediated by both muscarinic and adrenergic mechanisms.",,Animal-other,5,1
1397,34127752,Scientific reports,In vivo multi-parametric manganese-enhanced MRI for detecting amyloid plaques in rodent models of Alzheimer's disease,"Amyloid plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that develop in its earliest stages. Thus, non-invasive detection of these plaques would be invaluable for diagnosis and the development and monitoring of treatments, but this remains a challenge due to their small size. Here, we investigated the utility of manganese-enhanced MRI (MEMRI) for visualizing plaques in transgenic rodent models of AD across two species: 5xFAD mice and TgF344-AD rats. Animals were given subcutaneous injections of MnCl(2) and imaged in vivo using a 9.4 T Bruker scanner. MnCl(2) improved signal-to-noise ratio but was not necessary to detect plaques in high-resolution images. Plaques were visible in all transgenic animals and no wild-types, and quantitative susceptibility mapping showed that they were more paramagnetic than the surrounding tissue. This, combined with beta-amyloid and iron staining, indicate that plaque MR visibility in both animal models was driven by plaque size and iron load. Longitudinal relaxation rate mapping revealed increased manganese uptake in brain regions of high plaque burden in transgenic animals compared to their wild-type littermates. This was limited to the rhinencephalon in the TgF344-AD rats, while it was most significantly increased in the cortex of the 5xFAD mice. Alizarin Red staining suggests that manganese bound to plaques in 5xFAD mice but not in TgF344-AD rats. Multi-parametric MEMRI is a simple, viable method for detecting amyloid plaques in rodent models of AD. Manganese-induced signal enhancement can enable higher-resolution imaging, which is key to visualizing these small amyloid deposits. We also present the first in vivo evidence of manganese as a potential targeted contrast agent for imaging plaques in the 5xFAD model of AD.",,Animal-other,5,1
1398,24423792,Disease models & mechanisms,Early motor deficits in mouse disease models are reliably uncovered using an automated home-cage wheel-running system: a cross-laboratory validation,"Deficits in motor function are debilitating features in disorders affecting neurological, neuromuscular and musculoskeletal systems. Although these disorders can vary greatly with respect to age of onset, symptomatic presentation, rate of progression and severity, the study of these disease models in mice is confined to the use of a small number of tests, most commonly the rotarod test. To expand the repertoire of meaningful motor function tests in mice, we tested, optimised and validated an automated home-cage-based running-wheel system, incorporating a conventional wheel with evenly spaced rungs and a complex wheel with particular rungs absent. The system enables automated assessment of motor function without handler interference, which is desirable in longitudinal studies involving continuous monitoring of motor performance. In baseline studies at two test centres, consistently significant differences in performance on both wheels were detectable among four commonly used inbred strains. As further validation, we studied performance in mutant models of progressive neurodegenerative diseases--Huntington's disease [TgN(HD82Gln)81Dbo; referred to as HD mice] and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [Tg(SOD1G93A)(dl)1/GurJ; referred to as SOD1 mice]--and in a mutant strain with subtle gait abnormalities, C-Snap25(Bdr)/H (Blind-drunk, Bdr). In both models of progressive disease, as with the third mutant, we could reliably and consistently detect specific motor function deficits at ages far earlier than any previously recorded symptoms in vivo: 7-8 weeks for the HD mice and 12 weeks for the SOD1 mice. We also conducted longitudinal analysis of rotarod and grip strength performance, for which deficits were still not detectable at 12 weeks and 23 weeks, respectively. Several new parameters of motor behaviour were uncovered using principal component analysis, indicating that the wheel-running assay could record features of motor function that are independent of rotarod performance. This represents a powerful new method to detect motor deficits at pre-symptomatic stages in mouse disease models and should be considered as a valid tool to investigate the efficacy of therapeutic agents.",Complex wheel| Motor function| Neurodegenerative disease,Animal-other,5,1
1399,24009395,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",A causative link between inner ear defects and long-term striatal dysfunction.,"There is a high prevalence of behavioral disorders that feature hyperactivity in individuals with severe inner ear dysfunction. What remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior. Using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissue-specific mutations of Slc12a2, we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate response element-binding protein (pCREB) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (pERK), key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity. Hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the pERK inhibitor SL327. These findings reveal that a sensory impairment, such as inner ear dysfunction, can induce specific molecular changes in the brain that cause maladaptive behaviors, such as hyperactivity, that have been traditionally considered exclusively of cerebral origin.",,Animal-other,5,1

Its pathophysiology remains unclear. PANDAS has been proposed to result from cross-reactivity of antibodies raised against GABHS with brain antigens, but the targets of these antibodies are unclear and may be heterogeneous. We developed an in vivo assay in mice to characterize the cellular targets of antibodies in serum from individuals with PANDAS. We focus on striatal interneurons, which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of tic disorders. Sera from children with well-characterized PANDAS (n = 5) from a previously described clinical trial (NCT01281969), and matched controls, were infused into the striatum of mice; antibody binding to interneurons was characterized using immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Antibodies from children with PANDAS bound to ∼80% of cholinergic interneurons, significantly higher than the <50% binding seen with matched healthy controls. There was no elevated binding to two different populations of GABAergic interneurons (PV and nNOS-positive), confirming the specificity of this phenomenon. Elevated binding to cholinergic interneurons resolved in parallel with symptom improvement after treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin. Antibody-mediated dysregulation of striatal cholinergic interneurons may be a locus of pathology in PANDAS. Future clarification of the functional consequences of this specific binding may identify new opportunities for intervention in children with this condition.",Animal model| Antibody| Autoimmunity| Interneurons| Obsessive-compulsive disorder| PANDAS| Tics,Animal-other,5,1
1401,27191407,Appetite,Running induces nausea in rats: Kaolin intake generated by voluntary and forced wheel running.,"Three experiments were conducted showing rats' pica behavior (kaolin clay intake) due to running in activity wheels. The amount of kaolin consumed was a positive function of the available time of voluntary running (20, 40, or 60 min), although this relationship was blunted by a descending (i.e., 60 → 40 → 20 min) test series of execution (Experiment 1). Pica was also generated by forced running in a motorized wheel for 60 min as a positive function of the speed of wheel rotations at 98, 185, or 365 m/h, independent of the order of execution (Experiment 2). Voluntary running generated more pica than did forced running at 80 m/h, although the distance travelled in the former condition was 27% lesser than that in the latter condition (Experiment 3). Because kaolin intake is regarded as a reliable measure of nausea in rats, these results show that wheel running, either voluntary or forced, induces nausea in rats.",Kaolin| Pica| Rats| Wheel running,Animal-other,5,1

We have considered the possibility that portasystemic shunting may be a factor determining the organ distribution of copper in patients with liver disease. Thirty-two Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into a sham-operated group, and a group subjected to partial occlusion of the portal vein (PPVO). Half the rats in each group were fed on normal diet and the remainder had copper added to the drinking water. Rats subjected to PPVO developed large portasystemic shunts. Over a 3-month period, none of the groups showed an increase in serum copper concentrations, or copper oxidase levels. Liver and kidney copper concentrations were similarly increased in copper supplemented sham-operated and PPVO rats, but brain copper content in both groups was similar to the unsupplemented controls. In neither unsupplemented nor copper supplemented rats subjected to PPVO, was the organ distribution of copper different from sham-operated controls. This study suggests that portasystemic shunting does not alter the organ distribution, or tissue concentration of copper.",,Animal-other,5,1
1403,15292181,The Journal of biological chemistry,Proliferation of neointimal smooth muscle cells after arterial injury. Dependence on interactions between fibroblast growth factor receptor-2 and fibroblast growth factor-9.,"The growth factor signaling mechanisms responsible for neointimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and accumulation, a characteristic feature of many vascular pathologies that can lead to restenosis after angioplasty, remain to be identified. Here, we examined the contribution of fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs) 2 and 3 as well as novel fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) to such proliferation. Balloon catheter injury to the rat carotid artery stimulated the expression of two distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms, differing only by the presence or absence of the acidic box, and two distinctly spliced FGFR-3 isoforms containing the acidic box and differing only by the presence of either the IIIb or IIIc exon. Post-injury arterial administration of recombinant adenoviruses expressing dominant negative mutant forms of these FGFRs were used to assess the roles of the endogenous FGFR isoforms in neointimal SMC proliferation. Dominant negative FGFR-2 containing the acidic box inhibited such proliferation by 40%, whereas the dominant negative FGFR-3 forms had little effect. Expression of FGF-9, known to be capable of binding to all four neointimal FGFR-2/-3 isoforms, was abundant within the neointima. FGF-9 markedly stimulated both the proliferation of neointimal SMCs and the activation of extracellular signal-related kinases 1/2, effects which were abrogated by the administration of antisense FGF-9 oligonucleotides to injured arteries and the expression of the dominant negative FGFR-2 adenovirus in cultured neointimal SMCs. These studies demonstrate that, although multiple FGFRs are induced in neointimal SMCs following arterial injury, specific interactions between distinctly spliced FGFR-2 isoforms and FGF-9 contribute to the proliferation of these SMCs.",,Animal-other,5,1
1404,34017692,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,CX(3)CL1 Recruits NK Cells Into the Central Nervous System and Aggravates Brain Injury of Mice Caused by Angiostrongylus cantonensis Infection,"BACKGROUND: Angiostrongylus cantonensis (A. cantonensis), is a food-borne zoonotic parasite that can cause central nervous system (CNS) injury characterized by eosinophilic meningitis. However, the pathogenesis of angiostrongylosis remains elusive. Natural killer cells (NK cells) are unique innate lymphocytes important in early defense against pathogens. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of NK cells in A. cantonensis infection and to elucidate the key factors that recruit NK cells into the CNS. METHODS: Mouse model of A. cantonensis infection was established by intragastric administration of third-stage larvae. The expression of cytokines and chemokines at gene and protein levels was analyzed by qRT-PCR and ELISA. Distribution of NK cells was observed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against YAC-1 cells was detected by LDH release assay. The ability of NK cells to secrete cytokines was determined by intracellular flow cytometry and ELISA. Depletion and adoptive transfer of NK cells in vivo was induced by tail vein injection of anti-asialo GM1 rabbit serum and purified splenic NK cells, respectively. CX(3)CL1 neutralization experiment was performed by intraperitoneal injection of anti-CX(3)CL1 rat IgG. RESULTS: The infiltration of NK cells in the CNS of A. cantonensis-infected mice was observed from 14 dpi and reached the peak on 18 and 22 dpi. Compared with uninfected splenic NK cells, the CNS-infiltrated NK cells of infected mice showed enhanced cytotoxicity and increased IFN-γ and TNF-α production ability. Depletion of NK cells alleviated brain injury, whereas adoptive transfer of NK cells exacerbated brain damage in A. cantonensis-infected mice. The expression of CX(3)CL1 in the brain tissue and its receptor CX(3)CR1 on the CNS-infiltrated NK cells were both elevated after A. cantonensis infection. CX(3)CL1 neutralization reduced the percentage and absolute number of the CNS-infiltrated NK cells and relieved brain damage caused by A. cantonensis infection. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the up-regulated CX(3)CL1 in the brain tissue recruits NK cells into the CNS and aggravates brain damage caused by A. cantonensis infection. The findings improve the understanding of the pathogenesis of angiostrongyliasis and expand the therapeutic intervention in CNS disease.",Angiostrongylus cantonensis| CX3CL1| NK cells| brain injury| central nervous system| infection,Animal-other,5,1

The CNTNAP2 knockout (KO) rat model, rats without the CNTNAP2 gene, exhibits deficits in social interaction and increases in both repetitive and anxiety-like behaviors. However, deficits in time perception that may underlie several of the neuropsychological disorders implicated have not been investigated. The current study investigated timing in CNTNAP2 KO rats compared to control rats using a discrete-trial temporal bisection task. Results suggested deficits in the timing of relatively long durations in the CNTNAP2 KO rats. This finding is consistent with similar findings previously reported in humans diagnosed with ASD, and is promising for understanding the role that the CNTNAP2 gene may play in timing in certain neuropsychological disorders, and for developing targeted clinical therapies.",Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)| CNTNAP2| Rats| Time perception| Timing,Animal-other,5,1
1406,15362719,Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,Dynamic tracking of acute ischemic tissue fates using improved unsupervised ISODATA analysis of high-resolution quantitative perfusion and diffusion data.,"High-resolution (200 x 200 x 1,500 microm3) imaging was performed to derive quantitative cerebral blood flow (CBF) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in stroke rats (permanent occlusion) every 30 minutes up to 3 hours after occlusion onset, followed by histology at 24 hours. An improved automated iterative-self-organizing-data-analysis-algorithm (ISODATA) was developed to dynamically track ischemic tissue fate on a pixel-by-pixel basis during the acute phase. ISODATA-resolved clusters were overlaid on the CBF-ADC scatterplots and image spaces. Tissue volume ADC, and CBF of each ISODATA cluster were derived. In contrast to the single-cluster normal left hemisphere (ADC = 0.74 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm2/s, CBF = 1.36 +/- 0.22 mL g(-1)min(-1), mean +/- SD, n = 8), the right ischemic hemisphere exhibited three ISODATA clusters, namely: 'normal' (normal ADC and CBF), 'ischemic core' (low CBF and ADC), and at-risk 'perfusion-diffusion mismatch' (low CBF but normal ADC). At 180 minutes, the mismatch disappeared in five rats (Group I, 180-minute 'core' lesion volume = 255 +/- 62 mm3 and 24-hour infarct volume = 253 +/- 55 mm3, P > 0.05), while a substantial mismatch persisted in three rats (Group II, 180-minute CBF-abnormal volume = 198 +/- 7 mm3 and 24-hour infarct volume 148 +/- 18 mm3, P < 0.05). The CBF (0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1)min(-1)) of the 'persistent mismatch' (Group II, 0.3 +/- 0.09 mL g(-1)min(-1)) was above the CBF viability threshold (0.2 to 0.3 mL g(-1)min(-1)) throughout and its ADC (0.70 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm2/s) did not decrease as ischemia progressed. In contrast, the CBF (0.08 +/- 0.03 mL g(-1)min(-1)) of the analogous brain region in Group I was below the CBF viability threshold, and its ADC gradually decreased from 0.63 +/- 0.05 to 0.43 +/- 0.03 x 10(-3) mm2/s (ADC viability threshold = 0.53 +/- 0.02 x 10(-3) mm2/s). The modified ISODATA analysis of the ADC and CBF tissue characteristics during the acute phase could provide a useful and unbiased means to characterize and predict tissue fates in ischemic brain injury and to monitor therapeutic intervention.",,Animal-other,5,1

In the il6(+/+) mice, ethanol ingestion decreased bone mineral density, as determined by dual-energy densitometry; decreased cancellous bone volume and trabecular width and increased trabecular spacing and osteoclast surface, as determined by histomorphometry of the femur; increased urinary deoxypyridinolines, as determined by ELISA; and increased CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis as determined ex vivo in bone marrow cell cultures. In contrast, ethanol ingestion did not alter any of these parameters in the il6(-/-) mice. Ethanol increased receptor activator of NF-kappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA expression in the bone marrow of il6(+/+) but not il6(-/-) mice. Additionally, ethanol decreased several osteoblastic parameters including osteoblast perimeter and osteoblast culture calcium retention in both il6(+/+) and il6(-/-) mice. These findings demonstrate that ethanol induces bone loss through IL-6. Furthermore, they suggest that IL-6 achieves this effect by inducing RANKL and promoting CFU-GM formation and osteoclastogenesis.",,Animal-other,5,1

However, the underlying neurochemical mechanism remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dopamine transporter (DAT) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) on sleep and anxiety recovery after propofol anesthesia in rats with 24 h total sleep deprivation (TSD).	Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were in natural sleep or sleep deprived for 24 h in a sleep deprivation rat system. The rats received propofol anesthesia (75 mg/kg, i.p.) or natural sleep. Dopamine transporter knockdown was performed by microinjection of AAV-DAT-RNAi vector. EEG was measured in each group to evaluate the subsequent sleep. The elevated plus maze test (EPMT) and open field test (OFT) were used to evaluate locomotion and anxiety level in rats. Immunofluorescence was used to verify virus location and transfection efficiency.	Compared with NC group, the anxiety level of Propofol group showed no significant difference, but REM sleep decreased. Compared with the TSD group, the anxiety level of the TSD + Propofol group was reduced and the sleep recovery was closer to baseline. Compared with TSD + AAV-NC group, anxiety level and sleep time increased in TSD + AAVi group, REM increased within 24 h after sleep deprivation. The sleep time of TSD + AAVi + Propofol group was between those of TSD + AAV-NC group and TSD + AAVi group. TSD + AAV-NC + Propofol group had the least sleep time and the lowest anxiety level.	1. Propofol did not change anxiety level in normal rats, but reduced REM sleep, while it could accelerate sleep recovery and reduce anxiety level in sleep-deprived rats. 2. In sleep deprived rats with DAT knockdown, propofol improved sleep and anxiety levels more slowly, especially producing more REM rebound, suggesting that the improvement of sleep and anxiety levels in sleep-deprived rats with propofol may be related to DAT in VTA region.",Anxiety| Dopamine transporter| Electroencephalogram| Propofol| Sleep deprivation| VTA,Animal-other,5,1
1409,15544577,"Genes, brain, and behavior",A phenotypic and molecular characterization of the fmr1-tm1Cgr fragile X mouse.,"Fragile X Syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental retardation. It is also known for having a substantial behavioral morbidity, including autistic features. In humans, Fragile X Syndrome is almost always caused by inactivation of the X-linked FMR1 gene. A single knockout mouse model, fmr1-tm1Cgr, exists. In this report we further characterize the cognitive and behavioral phenotype of the fmr1-tm1Cgr Fragile X mouse through the use of F1 hybrid mice derived from two inbred strains (FVB/NJ and C57BL/6J). Use of F1 hybrids allows focus on the effects of the fmr1-tm1Cgr allele with reduced influence from recessive alleles present in the parental inbred strains. We find that the cognitive phenotype of fmr1-tm1Cgr mice, including measures of working memory and learning set formation that are known to be seriously impacted in humans with Fragile X Syndrome, are essentially normal. Further testing of inbred strains supports this conclusion. Thus, any fmr1-tm1Cgr cognitive deficit is surprisingly mild or absent. There is, however, clear support presented for a robust audiogenic seizure phenotype in all strains tested, as well as increased entries into the center of an open field. Finally, a molecular examination of the fmr1-tm1Cgr mouse shows that, contrary to common belief, it is not a molecular null.

1410,12014493,Veterinary pathology,Experimental rodent models of brainstem tumors,"Despite recent advances in surgical technology, resection is not an option for many brainstem tumors. Experimental models have played essential roles in examining new approaches to therapy. The objective of the present study was to generate models by determining coordinates for safe inoculation into the brainstem of mice and rats, and to establish whether the implantation of heterotopic cells would create reproducible survival curves. Morbidity and survival studies were used to map stereotactic coordinates allowing successful inoculation of tumor cells. Survival studies were used to investigate the time course of tumor growth. Tumor location was examined by light microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. Mice survived injections of 2 microL of saline at interaural, lateral, and depth coordinates of -2.5, 1.0, and 3.5 mm and -1.5, 1.0, and 3.5 mm. Rats survived injections at interaural, lateral, and depth coordinates of -2.0, 2.0, and 7.0 mm and -3.0, 0, and 7.0 mm. Median survival of mice challenged with 5 x 10(5) EMT6 and 10(4) B16 tumor cells was 11 and 10 days, respectively.

1411,34134000,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Super-enhancer-driven Sorting Nexin 5 expression promotes dopaminergic neuronal ferroptosis in Parkinson's disease models.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. Recent studies revealed that the ferroptosis pathway is involved in the death process of dopaminergic neurons in PD. The aberrant endosomal sorting pathway, which results in aberrant iron level in eukaryotic cells, may serve a role in the ferroptosis pathway in PD condition. However, its specific molecular mechanisms remained unclear. In the present study, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay, the rank ordering of super-enhancers (ROSE) algorithm, and RNA interference (RNAi) to explore the regulatory mechanism of PD-specific super-enhancer (SE) in the endosomal sorting pathway and ferroptosis pathway of 6-OHDA-lesioned rats and cells. The ChIP assay and ROSE algorithm results showed that there are specific SEs expression in 6-OHDA-lesioned SNc of PD rats, and the most significant expression gene is Sorting Nexin 5 (SNX5). SNX5 silencing by RNAi experiments significantly decreased the level of ferroptosis in 6-OHDA-lesioned PC12 cells, suggesting the correlation between the SNX5, ferroptosis, and PD. In conclusion, this study investigated the mechanism by which PD-specific SE driven SNX5 promoted the ferroptosis level in PD models. This study further improved the understanding of the mechanism of ferroptosis during PD injury and provided potential therapeutic targets and clinical diagnostic markers in PD condition.",Endosomal sorting pathway| Ferroptosis| Parkinson's disease| SNX5| Super-enhancer,Animal-other,5,1
1412,20394775,Journal of neuroscience methods,Development of a simplified spinal cord ischemia model in mice,"Use of genetically manipulated mice facilitates understanding pathological mechanisms in many diseases and contributes to therapy development. However, there is no practical and clinically relevant mouse model available for spinal cord ischemia. This report introduces a simplified long-term outcome mouse model of spinal cord ischemia. Male C57Bl/6J mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and endotracheally intubated. The middle segment of the thoracic aorta was clamped for 0, 8, 10 or 12 min via left lateral thoracotomy. Rectal temperature was maintained at 37.0+/-0.5 degrees C. A laser Doppler probe was used to measure lumbar spinal cord blood flow during thoracic aorta cross-clamping. Open field locomotor function and rotarod performance were evaluated at 1h and 1, 3, 5, and 7 days post-injury. Surviving neurons in the lumbar ventral horn were counted at 7 days post-injury. Cross-clamping the middle segment of the thoracic aorta resulted in approximately 90% blood flow reduction in the lumbar spinal cord. Neurological deficit and neuronal cell death were associated with ischemia duration. Another set of mice were subjected to 10 min aortic clamping or sham surgery and neurological function was examined at 1h and 1, 3, 5, 7, 14, and 28 days. Four of 5 mice (80%) in the injured group survived 28 days and had significant neurological deficit. This study indicates that cross-clamping of the aorta via left thoracotomy is a simple and reliable method to induce spinal cord ischemia in mice allowing definition of long-term outcome.",,Animal-other,5,1

Human patients with AD typically develop motor deficits, which worsen as the disease progresses, but 3xTg-AD mice have been reported to show enhanced motor abilities. We investigated the motor behaviour phenotype of male and female 3xTg-AD and B6129SF2 wildtype mice on a battery of motor behaviours at 6 months of age. Compared to wildtype mice, the 3xTg-AD mice had enhanced motor performance on the Rotarod, but worse performance on the grid suspension task. In gait analysis 3xTg-AD mice had a longer stride length and made more foot slips on the balance beam than wildtype mice. There was no overall difference in voluntary wheel-running activity between genotypes, but there was a disruption in circadian activity rhythm in 3xTg-AD mice. In some motor tasks, such as the Rotarod and balance beam, females appeared to perform better than males, but this sex differences was accounted for by differences in body weight. Our results indicate that while the 3xTg-AD mice show enhanced performance on the Rotarod, they have poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks, indicating that their motor behaviour phenotype is more complex than previously reported. The presence of the P301L transgene may explain the enhancement of Rotarod performance but the poorer performance on other motor behaviour tasks may be due to other transgenes.",3xTg-AD| Alzheimer's disease| Motor Behaviour| Mouse Model,Animal-other,5,1

Comparison of single bilateral and double bilateral lesions.,"For future investigation of possible perturbation of circadian rhythm in animal models of Parkinson's disease we needed an animal model providing lasting 80-100% striatal dopaminergic depletion in rats, but without induced mortality. We have thus compared the effects of a single hydroxydopamine bilateral striatal lesion (SB-hydroxydopamine) with those of a double hydroxydopamine bilateral lesion (DB-hydroxydopamine) at the same dose (16 microg/striatum) by HPLC determination of dopamine and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (dopac) levels in the striatum. Two weeks after neurosurgery, SB-hydroxydopamine and DB-hydroxydopamine induced dopaminergic depletion of at least 81% compared with control groups. After eight weeks striatal dopaminergic depletion was only 60.97% in SB-hydroxydopamine rats, suggesting a compensatory phenomenon, whereas in DB-hydroxydopamine rats dopaminergic loss was stable at 88%. For the DB-hydroxydopamine group the dopac/dopamine ratio was significantly increased at week 2 only, whereas no significant change was observed for other groups. This increase might be explained by increased dopamine turnover. We have demonstrated that striatal DB-hydroxydopamine injection induces lasting 80-100% neuronal loss, close to that observed in the disease in man, without induced mortality, and provides a tool which meets our experimental requirements.",,Animal-other,5,1

Therefore, the development and application of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging radiotracers that selectively bind to aggregated tau in fibril form is of importance in furthering the understanding of these disorders. While radiotracers used in human PET studies offer invaluable insight, radiotracers that are also capable of visualizing tau fibrils in animal models are important tools for translational research into these diseases. Herein, we report the synthesis and characterization of a novel library of compounds based on the phenyl/pyridinylbutadienylbenzothiazoles/benzothiazolium (PBB3) backbone developed for this application. From this library, we selected the compound LM229, which binds to recombinant tau fibrils with high affinity (K(d) = 3.6 nM) and detects with high specificity (a) pathological 4R tau aggregates in living cultured neurons and mouse brain sections from transgenic human P301S tau mice, (b) truncated human 151-351 3R (SHR24) and 4R (SHR72) tau aggregates in transgenic rat brain sections, and (c) tau neurofibrillary tangles in brain sections from Alzheimer's disease (3R/4R tau) and progressive supranuclear palsy (4R tau). With LM229 also shown to cross the blood-brain barrier in vivo and its effective radiolabeling with the radioisotope carbon-11, we have established a novel platform for PET translational studies using rodent transgenic tau models.",PET| imaging| mouse| neurodegeneration| rat| tau,Animal-other,5,1

How olfactory deficits are linked with AD-like neuropathological changes is still unknown. Here, by using two anosmia animal models, bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (OBX) rats and Cnga2(-/Y) mice, which lack intact olfactory CNG channels, we found the immunoreactivity of phosphorylated neurofilament (NF) are highly increased in the neurites at both the hippocampus and the cortex.

Here we use such a model, termed APPsi:tTA, to determine what phenotypes persist in mice with high amyloid burden after new production of APP/Aβ has been suppressed. We find that 12- to 13-month-old APPsi:tTA mice are impaired in cognitive tasks that assess short- and long-term memories. Acutely suppressing new APPsi/Aβ production produced highly significant improvements in performing short-term spatial memory tasks, which upon continued suppression translated to superior performance in more demanding tasks that assess long-term spatial memory and working memory. Deficits in episodic-like memory and cognitive flexibility, however, were more persistent. Arresting mutant APPsi production caused a rapid decline in the brain levels of soluble APP ectodomains, full-length APP, and APP C-terminal fragments. As expected, amyloid deposits persisted after new APP/Aβ production was inhibited, whereas, unexpectedly, we detected persistent pools of solubilizable, relatively mobile, Aβ42. Additionally, we observed persistent levels of Aβ-immunoreactive entities that were of a size consistent with SDS-resistant oligomeric assemblies. Thus, in this model with significant amyloid pathology, a rapid amelioration of cognitive deficits was observed despite persistent levels of oligomeric Aβ assemblies and low, but detectable solubilizable Aβ42 peptides. These findings implicate complex relationships between accumulating Aβ and activities of APP, soluble APP ectodomains, and/or APP C-terminal fragments in mediating cognitive deficits in this model of amyloidosis.",,Animal-other,5,1

Besides motor impairment, PD patients exhibit non-motor symptoms that negatively impact their quality of life and often manifest prior to motor deficits. One such symptom is mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI), which is comprised of deficits in executive function such as working memory, attention, cognitive flexibility, and spatial memory. The 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral medial forebrain bundle (MFB) lesion animal model successfully recapitulates PD motor impairment but is also used to assess non-motor deficits. The present study utilizes a unilateral 6-OHDA induced MFB lesion rodent model to investigate prefrontal cortex (PFC)-mediated cognitive processes that are impaired in PD patients. In a test of attentional set shifting, PD rodents demonstrated deficits in simple discrimination, but not in rule reversal or extradimensional shifts. PD rodents also exhibited deficits in a temporal order memory task but had no deficits in novel/spatial object recognition or object-in-place tasks. These results reveal limitations of the 6-OHDA induced unilateral MFB lesion model to completely recapitulate PD-MCI symptoms suggesting a need for better lesion models to study PD-MCI.",Medial forebrain bundle lesion| Mild cognitive impairment| Novel object recognition task| Parkinson’s disease| Prefrontal cortex| Set shifting task,Animal-other,5,1
1419,31758600,Journal of neuroscience research,Parenchymal pericytes are not the major contributor of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic scar after stroke in male mice.,"Scar formation after injury of the brain or spinal cord is a common event. While glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied, much less is known about the fibrotic scar, in particular after stroke. Platelet-derived growth factor receptor ß-expressing (PDGFRß[+]) pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins after detaching from the vessel wall. However, to what extent these parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear. Here, we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of PDGFRß[+] cells due to the loss of regulator of G-protein signaling 5 in pericytes. We find that only a small fraction of parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells co-label with type I collagen and fibronectin. Consequently, a reduction in parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells by ca. 50% did not affect the overall type I collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke. The redistribution of PDGFRß[+] cells to a perivascular location, however, resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke. We demonstrate that parenchymal PDGFRß[+] cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ECM, and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke.",RRID:AB_2082660| RRID:AB_2105706| RRID:AB_2162497| RRID:AB_217595| RRID:AB_2298772| RRID:AB_298179| RRID:AB_305808| RRID:AB_354858| RRID:AB_393571| RRID:AB_467492| RRID:SCR_002798| RRID:SCR_003070| RRID:SCR_010279| collagen| extracellular matrix| fibronectin| fibrotic scar| glial scar| pericytes| stroke,Animal-other,5,1

Some transgenic mouse models of AD also exhibit social withdrawal and aggression, but many of these models only recapitulate the early stages of the disease. By comparison, the 5xFAD mouse model of AD exhibits rapid, progressive neurodegeneration, and is suitable for modeling cognitive and behavioral deficits at early, mid-, and late-stage disease progression. Anecdotal reports suggest that transgenic 5xFAD males exhibit high levels of aggression compared to wild-type controls, but to date, indirect genetic effects in this strain have not been studied. We measured home-cage behaviors in 5xFAD males housed in three different group-housing conditions (transgenic-only, wild-type only, and mixed-genotype) and social approach behaviors when exposed to a novel free-roaming or restrained, wild-type or transgenic conspecific. Transgenic-only home cages required earlier separation due to injuries arising from aggression compared to wild-type-only or mixed-genotype cages, despite no obvious increase in the frequency of aggressive behaviors. Transgenic 5xFAD males and females also spent less time investigating free-roaming conspecifics compared to wild-type controls, but they showed normal investigation of restrained conspecifics; the genotype of the conspecific did not affect approach behavior, and there was no aggression observed in transgenic males. These findings provide evidence in an animal model that amyloid pathology ultimately leads to avoidance of novel social stimuli, and that frequent interactions between individuals exhibiting an AD phenotype further exacerbates aggressive behaviors.",5xFAD| Alzheimer's disease| aggression| social approach| transgenic mice,Animal-other,5,1
1421,20513660,Brain : a journal of neurology,Bone morphogenetic protein-7 release from endogenous neural precursor cells suppresses the tumourigenicity of stem-like glioblastoma cells.,"Glioblastoma cells with stem-like properties control brain tumour growth and recurrence. Here, we show that endogenous neural precursor cells perform an anti-tumour response by specifically targeting stem-like brain tumour cells. In vitro, neural precursor cells predominantly express bone morphogenetic protein-7; bone morphogenetic protein-7 is constitutively released from neurospheres and induces canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells. Exposure of human and murine stem-like brain tumour cells to neurosphere-derived bone morphogenetic protein-7 induces tumour stem cell differentiation, attenuates stem-like marker expression and reduces self-renewal and the ability for tumour initiation. Neurosphere-derived or recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-7 reduces glioblastoma expansion from stem-like cells by down-regulating the transcription factor Olig2. In vivo, large numbers of bone morphogenetic protein-7-expressing neural precursors encircle brain tumours in young mice, induce canonical bone morphogenetic protein signalling in stem-like glioblastoma cells and can thereby attenuate tumour formation. This anti-tumour response is strongly reduced in older mice. Our results indicate that endogenous neural precursor cells protect the young brain from glioblastoma by releasing bone morphogenetic protein-7, which acts as a paracrine tumour suppressor that represses proliferation, self-renewal and tumour-initiation of stem-like glioblastoma cells.",,Animal-other,5,1

To address this issue, we studied the responses of D1CT-7 mice to two critical components of TS pathophysiology: the exacerbation of tic-like behaviours in response to stress and the presence of sensorimotor gating deficits, which are thought to reflect the perceptual alterations causing the tics. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: D1CT-7 and wild-type (WT) littermates were subjected to a 20 min session of spatial confinement (SC) within an inescapable, 10 cm wide cylindrical enclosure. Changes in plasma corticosterone levels, tic-like behaviours and other spontaneous responses were measured. SC-exposed mice were also tested for the prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response (a sensorimotor gating index) and other TS-related behaviours, including open-field locomotion, novel object exploration and social interaction and compared with non-confined counterparts. KEY RESULTS: SC produced a marked increase in corticosterone concentrations in both D1CT-7 and WT mice. In D1CT-7, but not WT mice, SC exacerbated tic-like and digging behaviours, and triggered PPI deficits and aggressive responses. Conversely, SC did not modify locomotor activity or novel object exploration in D1CT-7 mice. Both tic-like behaviours and PPI impairments in SC-exposed D1CT-7 mice were inhibited by standard TS therapies and D1 dopamine receptor antagonism. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: These findings collectively support the translational and construct validity of D1CT-7 mice with respect to TS.

In this study the changes in rat PRL cells by estrogen treatment were studied histologically and immunocytochemically. Furthermore, intracellular structures in PRL cells were observed by high resolution scanning electron microscopy using the aldehyde prefix osmium-DMSO-osmium method. These rat pituitary tumors were established in Fischer-344 female rats by weekly injections of 2.5 mg estradiol valerate. The estrogen-induced, autonomous and transplantable rat pituitary tumors (MtT/F84) were also studied in the same manner and the findings were compared with estrogen-induced tumors. The increase of weight of pituitary gland and of serum PRL level correlated significantly with the number of estrogen administration. On the basis of histological findings, estrogen-induced pituitary tumors can be classified into two different stages, that is, hypertrophic hyperplasia and adenomatous hyperplasia. The former corresponds to the period until 6 weeks after the beginning of estrogen treatment and the latter to the period thereafter. In the former, PRL cells were significantly increased in number and volume, and were diffusely immunoreactive for PRL in the cytoplasm. Cell atypism was rarely found. The extent of acidophil staining was well preserved in hematoxylin-eosin staining. Ultrastructurally, organelles were well developed, especially rough endoplasmic reticulum showed whorl formation. Immature, irregularly shaped secretory granules were frequently observed within the Golgi area.

Statistically significant alterations in the concentrations of both enzymes occurred in the olfactory, caudate, and neocortical regions at 5 days postinfection. No such alterations occurred in mice given cytoxan (150 mg/kg) 3 days postinfection and examined 5 days postinfection. At 10 days postinfection, however, the cytoxan-treated animals had significantly altered enzyme concentrations in the olfactory region, though not in the caudate or neocortex. This alteration appeared to be transitory, since it was not found in cytoxan-treated animals 60 days postinfection. A possible explanation is that virus production or interference in a brain region cycles over a period of hours or days. Still undetermined is whether these neurochemical changes are a primary effect of the virus or a secondary effect due to the immune response. It is noteworthy that cytoxan caused a marked increase in the enzyme activities studied in most of the brain areas.",,Animal-other,5,1

Here, we present results from a longitudinal analysis of annual counts of six bird species, using North American Breeding Bird Survey data from ten states (1994 to 2010). We fit overdispersed Poisson models to annual counts. Counts from successive years were linked by an autoregressive process that depended on WNV transmission intensity (annual West Nile neuroinvasive disease reports) and was adjusted by El Niño Southern Oscillation events. These models were fit using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm.	Model fit was mostly excellent, especially for American Crows, for which our models explained between 26% and 81% of the observed variance. The impact of WNV on bird populations was quantitatively evaluated by contrasting hypothetical count trajectories (omission of WNV) with observed counts. Populations of American crows were most consistently affected with a substantial cumulative impact in six of ten states. The largest negative impact, almost 60%, was found in Illinois. A regionally substantial decline was also seen for American Robins and House Sparrows, while the other species appeared unaffected.	Our results confirm findings from previous studies that single out American Crows as the species most vulnerable to WNV infection. We discuss strengths and limitations of this and other methods for quantifying the impact of WNV on bird populations.",,Animal-other,5,1

The essential pathological feature of CSVD is the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Dysfunction of BBB due to degeneration of both endothelial cells and pericytes in capillaries leads to neuronal damage and progressive brain atrophy. Moreover, deterioration of amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance due to the failure of the transvascular BBB transport system results in accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) elicits functional recovery in experimental models including stroke and spinal cord injury. One effect of MSCs is to restore disrupted BBB through remodeling of microvasculature. Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (stroke-prone) with impaired cognitive function as a CSVD model, we have shown that infused MSCs has a therapeutic effect for cognitive function. Restoration of BBB function via remodeling of microvasculature and inhibition of Aβ accumulation could inhibit progressive brain atrophy and lead to restore cognitive dysfunction. Gene expression analysis indicated that infused MSCs activates both transforming growth factor-β and angiopoietin 1 signaling pathways and promotes the remodeling of microvasculature. Thus, infused MSCs may represent a novel therapy for both VD and AD.",blood–brain barrier| cellular therapy| cerebral small vessel disease| dementia| mesenchymal stem cell,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Stem cell therapies propose a hope for treating spinal cord injuries via differentiation into neurons and associated glial cells, halting the immune attacks, inhibiting apoptosis and necrosis, and secretion of neurotrophic factors that stimulate the regeneration process. AIM: The study aims to evaluate the use of autologous bone marrow derived stromal cells in platelet-rich plasma carrier for selected clinical cases having chronic spinal cord injuries in dogs and cats via a one-time combined intrathecal/intravenous injection. METHODS: Cells were injected in five dogs and three cats suffering from disc protrusion leading to spinal cord injury and in thosewho did not respond to conventional treatment during a clinical trial. RESULTS: Results indicated that the transplanted cells led to the restoration of the weight bearing locomotor function and spinal reflexes in a period less than 90 days with physical rehabilitation. The treatment showed minor changes in the magnetic resonance images of extruded discs.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) is the key factor that triggers the course of AD, and reducing the deposition of Aβ in the brain has been considered as a potential target for the treatment of AD. In clinical and animal studies, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for AD. In recent years, substantial evidence has accumulated suggesting the important role of the glymphatic system in Aβ clearance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore whether EA modifies the accumulation of Aβ through the glymphatic system and may thus be applied to alleviate cognitive impairments. METHODS: Seven-month-old SAMP8 mice were randomized into a control group (Pc) and an electroacupuncture group (Pe). Age-matched SAMR1 mice were used as normal controls (Rc). Mice in the Pe group were stimulated on Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 10 min and then pricked at Shuigou (GV26) for ten times. EA treatment lasted for 8 weeks. In each week, EA would be applied once a day for the first five consecutive days and ceased at the remaining two days. After EA treatment, Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the cognitive function; HE and Nissl staining was performed to observe the brain histomorphology; ELISA, contrast-enhanced MRI, and immunofluorescence were applied to explore the mechanisms underlying EA effects from Aβ accumulation, glymphatic system function, reactivity of astrocytes, and AQP4 polarization, respectively. RESULTS: This EA regime could improve cognition and alleviate neuropathological damage to brain tissue. And EA treatment might reduce Aβ accumulation, enhance paravascular influx in the glymphatic system, inhibit the reactivity of astrocytes, and improve AQP4 polarity. CONCLUSION: EA treatment might reduce Aβ accumulation from the brain via improving clearance performance of the glymphatic system and thereby alleviating cognitive impairment.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

METHODS AND MATERIALS: B6.Cg-Tg (APPswePSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J AD-prone mice were given cranial X-irradiation. The number of Aβ plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1β, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Aβ burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task. RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Aβ plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy × 10), 72% (2 Gy × 5) and 78% (2 Gy × 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Aβ burden (2 Gy × 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy × 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-β plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function.

Animals were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments (n = 8 per group) 7 days after tumor implantation: 1) control: no treatment; 2) external beam radiation therapy (XRT) (total 20 Gy in 400-cGy daily fractions); 3) surgery: L6 vertebral corpectomy, tumor resection, and polymethyl methacrylate reconstruction; and 4) surgery + XRT: corpectomy and tumor resection followed by XRT (total 20 Gy in 400-cGy daily fractions) 72 hours after surgery. Hind-limb function was tested daily after treatment using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale (range, 1-21). RESULTS: All animals (n = 32) demonstrated normal hind-limb function (BBB score, 21) on posttreatment Day 1. The XRT, surgery, and surgery + XRT groups all experienced a delay in onset of paresis versus the control group. Compared to the XRT group, the surgery group demonstrated greater median BBB scores on Days 3 (21 versus 20, P = 0.02) through 9 (12 versus 8, P = 0.002) after treatment. Compared with the surgery group, the surgery + XRT group demonstrated even greater median BBB scores on Days 6 (21 versus 19, P = 0.0008) through 11 (16 versus 8, P = 0.0001) after treatment. Median time to loss of ambulation (BBB <or= 7) was greatest in the surgery + XRT group (15 d) when compared with the surgery (12 d, P = 0.001), XRT (9 d, P = 0.001), or control groups (7 d, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: In a rat model of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, decompressive surgery followed by radiotherapy yielded the greatest efficacy in the prevention of neurological decline when compared with surgery or radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy alone attenuated neurological decline but was the least efficacious treatment in this model. These results support this animal model as an effective platform to investigate novel interventions for metastatic spine tumors.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

However, it still lacks effective intervention in clinical practice. Here, we investigated the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in cerebrovascular repair in 3xTg-AD mice and its mechanism. METHODS: 3xTg-AD mice were employed to evaluate the protective effect of EA at ST36 acupoint (EAST36). Behavioral tests were performed to assess neurological disorders. Laser speckle contrast imaging, immunostaining, and Western blot were applied to determine EAST36-boosted cerebrovascular repair. The mechanism was explored in 3xTg mice and endothelial cell cultures by melatonin signaling modulation. RESULTS: EAST36 at 20/100 Hz effectively alleviated the olfactory impairment and anxiety behavior and boosted cerebrovascular repair in AD mice. EAST36 attenuated cerebral microvascular degeneration in AD mice by modulating endothelial cell viability and injury. Consequently, the Aβ deposits and neural damage in AD mice were reversed after EAST36. Mechanistically, we revealed that EAST36 restored melatonin levels in AD mice. Melatonin supplement mimicked the EAST36 effect on cerebrovascular protection in AD mice and endothelial cell cultures. Importantly, blockage of melatonin signaling by antagonist blunted EAST36-induced cerebrovascular recovery and subsequent neurological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided strong evidence to support EAST36 as a potential nonpharmacological therapy against cerebrovascular impairment in AD. Further study is necessary to better understand how EAST36 treatment drives melatonin signaling.",Alzheimer's disease| cerebrovascular impairment| electroacupuncture at ST36 acupoint| endothelial cell| melatonin signaling,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

METHODS: We divided all rats into three groups: N (adult rats after neonatal hyperthermic HIE without subsequent 3-h hypothermia), H (adult rats after neonatal hyperthermic HIE with subsequent 3-h hypothermia) and Sham (S) groups. We evaluated their malfunctions with the rota-rod test and the step-down passive avoidance test. We also analyzed the cerebrum width and the hippocampal CA1 area of the insulted hemisphere. RESULTS: In the rota-rod test, the result of the N group was significantly worse than that of the S group. In the step-down passive avoidance test, the result of the N group was significantly worse than those of the S and H groups. The longest cerebrum width and the hippocampal CA1 area of the insulted hemisphere of the N group were significantly smaller than those of the S and H groups. CONCLUSION: Neonatal hyperthermic hypoxic-ischemic insult restricts motor function and learning ability after growth, and such neuronal malfunctions can be relieved by hypothermia for 3 h soon after neonatal HIE.",Hyperthermia| hypothermia| neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy| rota-rod test| step-down passive avoidance test,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of CS/RT versus RT in a nonhuman primate model of cortical ischemic stroke. METHODS: Squirrel monkeys learned a pellet retrieval task, then received an infarct to the distal forelimb (DFL) representation of primary motor cortex. A subdural monopolar electrode was implanted over the spared DFL representation in dorsal premotor cortex (PMD). Seven weeks postinfarct, monkeys underwent 4 to 6 weeks of RT (n = 8) or CS/RT (n = 7; 100 Hz, cathodal current) therapy. Behavioral performance was assessed before and after infarct, prior to therapy, and 1 and 12 weeks posttherapy (follow-up). The primary outcome measure was motor performance at 1 week posttherapy. Secondary outcomes included follow-up performance at 12 weeks and treatment-related changes in neurophysiological maps of spared DFL representations. RESULTS: While postinfarct performance deficits were found in all monkeys, both groups demonstrated similar recovery profiles, with no difference in motor recovery between the RT and CS/RT groups. Posttherapy, PMD DFL area was significantly expanded in the RT group but not the CS/RT group. A significant relationship was found between motor recovery and DFL expansion in premotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the specific parameters utilized here were not optimal for promoting behavioral recovery in nonhuman primates. Though CS/RT has consistently shown efficacy in rat stroke models, the present finding has cautionary implications for translation of CS/RT therapy to clinical populations.",implanted stimulation electrodes| neuronal plasticity| premotor cortex| primary motor cortex| primate,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1436,32100127,Microbial ecology,Therapeutic Effects of the In Vitro Cultured Human Gut Microbiota as Transplants on Altering Gut Microbiota and Improving Symptoms Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain-based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities. Accumulating studies show that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of ASD, and gut microbiota transplantation (GMT) is a promising technique for the treatment of ASD. In clinical applications of GMT, it is challenging to obtain effective transplants because of the high costs of donor selection and heterogeneity of donors' gut microbiota, which can cause different clinical responses. In vitro batch culture is a fast, easy-to-operate, and repeatable method to culture gut microbiota. Thus, the present study investigates the feasibility of treating ASD with in vitro cultured gut microbiota as transplants. We cultured gut microbiota via the in vitro batch culture method and performed GMT in the maternal immune activation (MIA)-induced ASD mouse model with original donor microbiota and in vitro cultured microbiota. Open field, three-chamber social, marble burying, and self-grooming tests were used for behavioral improvement assessment. Serum levels of chemokines were detected. Microbial total DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples, and 16S rDNA was sequenced using Illumina. Our results showed that GMT treatment with original and cultured donor gut microbiota significantly ameliorated anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors and improved serum levels of chemokines including GRO-α (CXCL1), MIP-1α (CCL3), MCP-3 (CCL7), RANTES (CCL5), and Eotaxin (CCL11) in ASD mice. Meanwhile, the gut microbial communities of the two groups that received GMT treatment were changed compared with the ASD mice groups. In the group treated with in vitro cultured donor gut microbiota, there was a significant decrease in the relative abundance of key differential taxa, including S24-7, Clostridiaceae, Prevotella_other, and Candidatus Arthromitus. The relative abundance of these taxa reached close to the level of healthy mice. Prevotella_other also decreased in the group treated with original donor gut microbiota, with a significant increase in Ruminococcaceae and Oscillospira. The present study demonstrated that GMT with in vitro cultured microbiota also improved behavioral abnormalities and chemokine disorders in an ASD mouse model compared with GMT with original donor gut microbiota. In addition, it significantly modified several key differential taxa in gut microbial composition.",Autism spectrum disorder| Gut microbiota transplantation| In vitro batch culture| Mouse model,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Using our previously described rat model of IMSCT, we describe a technique for microsurgical tumor resection and present the functional and histopathological analysis of tumor progression.	Twenty-four Fischer 344 rats were randomized into two groups. All animals received a 5-microl intramedullary injection of 9L gliosarcoma cells. Animals were evaluated daily for signs of paralysis using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale. Group 1 continued with daily assessments using the BBB scale following tumor implantation, but received no further treatment. Group 2 underwent surgical removal of intramedullary tumor on postoperative day five. At a BBB score less than 5 (e.g., functional paraplegia), all animals of both groups were killed and sent for histopathological analysis.	Group 1 had a median onset of functional hind limb paraplegia at 15 +/- 1.0 days. Group 2 had a median onset of hind limb paresis at 53 +/- 0.46 days. Hematoxylin-eosin cross-sections confirmed the presence of intramedullary 9L tumor invading the spinal cord in both groups.	Animals with 9L IMSCTs consistently developed hind limb paraplegia in a reliable and reproducible manner. Animals undergoing microsurgical resection of IMSCT had a significant delay in the onset of functional paraplegia compared to the untreated controls. These findings suggest that this model may mimic the behavior of IMSCTs following operative resection in humans and thus may be used to examine efficacy of new treatment options for high-grade intramedullary tumors.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1438,27485458,Scientific reports,Functional Recovery from Neural Stem/Progenitor Cell Transplantation Combined with Treadmill Training in Mice with Chronic Spinal Cord Injury,"Most studies targeting chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) have concluded that neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) transplantation exerts only a subclinical recovery; this in contrast to its remarkable effect on acute and subacute SCI. To determine whether the addition of rehabilitative intervention enhances the effect of NS/PC transplantation for chronic SCI, we used thoracic SCI mouse models to compare manifestations secondary to both transplantation and treadmill training, and the two therapies combined, with a control group. Significant locomotor recovery in comparison with the control group was only achieved in the combined therapy group. Further investigation revealed that NS/PC transplantation improved spinal conductivity and central pattern generator activity, and that treadmill training promoted the appropriate inhibitory motor control. The combined therapy enhanced these independent effects of each single therapy, and facilitated neuronal differentiation of transplanted cells and maturation of central pattern generator activity synergistically. Our data suggest that rehabilitative treatment represents a therapeutic option for locomotor recovery after NS/PC transplantation, even in chronic SCI.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1439,28632582,The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,"The effect of resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta, partial aortic occlusion and aggressive blood transfusion on traumatic brain injury in a swine multiple injuries model","BACKGROUND: Despite clinical reports of poor outcomes, the degree to which resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) exacerbates traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not known. We hypothesized that combined effects of increased proximal mean arterial pressure (pMAP), carotid blood flow (Qcarotid), and intracranial pressure (ICP) from REBOA would lead to TBI progression compared with partial aortic occlusion (PAO) or no intervention. METHODS: Twenty-one swine underwent a standardized TBI via computer Controlled cortical impact followed by 25% total blood volume rapid hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of hypotension, animals were randomized to 60 minutes of continued hypotension (Control), REBOA, or PAO. REBOA and PAO animals were then weaned from occlusion. All animals were resuscitated with shed blood via a rapid blood infuser. Physiologic parameters were recorded continuously and brain computed tomography obtained at specified intervals. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline physiology or during the initial 30 minutes of hypotension. During the 60-minute intervention period, REBOA resulted in higher maximal pMAP (REBOA, 105.3 ± 8.8; PAO, 92.7 ± 9.2; Control, 48.9 ± 7.7; p = 0.02) and higher Qcarotid (REBOA, 673.1 ± 57.9; PAO, 464.2 ± 53.0; Control, 170.3 ± 29.4; p < 0.01). Increases in ICP were greatest during blood resuscitation, with Control animals demonstrating the largest peak ICP (Control, 12.8 ± 1.2; REBOA, 5.1 ± 0.6; PAO, 9.4 ± 1.1; p < 0.01). There were no differences in the percentage of animals with hemorrhage progression on CT (Control, 14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-57.9; REBOA, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0; and PAO, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0). CONCLUSION: In an animal model of TBI and shock, REBOA increased Qcarotid and pMAP, but did not exacerbate TBI progression. PAO resulted in physiology closer to baseline with smaller increases in ICP and pMAP. Rapid blood resuscitation, not REBOA, resulted in the largest increase in ICP after intervention, which occurred in Control animals. Continued studies of the cerebral hemodynamics of aortic occlusion and blood transfusion are required to determine optimal resuscitation strategies for multi-injured patients.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Currently, there is no evidence-based specific treatment for neonates with stroke. Several studies have reported the benefits of umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell treatment in rodent models of neonatal brain injury. However, all of the studies examined the effects of administering either the UCB mononuclear cell fraction or UCB-derived mesenchymal stem cells in neonatal rat models. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of human UCB CD34(+) cells (hematopoietic stem cell/endothelial progenitor cells) in a mouse model of neonatal stroke, which we recently developed. On postnatal day 12, immunocompromized (SCID) mice underwent permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Forty-eight hours after MCAO, human UCB CD34(+) cells (1×10(5)cells) were injected intravenously into the mice. The area in which cerebral blood flow (CBF) was maintained was temporarily larger in the cell-treated group than in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group at 24h after treatment. With cell treatment, the percent loss of ipsilateral hemispheric volume was significantly ameliorated (21.5±1.9%) compared with the PBS group (25.6±5.1%) when assessed at 7weeks after MCAO. The cell-treated group did not exhibit significant differences from the PBS group in either rotarod (238±46s in the sham-surgery group, 175±49s in the PBS group, 203±54s in the cell-treated group) or open-field tests. The intravenous administration of human UCB CD34(+) cells modestly reduced histological ischemic brain damage after neonatal stroke in mice, with a transient augmentation of CBF in the peri-infarct area.",CD34(+) cell| brain injury| cell-based therapy| neonatal encephalopathy| neonatal stroke| umbilical cord blood,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1441,38092268,Neurobiology of disease,Reducing huntingtin by immunotherapy delays disease progression in a mouse model of Huntington disease,"In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly, growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published, mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice. In a series of proof of concept experiments, we found that systemic mAB C6-17 treatment resulted in the distribution of the mAB C6-17 to peripheral and CNS tissues and led to the reduction of HTT protein levels. Compared to CTRL mAB or vehicle treated mice, the mAB C6-17 treated YAC128 animals showed improved body weight and motor behaviors, a delayed progression in motor deficits and reduced striatal EM48 immunoreactivity. These results provide the first proof of concept for the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of an antibody-based anti-HTT passive immunization approach and suggest this modality as a potential new HD treatment strategy.",Extracellular huntingtin| Huntingtin lowering therapy| Huntington disease| Immunotherapy| Passive immunization| Preclinical trial| Transgenic mice,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1442,21951913,Molecular brain,Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells overexpressing galectin-1 improves functional recovery from focal brain ischemia in the Mongolian gerbil.,"Transplantation of human neural stem/progenitor cells (hNSPCs) is a promising method to regenerate tissue from damage and recover function in various neurological diseases including brain ischemia. Galectin-1(Gal1) is a lectin that is expressed in damaged brain areas after ischemia. Here, we characterized the detailed Gal1 expression pattern in an animal model of brain ischemia. After brain ischemia, Gal1 was expressed in reactive astrocytes within and around the infarcted region, and its expression diminished over time. Previously, we showed that infusion of human Gal1 protein (hGal1) resulted in functional recovery after brain ischemia but failed to reduce the volume of the ischemic region. This prompted us to examine whether the combination of hNSPCs-transplantation and stable delivery of hGal1 around the ischemic region could reduce the ischemic volume and promote better functional recovery after brain ischemia. In this study, we transplanted hNSPCs that stably overexpressed hGal1 (hGal1-hNSPCs) in a model of unilateral focal brain ischemia using Mongolian gerbils. Indeed, we found that transplantation of hGal1-hNSPCs both reduced the ischemic volume and improved deficits in motor function after brain ischemia to a greater extent than the transplantation of hNSPCs alone. This study provides evidence for a potential application of hGal1 with hNSPCs-transplantation in the treatment of brain ischemia.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Briefly, the main goal of the present study was to investigate HD's motor deficits through the olfactory ecto-mesenchymals stem cells (OE-MSC) secretome. OE-MSCs were characterized immunophenotypically by the positive expression of CD73, CD90 and CD105. Also, three specific markers of OE-MSCs were obtained from the nasal cavity of human volunteers. The main features of OE-MSCs are their high proliferation, ease of harvesting and growth factor secretion. All animals were randomly assigned to three groups: control, 3-NP + vehicle treated and 3-NP + Cell groups. In both experimental groups, the subjects received intraperitoneal 3-NP (30 mg/kg) injections once a day for five consecutive days, followed by the bilateral intra-striatal implantation of OE-MSCs in the 3-NP + Cell group. Muscular function was assessed by electromyography and rotarod test, and the locomotor function was evaluated using the open field test. According to our findings, striatal transplants of OE-MSCs reduced microglial inflammatory factor, the tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) in the 3-NP + Cell group, with a significant reduction in RIP3, the markers of necroptosis in striatum. In addition to the remarkable recovery of the striatal volume after engraftment, the motor activities were enhanced in the 3-NP + cell group compared to the 3-NP + vehicle group. Taken together, our results demonstrated the in vivo advantages of OE-MSCs treatment in an HD rat model with numerous positive paracrine effects including behavioral and anatomical recovery.",3-Nitropropionic acid| Huntington's disease| Mesenchymal stem cells| Neuroprotection| Stem cell transplantation,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

We showed that after 8 weeks of cell transplantation, the behavior score was significantly ameliorated and fully recovered at the 14th week of cell transplantation. The number of dopaminergic neurons was also significantly improved at the end of the experiment although the number was still about 50% lower than that in the control group.

1445,19155230,Archives of disease in childhood,"Therapeutic hypothermia can be induced and maintained using either commercial water bottles or a ""phase changing material"" mattress in a newborn piglet model","BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia, a safe and effective treatment for neonatal encephalopathy in an intensive care setting, is not available in low-resource settings. Aims/ METHODS: To assess two low-tech, low-cost cooling devices for use in low-resource settings: (i) commercially available water bottles filled with tepid water (25 degrees C); (ii) a mattress made of phase changing material (PCM) with a melting point of 32 degrees C (PCM works as a heat buffer at this temperature). Eleven anaesthetised newborn piglets were studied following transient hypoxia-ischaemia. The cooling device was applied 2-26 h after hypoxia-ischaemia with a target rectal temperature (T(rectal)) of 33-34 degrees C. T(rectal) undershoot was adjusted using cotton blankets; the cooling device was renewed when T(rectal) rose above 35 degrees C. T(rectal) data during cooling were dichotomised (within or without target) to assess: (a) the total period within the target T(rectal) range; (b) the stability and fluctuation of T(rectal) during cooling. RESULTS: Therapeutic hypothermia was achieved with both water bottles (n = 5) and the PCM mattress (n = 6). The mean (SD) time to reach target T(rectal) was 1.8 (0.5) h with water bottles and 1.9 (0.3) h with PCM. PCM cooling led to a longer period within the target T(rectal) range (p<0.01) and more stable cooling (p<0.05). Water bottle cooling required device renewal (in four out of five piglets). CONCLUSION: Simple, low-tech cooling devices can induce and maintain therapeutic hypothermia effectively in a porcine model of neonatal encephalopathy, although frequent fine tuning by adjusting the number of blankets insulating the piglet was required to maintain a stable temperature. PCM may induce more stable cooling compared with water bottles.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1446,30943885,Stroke,Noninvasive Vagus Nerve Stimulation Prevents Ruptures and Improves Outcomes in a Model of Intracranial Aneurysm in Mice,"Background and Purpose- Inflammation is a critical determinant of aneurysmal wall destabilization, growth, and rupture risk. Targeting inflammation may suppress aneurysm rupture. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to suppress inflammation both systemically and in the central nervous system. Therefore, we tested the effect of a novel noninvasive transcutaneous VNS approach on aneurysm rupture and outcome in a mouse model of intracranial aneurysm formation with wall inflammation. Methods- Aneurysms were induced by a single stereotaxic injection of elastase into the cerebrospinal fluid at the skull base, combined with systemic deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, without or with high-salt diet, for mild or severe outcomes, respectively. Cervical VNS (two 2-minute stimulations 5 minutes apart) was delivered once a day starting from the day after elastase injection for the duration of follow-up. Transcutaneous stimulation of the femoral nerve (FNS) served as control. Multiple aneurysms developed in the circle of Willis and its major branches, resulting in spontaneous ruptures and subarachnoid hemorrhage, neurological deficits, and mortality. Results- In the milder model, VNS significantly reduced aneurysm rupture rate compared with FNS (29% versus 80%, respectively). Subarachnoid hemorrhage grades were also lower in the VNS group. In the more severe model, both VNS and FNS arms developed very high rupture rates (77% and 85%, respectively). However, VNS significantly improved the survival rate compared with FNS after rupture (median survival 13 versus 6 days, respectively), without diminishing the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades. Chronic daily VNS reduced MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) expression compared with FNS, providing a potential mechanism of action. As an important control, chronic daily VNS did not alter systemic arterial blood pressure compared with FNS. Conclusions- VNS can reduce aneurysm rupture rates and improve the outcome from ruptured aneurysms.",elastase| hypertension| inflammation| intracranial aneurysm| subarachnoid hemorrhage,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

The therapeutic potential of exercise training-induced changes in symbiotic gut microbiota against AD neuropathology is not well understood, yet. This study investigated the effects of a 20-week forced treadmill exercise program on the makeup of the gut microbiota, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the development of AD-like cognitive deficits and neuropathology in triple transgenic AD mice. Our findings show that forced treadmill running causes symbiotic changes in the gut microbiota, such as increased Akkermansia muciniphila and decreased Bacteroides species, as well as increased BBB-related protein expression and reduced AD-like cognitive impairments and neuropathology progression. The current findings of this animal study suggest that the interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain, possibly via the BBB, is responsible for exercise training-induced cognitive benefits and alleviation of AD pathology.",Blood-brain barrier| Cognitive function| Gut microbiome| Neuropathology| Physical exercise,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Oral treatment with the root extract resulted in a significant improvement in the mice's behavior and antioxidant status, along with a significant reduction in the level of lipid peroxidation. The results indicated that at least part of the chronic stress-induced pathology may be due to oxidative stress, which is mitigated by Ws.

Affected infants rarely survive longer than 2 years. Using the twitcher mouse model of the disease, this study evaluated the potential of intrastriatal injection of adipose or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a treatment option. Neonatal pups were injected with MSCs at 3-4 days of age and subjected to a battery of behavioral tests beginning at 15 days. While MSC injection failed to increase lifespan of twitchers, improvements in rotarod performance and twitching severity were observed at 27-38 days of age using MSCs derived from bone marrow. This study tested several different tasks developed in adult mice for evaluation of disease progression in immature twitchers. Rotarod was both reliable and extremely sensitive. Automated gait analysis using the Treadscan program was also useful for early evaluation of differences prior to overt gait dysfunction. Finally, this study represents the first use of the Stone T-maze in immature mice. Validation of rotarod and automated gait analysis for detection of subtle differences in disease progression is important for early stage efforts to develop treatments for juvenile disorders.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

A prospective, controlled study was performed in ten eyes of five rabbits with anatomically normal eyes. These eyes were divided into two groups according to the amount of slanted recession. In right eyes, slanted superior recti (SR) muscle recession was performed with 6 mm of nasal margin and 2 mm of temporal margin (4-mm slanting group), and in fellow eyes, slanted SR muscle recession was performed with 6 mm and 4 mm, respectively (2-mm slanting group). We measured both margins of superior recti from insertion, and calculated the amount of anterior creeping movement of both margins at 30, 60, and 90 postoperative days, and also compared the change of slanting degree of the SR muscle between the two groups.	Slanting degrees showed a gradual decrease in all rabbit eyes. In the 4-mm slanting group, each margin of anterior movement was 2.4.mm (nasal) and 0.9 mm (temporal) and slanting degrees decreased in 50 -7 5%. In the 2-mm slanting group, the margins of anterior movement were 2.9 mm and 1.8 mm respectively, and slanting degrees decreased in 25 ∼ 50%. The amount of slanting degree showed a greater decrease in the 4-mm group than in the 2-mm group at postoperative 3 months (p = 0.045).	Both margins of extraocular muscle in slanted recession showed anterior movement at postoperative 3 months; therefore, the effectiveness of slanted recession might be decreased postoperatively.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1451,30181106,Brain stimulation,The neuroprotective effect of deep brain stimulation at nucleus basalis of Meynert in transgenic mice with Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and mainly treated by drugs, while the therapeutic outcomes are very limited. This study aimed to determine the optimized parameters of deep brain stimulation (DBS) which was applied to the treatment of AD and propose the involved mechanisms. METHODS: Amyloid-β precursor protein/Presenilin1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were used and received DBS at nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). The optimized parameters of DBS were determined by using different stimulation frequencies, durations and ages of mice under Morris water maze test. The involved mechanisms and the possible signal pathways were also investigated. RESULTS: The optimized parameters for DBS were high frequency (100 Hz) for 21 days starting from early age (4 months old). Under the above parameters, the soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus and cortex were down-regulated significantly. DBS increased survival neurons and reduced apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and cortex. Meanwhile, the apoptosis-related proteins caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bid were down-regulated. Moreover, DBS caused a significant increase of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and choline acetyltransferase activity as well as a decrease of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde content and acetylcholine esterase activity. Phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt)/total Akt (t-Akt) was up-regulated while p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/t-ERK1/2 was down-regulated. The neuroprotective effect of DBS was attenuated by their inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS starting from 4 months of age for 21 days at a high frequency (100 Hz) has therapeutic effects on AD through activating phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and inhibiting ERK1/2 pathway.",APP/PS1 transgenic mice| Alzheimer's disease| Deep brain stimulation| Morris water maze| Nucleus basalis of Meynert,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1452,38122903,Behavioural brain research,Impact of voluntary exercise training on the metabolic and behavioral characteristics of the rTg4510 transgenic mouse model of frontotemporal dementia,"Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, primarily in individuals under 65 years of age, and is the second most common form of dementia worldwide. There is no cure for FTD and current treatments offer limited symptomatic relief. Regular physical activity exhibits cognitive and neuroprotective benefits in healthy individuals and in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but few studies have examined its efficacy in FTD. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of voluntary exercise training (VET) on the metabolic and behavioral characteristics of the rTg4510 transgenic mouse model of familial FTD. We show that regardless of genotype, VET increased energy expenditure, decreased sleep duration, and improved long-term memory in rTg4510 mice and WT littermates. Moreover, VET appeared to improve hyperactivity, a common feature of FTD, in rTg4510 mice. Although further work is required, these findings provide important insights into the potential benefits of physical activity in FTD.",Cognitive impairment| Exercise metabolism| Frontotemporal dementia,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1453,21114367,Physiological research,Rehabilitation intervention in animal model can improve neuromotor and cognitive functions after traumatic brain injury: pilot study.,"The aim of the present study was to quantify the effect of multisensory rehabilitation on rats' cognition after an experimental brain trauma and to assess its possible clinical implications. The complex intermittent multisensory rehabilitation consisted of currently used major therapeutic procedures targeted at the improvement of cognitive functions; including multisensory and motor stimulation and enriched environment. We have confirmed this positive effect of early multisensory rehabilitation on the recovery of motor functions after traumatic brain injury. However, we have been able to prove a positive effect on the recovery of cognitive functions only with respect to the frequency of efficient search strategies in a Barnes maze test, while results for search time and travelled distance were not significantly different between study groups. We have concluded that the positive effects of an early treatment of functional deficits are comparable with the clinical results in early neurorehabilitation in human patients after brain trauma. It might therefore be reasonable to apply these experimental results to human medical neurorehabilitation care.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

In our research, the AD mouse model was stimulated using light with various parameters [continuous wave (PBM) or 40 Hz pulsed visible LED (GVS) or 40 Hz pulsed 808 nm LED (PBM and GVS treatment)]]. The brain slices collected from the LS treated AD model mice were evaluated using (i) fluorescence microscopy to image thioflavine-S labeled amy-loid-β (Aβ) plaques (the main hallmark of AD), or (ii) two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) imaging of unlabeled Aβ plaques, showing that the amount of Aβ plaques was reduced after LS treatment. The imaging results correlated well with the results of Morris water maze (MWM) test, which demonstrated that the spatial learning and memory abilities of LS treated mice were noticeably higher than those of untreated mice. The LS effect was also assessed by in vivo nonlinear optical imaging, revealing that the cerebral amyloid angiopathy decreased spe-cifically as a result of 40 Hz pulsed 808 nm irradiation, on the contrary, the angiopathy reversed after visible 40 Hz pulsed light treatment.

Limited human studies suggested that scalp acupuncture could facilitate functional recovery after cerebral hemorrhage. In the current study, we used an animal model of cerebral hemorrhage to examine the potential effects of scalp acupuncture. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received autologous blood (50μL) into the right caudate nucleus on the right side under pentobarbital anesthesia, and then received scalp acupuncture (DU20 through GB7 on the lesion side) or sham acupuncture (1cm to the right side of the acupoints) (n=10 per group). A group of rats receiving autologous blood into the caudate nucleus but no other intervention, as well as a group of rats receiving anesthesia but no blood injection to the brain (n=10 per group) were included as additional controls. Composite neuroscore, corner turn test, forelimb placing test, wire hang task and beam walking were used to evaluate the behavior of rats. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the histopathological changes. Western blot was used to detect the content of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-KappaB (NFκB) protein expression. RESULTS: Scalp acupuncture attenuated neurological deficits (p<0.01 or <0.05 vs. sham acupuncture using a variety of behavioral tests) at 1-7days after the treatment. The brain content of TNF-α and NFκB was decreased (p<0.01 for both).

1456,21606375,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,ES cell-derived renewable and functional midbrain dopaminergic progenitors.,"During early development, midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neuronal progenitors (NPs) arise from the ventral mesencephalic area by the combined actions of secreted factors and their downstream transcription factors. These mDA NPs proliferate, migrate to their final destinations, and develop into mature mDA neurons in the substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area. Here, we show that such authentic mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated from differentiated ES cells (ESCs) using a FACS method combining two markers, Otx2 and Corin. Purified Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells coexpressed other mDA NP markers, including FoxA2, Lmx1b, and Glast. Using optimized culture conditions, these mDA NPs continuously proliferated up to 4 wk with almost 1,000-fold expansion without significant changes in their phenotype. Furthermore, upon differentiation, Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells efficiently generated mDA neurons, as evidenced by coexpression of mDA neuronal markers (e.g., TH, Pitx3, Nurr1, and Lmx1b) and physiological functions (e.g., efficient DA secretion and uptake). Notably, these mDA NPs differentiated into a relatively homogenous DA population with few serotonergic neurons. When transplanted into PD model animals, aphakia mice, and 6-OHDA-lesioned rats, mDA NPs differentiated into mDA neurons in vivo and generated well-integrated DA grafts, resulting in significant improvement in motor dysfunctions without tumor formation. Furthermore, grafted Otx2(+)Corin(+) cells exhibited significant migratory function in the host striatum, reaching >3.3 mm length in the entire striatum. We propose that functional and expandable mDA NPs can be efficiently isolated by this unique strategy and will serve as useful tools in regenerative medicine, bioassay, and drug screening.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

This study determined whether a continuous or intermittent KD (IKD) enhanced cognitive behavior in the TgF344-AD rat model of AD. At 6 months-old, TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) littermates were placed on a control (CD), KD, or IKD (morning CD and afternoon KD) provided as two meals per day for 2 or 6 months. Cognitive and motor behavior and circulating β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), AD biomarkers and blood lipids were assessed. Animals on a KD diet had elevated circulating BHB, with IKD levels intermediate to CD and KD. TgF344-AD rats displayed impaired spatial learning memory in the Barnes maze at 8 and 12 months of age and impaired motor coordination at 12 months of age. Neither KD nor IKD improved performance compared to CD. At 12 months of age, TgF344-AD animals had elevated blood lipids. IKD reduced lipids to WT levels with KD further reducing cholesterol below WT levels. This study shows that at 8 or 12 months of age, KD or IKD intervention did not improve measures of cognitive or motor behavior in TgF344-AD rats; however, both IKD and KD positively impacted circulating lipids.",Alzheimer’s disease| cognitive behavior| ketogenic diet| lipids| motor function,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

However, because of the limited resource of embryos, greater attention is needed in developing more efficient surgical techniques that not only enhance the therapy outcome but also avoid inefficient therapeutics of transplantation. In this study, we explored the curative effects of two different transplantation methods using a rat model of HD. Whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) cells or phosphate-buffered saline were transplanted into unilateral striatum of quinolinic acid (QA)-lesioned rats using microtransplantation instruments (with an outer diameter of 50 μm) or traditional transplantation instruments (with an outer diameter of 470 μm). Apomorphine-induced rotation test and adjusting step test were assessed after QA-induced lesion and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks after transplantation. The expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN), dopamine, cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was analyzed at 12 weeks after transplantation. We observed that microtransplanted rats performed better in the stepping test and had higher numbers of DARPP-32-positive cells compared with traditionally transplanted rats. Moreover, microtransplantation group showed lower GFAP expression surrounding the grafts in unilateral striatum and a higher survival rate posttransplantation compared with the traditional transplantation group. We conclude that microtransplantation is capable of enhancing therapeutic efficacy in the rat model of HD.

We investigated whether treatment with BVA (0.25 and 0.8 mg/kg) at the Zusanli (ST36) acupoints, located lateral from the anterior border of the tibia, has a beneficial effect in a myelin basic protein (MBP)(68-82)-induced acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rat model. Pretreatment (every 3 days from 1 h before immunization) with BVA was more effective than posttreatment (daily after immunization) with BVA with respect to clinical signs (neurological impairment and loss of body weight) of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint in normal rats did not induce the clinical signs. Pretreatment with BVA suppressed demyelination, glial activation, expression of cytokines [interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-17, IL-17A, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and IL-1β], chemokines [RANTES, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α], and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB (p65 and phospho-IκBα) signaling pathways in the spinal cord of acute EAE rats. Pretreatment with BVA decreased the number of CD4(+), CD4(+)/IFN-γ(+), and CD4(+)/IL-17(+) T cells, but increased the number of CD4(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells in the spinal cord and lymph nodes of acute EAE rats. Treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints (SP9, GB39, and four non-acupoints) did not have a positive effect in acute EAE rats. Interestingly, onset and posttreatment with BVA at the ST36 acupoint markedly attenuated neurological impairment in myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)(35-55)-induced chronic EAE mice compared to treatment with BVA at six placebo acupoints. Our findings strongly suggest that treatment with BVA with ST36 acupoint could delay or attenuate the development and progression of EAE by upregulating regulatory T cells and suppressing T-helper (Th) 17 and Th1 responses. These results warrant further investigation of BVA as a treatment for autoimmune disorders of the central nervous system.",Bee venom acupuncture| Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis| Immune cell,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Therefore, there is an urgent need to find neuroprotective approaches that can be combined with reperfusion to maximize efficacy. Here, the neuroprotective mechanisms behind therapeutic hypothermia were evaluated in a monkey model of ischemic stroke. Focal ischemia was induced in adult rhesus monkeys by placing autologous clots in the middle cerebral artery. Monkeys were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) alone or t-PA plus selective intra-arterial cooling (SI-AC). Serial MRI scans and functional deficit were evaluated after ischemia. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry analysis were performed after the final MRI scan. t-PA plus SI-AC treatment led to a higher rate of MRI tissue rescue, and significantly improved neurologic deficits and daily activity scores compared with t-PA alone. In peri-infarct areas, higher fractional anisotropy values and greater fiber numbers were observed in models receiving t-PA plus SI-AC. Histological findings indicated that myelin damage, spheroids, and spongiosis were significantly ameliorated in models receiving SI-AC treatment. White matter integrity was also improved by SI-AC based on immunochemical staining. Our study demonstrates that SI-AC can be effectively combined with t-PA to improve both structural and functional recovery in a monkey model of focal ischemia. These findings provide proof-of-concept that it may be feasible to add neuroprotective agents as adjunctive treatments to reperfusion therapy for stroke.",Stroke| diffusion tensor imaging| hypothermia| recovery| rhesus monkey| white matter,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Although it has devastating outcomes for patients and tremendous economic costs to society, there is currently no effective treatment available. AIMS: The high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for refractory epilepsy with a proven efficacy. Although the considerable interest has emerged in recent years for applying KD in AD patients, only few interventional studies in animals and humans have addressed the effects of KD on cognitive impairments, and the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of KD on cognitive functions and AD pathology in 5XFAD mice-a validated animal model of AD. RESULTS: Four months of a ketogenic diet improved spatial learning, spatial memory and working memory in 5XFAD mice. The improvement in cognitive functions was associated with a restored number of neurons and synapses in both the hippocampus and the cortex. Ketogenic diet treatment also reduced amyloid plaque deposition and microglial activation, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation. The positive effect of ketogenic diet on cognitive functions depended on the starting time and the duration of the diet. A shorter period (2 months) of ketogenic diet treatment had a weaker effect. Ketogenic diet initiated at late stage of AD (9 months of age) displayed no effect on cognitive improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate positive effects of ketogenic diet on both cognitive function and histopathology in Alzheimer's disease, which could be due to reduced microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our findings provide new insights and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer's disease| cognitive impairment| ketogenic diet| microglial activation| neuroinflammation,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1462,29969470,PloS one,The duration of hypothermia affects short-term neuroprotection in a mouse model of neonatal hypoxic ischaemic injury,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Therapeutic hypothermia is standard clinical care for moderate hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury, however it reduces the risk of death and disability only by 11% and 40% of the treated infants still develop disabilities. Thus it is necessary to develop supplementary therapies to complement therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of neonatal HIE. The modified Rice-Vannucci model of HI in the neonatal mouse is well developed and widely applied with different periods of hypothermia used as neuroprotective strategy in combination with other agents. However, different studies use different periods, time of initiation and duration of hypothermia following HI, with subsequent varying degrees of neuroprotection. So far most rodent data is obtained using exposure to 5-6h of therapeutic hypothermia. Our aim was to compare the effect of exposure to three different short periods of hypothermia (1h, 1.5h and 2h) following HI insult in the postnatal day 7 C57/Bl6 mouse, and to determine the shortest period providing neuroprotection. Our data suggests that 1h and 1.5h of hypothermia delayed by 20min following a 60min exposure to 8%O2 do not prove neuroprotective. However, 2h of hypothermia significantly reduced tissue loss, TUNEL+ cell death and microglia and astroglia activation. We also observed improved functional outcome 7 days after HI. We suggest that the minimal period of cooling necessary to provide moderate short term neuroprotection and appropriate for the development and testing of combined treatment is 2h.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Primary neurons were isolated and cultured. Sprague‑Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups and fed diets with different amounts of n‑3 PUFAs. A model of spinal cord contusion was created at the T10 spinal segment and the composition of PUFAs was analyzed using gas chromatography. Spinal repair and motor function were evaluated postoperatively. Assessment of the effects of n‑3 PUFAs on autophagy and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) was performed using immunofluorescence staining and western blotting. In vitro, n‑3 PUFAs inhibited mTORC1 and enhanced autophagy. The n‑3 PUFA levels and the ratio of n‑3 PUFA to n‑6 PUFA in the spinal cord and serum of rats fed a high‑n‑3 PUFA diet were higher before and after operation (P<0.05). Additionally, rats in the high‑n‑3 PUFA group showed improved motor function recovery, spinal cord repair‑related protein expression level (MBP, Galc and GFAP). Expression levels if these protiens in the high‑n‑3 PUFA diet group expressed the highest levels, followed by the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group and finally the control group (P<0.05). high‑n‑3 PUFA diet promoted autophagy ability and inhibited activity of the mTORC1 signaling pathway compared with the low‑n‑3 PUFA diet group or the control group (P<0.05). These results suggest that exogenous dietary n‑3 PUFAs can inhibit mTORC1 signaling and enhance autophagy, promoting functional recovery of rats with SCI.",polyunsaturated fatty acids| spinal cord injury| mammalian target of rapamycin| autophagy| locomotor recovery,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

EAE, an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is regarded as a model for multiple sclerosis. When severe paresis had developed, rats were treated with high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and transplanted with syngeneic BM from healthy donors. Nine Gy TBI followed by syngeneic BMT greatly accelerated recovery of paresis compared with untreated controls. In 6-33% of the treated animals a relapse of EAE was observed shortly after treatment. Reimmunization 20 days after treatment, resulted in a relapse in 12-44% of the rats. Employing the maximally tolerated dose of TBI (10 Gy) did not significantly alter the incidence of spontaneous or induced relapses. Furthermore, it was shown that irradiation of the CNS only was not sufficient for the induction of complete regression of paresis.

1467,17524565,Neuroscience,Functional recovery in rats with ischemic paraplegia after spinal grafting of human spinal stem cells.,"Transient spinal cord ischemia in humans can lead to the development of permanent paraplegia with prominent spasticity and rigidity. Histopathological analyses of spinal cords in animals with ischemic spastic paraplegia show a selective loss of small inhibitory interneurons in previously ischemic segments but with a continuing presence of ventral alpha-motoneurons and descending cortico-spinal and rubro-spinal projections. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of human spinal stem cells (hSSCs) implanted spinally in rats with fully developed ischemic paraplegia on the recovery of motor function and corresponding changes in motor evoked potentials. In addition the optimal time frame for cell grafting after ischemia and the optimal dosing of grafted cells were also studied. Spinal cord ischemia was induced for 10 min using aortic occlusion and systemic hypotension. In the functional recovery study, hSSCs (10,000-30,000 cells/0.5 mul/injection) were grafted into spinal central gray matter of L2-L5 segments at 21 days after ischemia. Animals were immunosuppressed with Prograf (1 mg/kg or 3 mg/kg) for the duration of the study. After cell grafting the recovery of motor function was assessed periodically using the Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan (BBB) scoring system and correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. At predetermined times after grafting (2-12 weeks), animals were perfusion-fixed and the survival, and maturation of implanted cells were analyzed using antibodies recognizing human-specific antigens: nuclear protein (hNUMA), neural cell adhesion molecule (hMOC), neuron-specific enolase (hNSE) and synapthophysin (hSYN) as well as the non-human specific antibodies TUJ1, GFAP, GABA, GAD65 and GLYT2. After cell grafting a time-dependent improvement in motor function and suppression of spasticity and rigidity was seen and this improvement correlated with the recovery of motor evoked potentials. Immunohistochemical analysis of grafted lumbar segments at 8 and 12 weeks after grafting revealed intense hNSE immunoreactivity, an extensive axo-dendritic outgrowth as well as rostrocaudal and dorsoventral migration of implanted hNUMA-positive cells. An intense hSYN immunoreactivity was identified within the grafts and in the vicinity of persisting alpha-motoneurons. On average, 64% of hSYN terminals were GAD65 immunoreactive which corresponded to GABA immunoreactivity identified in 40-45% of hNUMA-positive grafted cells. The most robust survival of grafted cells was seen when cells were grafted 21 days after ischemia. As defined by cell survival and laminar distribution, the optimal dose of injected cells was 10,000-30,000 cells per injection. These data indicate that spinal grafting of hSSCs can represent an effective therapy for patients with spinal ischemic paraplegia.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

In this study, we explored whether a higher NIr dose (125J) generated beneficial effects in the same MPTP monkey model (n=15). We implanted an NIr (670nm) optical fibre device within a midline region of the midbrain in macaque monkeys, close to the substantia nigra of both sides. MPTP injections (1.8-2.1mg/kg) were made over a five day period, during which time the NIr device was turned on and left on continuously throughout the ensuing three week survival period. Monkeys were evaluated clinically and their brains processed for immunohistochemistry and stereology. Our results showed that the higher NIr dose did not have any toxic impact on cells at the midbrain implant site. Further, this NIr dose resulted in a higher number of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells when compared to the MPTP group. However, the higher NIr dose monkeys showed little evidence for an increase in mean clinical score, number of nigral Nissl-stained cells and density of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase terminations. In summary, the higher NIr dose of 125J was not as beneficial to MPTP-treated monkeys as compared to the lower doses of 25J and 35J, boding well for strategies of NIr dose delivery and device energy consumption in a future clinical trial.",670nm| Behaviour| MPTP| Macaque monkeys| Substantia nigra| Tyrosine hydroxylase,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a means of noninvasive brain stimulation and a potential therapeutic tool for modulating behavioral flexibility. Animal studies can pave the way to know if tDCS application can potentially benefit rule- and goal-based activities in ADHD. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and inbred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as an animal model of ADHD and controls, respectively, and their strategy set-shifting abilities, including initial discrimination, set-shifting, and reversal learning tasks under 0-s or 15-s reinforcer delivery delay conditions, were evaluated. The tDCS treatment had a limited effect on the performance of the SHRs and WKY rats in initial discrimination task under 0-s delay condition. Under the 15-s delay condition, the SHRs had longer lever-press reaction times and/or more trial omissions than the WKY rats did when completing set-shifting and reversal-learning tasks.

1471,27081159,Physiological reports,Monitoring of cerebral blood flow during hypoxia-ischemia and resuscitation in the neonatal rat using laser speckle imaging.,"Neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is associated with alterations in cerebral blood flow (CBF) as a result of perinatal asphyxia. The extent to whichCBFchanges contribute to injury, and whether treatments that ameliorate these changes might be neuroprotective, is still unknown. Higher throughput techniques to monitorCBFchanges in rodent models ofHIEcan help elucidate the underlying pathophysiology. We developed a laser speckle imaging (LSI) technique to continuously monitorCBFin six postnatal-day 10 (P10) rats simultaneously before, during, and after unilateral hypoxia-ischemia (HI, ligation of the left carotid artery followed by hypoxia in 8% oxygen). After ligation,CBFto the ligated side fell by 30% compared to the unligated side (P < 0.0001). Hypoxia induced a bilateral 55% reduction inCBF, which was partially restored by resuscitation. Compared to resuscitation in air, resuscitation in 100% oxygen increasedCBFto the ligated side by 45% (P = 0.033). Individual variability inCBFresponse to hypoxia between animals accounted for up to 24% of the variability in hemispheric area loss to the ligated side. In both P10 and P7 models of unilateralHI, resuscitation in 100% oxygen did not affect hemispheric area loss, or hippocampalCA1 pyramidal neuron counts, after 1-week survival. ContinuousCBFmonitoring usingLSIin multiple rodents simultaneously can screen potential treatment modalities that affectCBF, and provide insight into the pathophysiology ofHI.",Cerebral blood flow| hypoxia‐ischemia| neonatal| oxygen| resuscitation,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1472,21232055,Developmental medicine and child neurology,Effects of constraint-induced movement therapy on neurogenesis and functional recovery after early hypoxic-ischemic injury in mice,"AIM: Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving affected upper limb function in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). However, little is known about the changes in the brain that are induced by CIMT. This study was designed to investigate these changes and behavioural performance after CIMT intervention in mice with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. METHOD: We utilized the neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury model established in mice pups. Three weeks after the injury, the mice were randomly assigned to the following three groups: the control group (n = 15), the enriched-environment group (n = 17), and the CIMT with an enriched-environment group (CIMT-EE, n = 15). 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected daily to label proliferating cells during the 2 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: The CIMT-EE group showed better fall rate in the horizontal ladder rung walking test (mean 5.4%, SD 3.6%) than either the control (mean 14.3%, SD 7.3%; p = 0.001) or enriched-environment (mean 12.4%, SD 7.7%; p = 0.010) groups 2 weeks after the end of intervention. The CIMT-EE group also showed more neurogenesis (mean 7069 cells/mm³, SD 4017 cells/mm³) than either the control group (mean 1555 cells/mm³, SD 1422 cells/mm³; p < 0.001) or enriched-environment group (mean 2994 cells/mm³, SD 3498 cells/mm³; p = 0.001) in the subventricular zone. In the striatum, neurogenesis in the CIMT-EE group (mean 534 cells/mm³, SD 441 cells/mm³) was greater than in the control group (mean 95 cells/mm³, SD 133 cells/mm³; p = 0.001). INTERPRETATION: There was CIMT-EE enhanced neurogenesis in the brain along with functional benefits in mice after early hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of CIMT on neurogenesis and functional recovery after experimental injury to an immature brain.",,Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
1473,125578,The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry,A double blind trial of lithium carbonate and haloperidol in Huntington's chorea,"Six patients with a family history of Huntington's chorea (HC) participated in a double blind crossover trial involving four treatments--lithium carbonate, haloperidol, lithium carbonate and haloperidol, and placebo. Each treatment was administered for three weeks and, at the end of each treatment period, assessments were made of chorea and a number of psychological variables. None of the treatments significantly affected chorea measurements. With regard to the psychological variables, the levels of irritability, the frequency of angry outbursts and depression did appear to be affected in some patients by the treatment. Three patients improved on a combination of lithium carbonate and haloperidol while the remaining three did not. Haloperidol alone significantly raised depression ratings above levels for other treatments including placebo. It is suggested that lithium carbonate and haloperidol together should be seriously considered in the treatment of HC when patients are excessively irritable and impulsive.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

METHODS: A total of 135 patients with HD were randomized to enter a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of 2 g/d ethyl-EPA vs placebo. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) was used for assessment. The primary end point was outcome at 12 months on the Total Motor Score 4 subscale (TMS-4). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a chi2 test on response, defined as absence of increase in the TMS-4, were performed. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients completed 12 months, and 83 did so without protocol violations (PP cohort). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed no significant difference between ethyl-EPA and placebo for TMS-4. In the PP cohort, ethyl-EPA proved better than placebo on the chi2 test on TMS-4 (p < 0.05), but missed significance on ANCOVA (p = 0.06). Secondary end points (ITT cohort) showed no benefit of ethyl-EPA but a significantly worse outcome in the behavioral severity and frequency compared with placebo. Exploring moderators of the efficacy of ethyl-EPA on TMS-4 showed a significant interaction between treatment and a factor defining patients with high vs low CAG repeats. Reported adverse events were distributed equally between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (ethyl-EPA) (purity > 95%) had no benefit in the intent-to-treat cohort of patients with Huntington disease, but exploratory analysis revealed that a significantly higher number of patients in the per protocol cohort, treated with ethyl-EPA, showed stable or improved motor function.

We examined whether intranasal insulin offered a beneficial effect across measures of cognitive function in adults with MDD. METHODS: Thirty-five adults (18-65 years of age: 47.09±9.89) meeting criteria for a major depressive episode as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV-Treatment Revised were included in this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study.

Subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of either intranasal insulin 40 International Units (IU) taken four times a day (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and before bed) (QID) (n=19) or placebo (n=16). RESULTS: No between group differences were observed in change from baseline on total Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (25.98±2.81), in either of the Positive or Negative subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), or on a global index of neurocognition. The possibility of practice and/or carry over effect could not be excluded.

During the double-blind phase 174 patients received pramipexole and 180 placebo. In agreement with previous studies, pramipexole treatment improved UPDRS sum scores of parts II and III by 30% and off times by approximately 2.5 hours per day. Differences between the treatment groups became significant at a daily dose of 0.75 mg of pramipexole dihydrochloride. We, furthermore, performed post hoc analyses with respect to resting tremor and depression. Patients with pronounced resting tremor derived a clear benefit from pramipexole treatment compared with placebo. In addition, pramipexole significantly improved the subitems motivation/initiative and depression in a subpopulation with increased Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I scores at the time of inclusion. There were 262 patients who were subsequently enrolled into the open-label study featuring a maximum duration of up to 57 months. Statistical analysis revealed good long-term efficacy and tolerability of pramipexole. Overall, only a low prevalence of somnolence was found. In summary, this study provides additional level I evidence of the usefulness of pramipexole, suggests a particular tremorlytic and a possible antidepressant action of this compound, and addresses for the first time its efficacy and safety during long-term administration in advanced PD.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1477,3962762,Age and ageing,Low-dose subcutaneous heparin in the prevention of deep-vein thrombosis and pulmonary emboli following acute stroke.,"Venous thrombo-embolism is a major and often unrecognized cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after acute strokes. Three hundred and five elderly patients were randomly allocated to either control (161) or treatment (144) with 5000 units calcium heparin subcutaneously 8-hourly for two weeks. A reduction in deep-vein thrombosis rate from 72.7% in the control group to 22.2% in treatment patients was achieved. In patients who died (84), post-mortem examination to look for pulmonary emboli was performed in 71. Comparison between treated and untreated patients showed significantly fewer deaths and pulmonary emboli in the treated group. Most of the beneficial effect on mortality was seen in patients with lighter strokes. When patients with pulmonary emboli at post-mortem were excluded, there was no significant difference in the death rate in treatment (17) and control (14) groups. At post-mortem, 9.9% of the strokes were haemorrhagic (4 in the treatment and 3 in the control group). Low-dose calcium heparin given subcutaneously following acute stroke reduced the number of deep-vein thromboses, pulmonary emboli and deaths without increasing the number of haemorrhagic strokes in this study.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

DESIGN: Prospective, randomised, multicentre, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group trial. Patients received either placebo, 1-4 mg/day (lower dose) rivastigmine, or 6-12 mg/day (higher dose) rivastigmine. Doses were increased in one of two fixed dose ranges (1-4 mg/day or 6-12 mg/day) over the first 12 weeks with a subsequent assessment period of 14 weeks. SETTING: 45 centres in Europe and North America. PARTICIPANTS: 725 patients with mild to moderately severe probable Alzheimer's disease diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, and the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale, rating on the clinician interview based impression of change incorporating caregiver information scale, and the progressive deterioration scale. RESULTS: At the end of the study cognitive function had deteriorated among those in the placebo group. Scores on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale improved in patients in the higher dose group when compared with patients taking placebo (P<0.05). Significantly more patients in the higher dose group had improved by 4 points or more than had improved in the placebo group (24% (57/242) v 16% (39/238)). Global function as rated by the clinician interview scale had significantly improved among those in the higher dose group compared with those taking placebo (P<0.001), and significantly more patients in the higher dose group showed improvement than did in the placebo group (37% (80/219) v 20% (46/230)). Mean scores on the progressive deterioration scale improved from baseline in patients in the higher dose group but fell in the placebo group. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, of mild to moderate severity, transient, and occurred mainly during escalation of the dose. 23% (55/242) of those in the higher dose group, 7% (18/242) of those in the lower dose group, and 7% (16/239) of those in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine is well tolerated and effective. It improves cognition, participation in activities of daily living, and global evaluation ratings in patients with mild to moderately severe Alzheimer's disease.

Of the 31 patients, 16 randomly received add-on melatonin, whereas 15 received add-on placebo. The questionnaire showed good internal consistency in our patient population (Cronbach's alpha = .83). The percentage decrease in the median total sleep score was 24.4 (range 0.0-34.9) in the valproate + melatonin group compared with 14.0 (range -2.2-18.8) in the valproate + placebo group, the difference being statistically significant (P < .05). The median percentage decrease in the parasomnias score was 60 (range 0.0-70.8) in the valproate + melatonin group compared with 36.4 (range 0.0-63.2) in the valproate + placebo group, the difference being statistically significant (P < .05). There was no significant difference between the percentage decrease in the daytime drowsiness scores and sleep fragmentation scores. Parent-child interaction subscale scores were not significantly different between age groups. The age at onset of seizures and the type of seizures did not correlate significantly to the total sleep scores. Given that sleep problems are known to complicate epilepsy, add-on melatonin, which has a wide safety window, can be of promise in the pharmacotherapy of pediatric epilepsy.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial followed by open-label extension. SETTING: 40 US centers. PATIENTS: Adults with closed TBI (N = 117), Glasgow Coma Scale score >8 at time of injury; baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ≥10; sleep latency <8 minutes on multiple sleep latency test (MSLT); and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥4 for excessive sleepiness. INTERVENTION: Patients received armodafinil (50, 150, or 250 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks followed by an optional 12-month open-label extension. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Outcomes included MSLT, ESS, Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), TBI-Work Instability Scale (TBI-WIS), CGI-S, and tolerability. The study was terminated early due to low enrollment. Patients receiving 250 mg armodafinil showed significant improvement in sleep latency from baseline to final visit versus placebo (+7.2 minutes vs. +2.4 minutes; p = 0.0010). CGI-C ratings were much/ very much improved in approximately 50% of patients receiving 150 and 250 mg armodafinil, compared to 38% on placebo. ESS and TBI-WIS scores were not significantly different between groups. In the open-label extension (N = 49), patients demonstrated gradual improvement in ESS, TBI-WIS, and CGI-S scores up to 48 weeks post-baseline. Armodafinil was generally well tolerated, with headache the most common adverse event in both double-blind and open-label portions. CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil 250 mg significantly improved sleep latency in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with mild or moderate TBI.

However, the effects of statins on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been determined. OBJECTIVE: Considering that plasma Aβ are related to Aβ deposition in the brain, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on plasma Aβ transport. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and twenty patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of simvastatin per day or matching placebo for 12 weeks (sixty patients per group). Plasma Aβ, sLRP1, sRAGE, and lipid levels were measured at baseline and at the 6-week and 12-week visits. RESULTS: The ITT database ultimately included 108 participants (placebo group: n = 53; simvastatin group: n = 55) and 64 (59.3%) were women, ranging in age from 45 to 75 years (mean 57.2±6.9 years). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, after 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with the placebo group, ΔAβ42 levels (the change of Aβ42 levels from baseline at week 12) increased more and ΔsRAGE levels decreased more in the simvastatin group (Aβ42: β= 5.823, p = 0.040; sRAGE: β= -72.012, p = 0.031), and a significant negative association was found between ΔAβ42 and ΔsRAGE levels (β= -0.115, p = 0.045). In addition, generalized estimation equation analysis showed that triglycerides levels were negatively correlated with Aβ40 (β= -16.79, p = 0.023), Aβ42 (β= -6.10, p = 0.001), and sRAGE (β= -51.16, p = 0.003). CONCLUSION: Daily oral simvastatin (40 mg/day) in patients with hyperlipidemia for 12 weeks can significantly increase plasma Aβ42 levels compared with placebo, which was associated with reduced triglycerides and sRAGE levels, indicating that statins may affect plasma Aβ transport.",Alzheimer’s disease| hyperlipidemia| plasma amyloid-β| simvastatin| soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1| soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

METHODS: In this 11-week randomized, active-controlled, rater-blinded phase III study, eligible patients were randomly assigned to either receive piribedil or to continue on pramipexole or ropinirole. The primary outcome was the median reaction times during the second 15 minutes of the subtest ""vigilance"" of the Test battery for Attention Performances (TAP). Secondary outcomes included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, neuropsychological testing, and items of the Clinical Global Impression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients received piribedil; 36 continued on either pramipexole or ropinirole. There was no difference in the primary end point reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance between piribedil and the comparator (996 vs 954 milliseconds, P = 0.68). Piribedil reduced daytime sleepiness with lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores at the end of treatment compared with the comparator (-4 vs -2 points; P = 0.01). The median Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score at the end of treatment was comparable between the 2 groups. Neuropsychological tests revealed no significant between-treatment differences. A higher therapeutic effect and global improvement were shown by the Clinical Global Impression of piribedil-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that switching from pramipexole or ropinirole to piribedil has no effect on the reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance but upholds the same therapeutic motor effect and reduces daytime sleepiness to a clinically relevant degree in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Ubiquitous brain expression of PPAR delta, its critical role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like phenotype of PPAR delta null mice motivated this study. OBJECTIVE: To determine safety and tolerability of multiple doses of T3D-959 in subjects with mild to moderate AD, examine systemic and central drug pharmacology and in an exploratory manner, perform cognitive assessments. METHODS: Thirty-four subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were orally administered 3, 10, 30, or 90 mg of T3D-959 daily for 14 days. There was no inclusion of a placebo arm. Safety and tolerability were monitored. Systemic drug pharmacology was examined via plasma metabolomics LC-MS-MS analysis, cerebral drug pharmacology via FDG-PET measures of changes in Relative CMRgl (R CMRgl, AD-effected regions relative to brain reference regions), and cognitive function assessed before and after drug treatment and again one week after completion of drug treatment, by ADAS-cog11 and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). RESULTS: T3D-959 was in general safe and well tolerated. Single point pharmacokinetics at the Tmax showed dose dependent exposure. Plasma metabolome profile changes showed dose-dependent systemic effects on lipid metabolism and metabolism related to insulin sensitization. Relative FDG-PET imaging demonstrated dose-dependent, regional, effects of T3D-959 on R CMRgl based on the use of multiple reference regions. ADAS-cog11 and DSST cognitive assessments showed improvements with possible ApoE genotype association and pharmacodynamics related to the mechanism of drug action.

During weeks 4 to 7 these two groups were each randomly split into treatment by relaxation or by exposure in vivo, and during weeks 7 to 10 all patients had exposure in vivo. Double blind assessments were made at weeks 4, 7, 10, 18, 36, 62 and 114. Results are reported to one year. Clomipramine produced significant improvement in rituals, mood and social adjustment, but only in those patients who initially had depressed mood. The clomipramine effect was maximum from weeks 10 to 18 and diminished thereafter. On stopping clomipramine patients often relapsed and improved again on restarting the drug. Relaxation produced little change. Exposure produced significant lasting improvement in rituals, but less change in mood; improvement generalized to social adjustment at follow-up. Clomipramine plus exposure had a slight additive but not interactional effect. Clomipramine enhanced compliance both with exposure and with relaxation. Clomipramine is useful for compulsive ritualizers with depressed mood, but may need continuation for over a year and combination with exposure in vivo. Exposure in vivo remains the treatment of choice for rituals without depressed mood.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Previously, we reported preclinical evidence that the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is FDA approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has potential benefits on cognition, structural and molecular markers of ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate in a pilot clinical trial, using neuroimaging biomarkers, the potential efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared to placebo. A 6-month phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two sites. Participants consisted of males and females, 50 to 95 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, and Mini-Mental State Examination between 19 and 27. Ninety-four participants were screened, 50 participants who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg riluzole (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) twice a day. Twenty-two riluzole-treated and 20 placebo participants completed the study. Primary end points were baseline to 6 months changes in (i) cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in prespecified regions of interest (hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontal); and (ii) changes in posterior cingulate levels of the neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate as measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological testing for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers and in vivo measures of glutamate in posterior cingulate measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a potential marker of target engagement. Measures of cerebral glucose metabolism, a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression, declined significantly less in several prespecified regions of interest with the most robust effect in posterior cingulate, and effects in precuneus, lateral temporal, right hippocampus and frontal cortex in riluzole-treated participants in comparison to the placebo group. No group effect was found in measures of N-acetylaspartate levels. A positive correlation was observed between cognitive measures and regional cerebral glucose metabolism. A group × visit interaction was observed in glutamate levels in posterior cingulate, potentially suggesting engagement of glutamatergic system by riluzole. In vivo glutamate levels positively correlated with cognitive performance. These findings support our main primary hypothesis that cerebral glucose metabolism would be better preserved in the riluzole-treated group than in the placebo group and provide a rationale for more powered, longer duration studies of riluzole as a potential intervention for Alzheimer's disease.",Alzheimer’s disease| FDG PET| cerebral brain metabolism| glutamate| riluzole,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

However, there was a tendency for a significant increase in the schizophrenic symptoms of the deanol-treated group relative to the control group. The ineffectiveness of deanol in alleviating tardive dyskinesia is consistent with its inability to enhance brain acetylcholine synthesis. The worsening of the schizophrenic symptoms may possibly result from an interference by deanol with central cholinergic function.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1489,34851866,Cognitive and behavioral neurology : official journal of the Society for Behavioral and Cognitive Neurology,Impact of Donepezil and Memantine on Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Alzheimer Disease: Six-month Open-label Study,"BACKGROUND: Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are common in individuals with Alzheimer disease (AD). Donepezil and memantine are both widely used for the treatment of moderate AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of donepezil and memantine in relieving BPSD in individuals with moderate AD. METHOD: We conducted a prospective, randomized, 6-month clinical trial involving 85 individuals with moderate AD divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 42) was treated with donepezil; group 2 (n = 43) was treated with memantine. We used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess the prevalence and severity of BPSD at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with donepezil or memantine. RESULTS: The two groups' baseline characteristics, including age, sex, mean length of education, and disease duration, were comparable, as were their baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The NPI Total score improved from baseline to month 6 in both groups (P < 0.0001). Analyses of the NPI subdomains revealed that both donepezil treatment and memantine treatment produced statistically significant improvement in all of the NPI domains except euphoria and apathy, for which no improvement was observed after memantine treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with mostly mild and transient adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Specific drugs for AD, including donepezil and memantine, may be effective in treating BPSD in individuals with moderate AD, with a favorable safety profile.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1490,17522560,Journal of psychiatric practice,Efficacy and safety of oral aripiprazole compared with haloperidol in patients transitioning from acute treatment with intramuscular formulations,"OBJECTIVE: To report efficacy and safety of transitioning patients receiving intramuscular (IM) formulations of aripiprazole or haloperidol to their respective oral formulations. METHODS: 448 agitated patients with schizophrenia (73%) or schizoaffective disorder (27%) were randomized to receive aripiprazole IM 9.75 mg, haloperidol IM 6.5 mg, or placebo IM within 24 hours. Patients treated with aripiprazole IM or haloperidol IM who completed this 24-hour IM phase were transitioned to the respective blinded oral formulations for 4 days (aripiprazole 10-15 mg/day, n = 153; haloperidol 7.5-10 mg/day, n = 151). Patients treated with placebo IM were transitioned to oral aripiprazole (analysis not included). The primary efficacy measure was mean change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PEC) score from baseline of oral phase (last value from 24-hour IM phase) to endpoint (study day 5, last observation carried forward). RESULTS: During the oral phase, aripiprazole 15 mg and haloperidol 10 mg were both effective in maintaining responses achieved on all efficacy measures during the 24-hour IM phase. Mean improvements in PEC scores from study day 1 to 5 were -1.37 for aripiprazole and -1.40 for haloperidol (p = NS for aripiprazole versus haloperidol). Oral aripiprazole was well tolerated. Extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse events were lower for aripiprazole (1.3%) than haloperidol (8.0%). Nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently in patients receiving aripiprazole (3.9% and 2.6%, respectively) than in those receiving haloperidol (0.7% and 1.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with aripiprazole IM or haloperidol IM demonstrated similar effective and safe transition to their respective oral formulations. Initial benefits of reduced agitation and improved clinical status during the IM phase of the study were maintained throughout the oral phase of the study with good tolerability.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1491,34059401,The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry,Low Dose Lithium Treatment of Behavioral Complications in Alzheimer's Disease: Lit-AD Randomized Clinical Trial,"BACKGROUND: A case series suggested efficacy for lithium to treat agitation in dementia, but no placebo-controlled trials have been conducted. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate low-dose lithium treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In a four-site trial, patients with AD and agitation/aggression score ≥4 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were randomized, double-blind, to lithium carbonate 150-600 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy outcome was change in NPI agitation/aggression; secondary efficacy outcome was treatment response (30% reduction in NPI score for agitation/aggression plus psychosis and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score of much or very much improved). Safety profile of lithium was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 77 patients (75.3%) completed the trial. In linear mixed effects model analyses, lithium was not significantly superior to placebo for agitation/aggression. Proportion of responders was 31.6% on lithium and 17.9% on placebo (χ(2)=1.26, p = 0.26). Moderate or marked improvement (CGI) was greater on lithium (10/38=36.8%) than placebo (0/39=0%, Fisher's exact test p <0.001). In exploratory analyses, improvement on lithium was greater than placebo on NPI delusions and irritability/lability (p's<0.05). Lithium showed greater reduction than placebo in patients with high Young Mania Rating Scale scores (β=5.06; 95%CI,1.18 to 8.94, p = 0.01). Oral dose and serum levels demonstrated similar associations with efficacy outcomes. Lithium did not differ significantly from placebo on safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose lithium was not efficacious in treating agitation but was associated with global clinical improvement and excellent safety. A larger trial may be warranted of likely lithium-responsive behavioral symptoms that overlap with mania.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1492,16728716,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,Intervention at the level of the neuroendocrine-immune axis and postoperative pneumonia rate in long-term alcoholics.,"Postoperative pneumonia is three to four times more frequent in patients with alcohol use disorders followed by prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Long-term alcohol use leads to an altered perioperative hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and immunity.	The aim of this study was to evaluate HPA intervention with low-dose ethanol, morphine, or ketoconazole on the neuroendocrine-immune axis and development of postoperative pneumonia in long-term alcoholic patients.	In this randomized, double-blind controlled study, 122 consecutive patients undergoing elective surgery for aerodigestive tract cancer were included. Long-term alcohol use was defined as consuming at least 60 g of ethanol daily and fulfilling the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV criteria for either alcohol abuse or dependence. Nonalcoholic patients were included but only as a descriptive control. Perioperative intervention with low-dose ethanol (0.5 g/kg body weight per day), morphine (15 mug/kg body weight per hour), ketoconazole (200 mg four times daily), and placebo was started on the morning before surgery and continued for 3 d after surgery. Blood samples to analyze the neuroendocrine-immune axis were obtained on the morning before intervention and on Days 1, 3, and 7 after surgery.	In long-term alcoholic patients, all interventions decreased postoperative hypercortisolism and prevented impairment of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte type 1:type 2 ratio. All interventions decreased the pneumonia rate from 39% to a median of 5.7% and shortened intensive care unit stay by 9 d (median) compared with the placebo-treated long-term alcoholic patients.	Intervention at the level of the HPA axis altered the immune response to surgical stress. This resulted in decreased postoperative pneumonia rates and shortened intensive care unit stay in long-term alcoholic patients.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: EMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. SETTING: These studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 1638 (EMERGE) and 1647 (ENGAGE) patients (aged 50-85 years, confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia, of which 1812 (55.2%) completed the study. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (10 mg/kg target dose), or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; and biomarker endpoints. RESULTS: EMERGE and ENGAGE were halted based on futility analysis of data pooled from the first approximately 50% of enrolled patients; subsequent efficacy analyses included data from a larger data set collected up to futility declaration and followed prespecified statistical analyses. The primary endpoint was met in EMERGE (difference of -0.39 for high-dose aducanumab vs placebo [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P=.012; 22% decrease]) but not in ENGAGE (difference of 0.03, [95% CI, -0.26 to 0.33; P=.833; 2% increase]). Results of biomarker substudies confirmed target engagement and dose-dependent reduction in markers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The most common adverse event was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema. CONCLUSIONS: Data from EMERGE demonstrated a statistically significant change across all four primary and secondary clinical endpoints. ENGAGE did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints.

1495,36114949,Advances in therapy,Safety Findings in Lasmiditan as a Novel Acute Treatment of Migraine in Chinese Patients: A Post Hoc Analysis of the Randomized Controlled Phase 3 CENTURION Trial.,"Lasmiditan is the first 5-HT1F receptor agonist with potential to address the huge unmet medical needs for the treatment of migraine in China. The CENTURION study was the first phase 3 study of lasmiditan in Caucasian and Chinese patients with migraine. This post hoc analysis further demonstrates the safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population and was urgently needed.	Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to lasmiditan 200 mg lasmiditan 100 mg, or a control group. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), their severity, and incidence by treated attacks for frequently reported TEAEs (≥ 5%) were evaluated. The duration, onset, and relationship of efficacy with very common TEAEs (≥ 10%) was analyzed.	A total of 281 Chinese patients were included in this post hoc analysis. No deaths and no study drug-related treatment emergent serious adverse events (TESAEs) were reported. The incidence of at least one TEAE was higher in patients receiving lasmiditan 200 mg (73.9%) and 100 mg (66.3%) versus placebo (26.6%). TEAEs were generally mild or moderate in severity, and the incidence of frequently reported TEAEs was generally highest during the first attack. Very common TEAEs with lasmiditan included dizziness, asthenia, somnolence, muscular weakness, fatigue, and nausea. The duration of dizziness was longest during the first attack. There were no cardio-cerebrovascular ischemic events and serotonin syndrome. The presence of very common TEAEs (except nausea), and severe dizziness, did not appear to have a negative influence on the efficacy.	In the Chinese population of the CENTURION study, most of the TEAEs were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort, while the overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the CENTURION primary cohort. No new safety concerns were observed in the Chinese population.	NCT03670810.	Although there is significant unmet medical need among patients with migraine, there has been no novel compound for treatment of migraine over past two decades in China. These unmet medical needs persist because the current available medications for the acute treatment of migraine are reported to have safety and tolerability issues. Lasmiditan is a new class of acute migraine medication (5-HT receptor agonist with high selectivity for the 5-HT1F receptor) with a proven efficacy and safety in phase 2 and 3 studies. Owing to some differences in clinical practice between China and western countries, there is need to get additional evidence on safety of lasmiditan in the Chinese population to support its usage in clinical practice.This post hoc analysis was conducted to present the detailed safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population using data from the CENTURION study. Approximately half of the analyzed population was not covered in the published primary cohort.The results show that in the Chinese population of the study, most of the treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were neurologic, of mild or moderate severity, and self-limiting. The distribution of frequently reported TEAEs at the first attack differed from the primary cohort with no new safety concerns observed in the Chinese population. The overall safety profile of lasmiditan in the Chinese population was generally consistent with the primary cohort. The results provide additional evidence and emphasize that lasmiditan may be considered as a useful acute treatment option with acceptable safety profile for patients with migraine in China.",CENTURION study| Chinese population| Lasmiditan| Migraine| Safety,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Neurology,"Doxycycline in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal, untreatable prion encephalopathy. Previous studies showed that doxycycline is effective in in-vitro and in-vivo models of disease, and patients with CJD who received compassionate treatment with doxycycline showed increased survival time compared with historical series. We therefore did a randomised, double-blind study of doxycycline versus placebo in CJD. METHODS: We recruited patients older than 18 years old who had a diagnosis of definite or probable sporadic CJD or genetic forms of the disease via Italian reference centres and the French national referral system. Patients were randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to receive oral doxycycline (100 mg daily) or placebo under double-blind conditions from the day of randomisation to death. Centralised randomisation was done independently of enrolment or evaluation of patients using a minimisation method in Italy and a simple randomisation in France. Participants, caregivers, and clinicians were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy variable was the survival time from randomisation. Interim analyses were planned to detect a significant effect of treatment as early as possible. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2006-001858-27 for the Italian study and 2007-005553-34 for the French study. FINDINGS: From April 12, 2007, to Aug 19, 2010, in Italy, and from Jan 30, 2009, to Jan 10, 2012, in France, 121 patients with CJD were enrolled in the study, 62 of whom were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 59 to the placebo group. The first interim analysis showed absence of superiority of doxycycline compared with placebo, and the trial was stopped for futility. Efficacy analyses did not show significant differences between patients treated with doxycycline and placebo with regard to survival times (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.7, p=0.50). Serious adverse events were judged not to be related to treatment, whereas a relation was deemed probable or possible for five non-serious adverse events that occurred in each treatment group. INTERPRETATION: Doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg per day was well tolerated but did not significantly affect the course of CJD, at variance with the results of previous observational studies. Our experience could be useful in the design of large multinational controlled trials of potential anti-prion molecules in this rare disease.

This report provides detailed results on the metabolic effects of pioglitazone and the trial's prespecified secondary aim of diabetes prevention.	A total of 3,876 patients with recent ischemic stroke or TIA, no history of diabetes, fasting plasma glucose (FPG) <126 mg/dL, and insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score >3.0 were randomly assigned to pioglitazone or placebo. Surveillance for diabetes onset during the trial was accomplished by periodic interviews and annual FPG testing.	At baseline, the mean FPG, HbA1c, insulin, and HOMA-IR were 98.2 mg/dL (5.46 mmol/L), 5.8% (40 mmol/mol), 22.4 μIU/mL, and 5.4, respectively. After 1 year, mean HOMA-IR and FPG decreased to 4.1 and 95.1 mg/dL (5.28 mmol/L) in the pioglitazone group and rose to 5.7 and 99.7 mg/dL (5.54 mmol/L), in the placebo group (all P < 0.0001). Over a median follow-up of 4.8 years, diabetes developed in 73 (3.8%) participants assigned to pioglitazone compared with 149 (7.7%) assigned to placebo (hazard ratio [HR] 0.48 [95% CI 0.33-0.69]; P < 0.0001). This effect was predominately driven by those with initial impaired fasting glucose (FPG >100 mg/dL [5.6 mmol/L]; HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.30-0.57]) or elevated HbA1c (>5.7% [39 mmol/mol]; HR 0.46 [0.34-0.62]).	Among patients with insulin resistance but without diabetes who had had a recent ischemic stroke or TIA, pioglitazone decreased the risk of diabetes while also reducing the risk of subsequent ischemic events.

A total of 196 patients entered the study, 147 patients completed treatment in adherence with the protocol. Primary outcome measures were the cognitive score of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the subscale Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER-IADL) and the Clinical Global Impressions of Change (CGI-C). Safety assessments included adverse events, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory parameters. The primary efficacy results based on a multi-level responder analysis including ADAS-Cog, NOSGER-IADL and CGI-C failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of cyclandelate in comparison to placebo. The direction of changes favored cyclandelate in each of the variables, but the differences to placebo were small and varied considerably between patients and centers. Retrospective exploratory analyses suggested that efficacy of cyclandelate might be dependent on the severity of the disease. The treatment effects in favor of cyclandelate were statistically significant in the subgroup of moderately impaired patients (MMSE at baseline <18) for ADAS-Cog (delta = -4.0 points, p = 0.015) and CGI-C (delta = -0.4 points, p = 0.043) but not for NOSGER-IADL (delta = -1.6 points, p = 0.059). When patients were stepwise selected for the severity of the disease according to ADAS-Cog at baseline (>15, >20, >25 points), statistical significance was reached for ADAS-Cog and NOSGER-IADL beginning with the step ADAS-Cog >20 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -3.9 points, p = 0.044; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.0, p = 0.023. The treatment differences increased further with the step ADAS-Cog >25 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -7.0 points, p = 0.008; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.7, p = 0.003.

In a placebo-controlled 2X2 design, 7-14 year-olds (N = 95) in parallel pilot trials (depression N = 72; bipolar N = 23) were randomly assigned to 12 weeks of Ω3 supplementation (1.4 g eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA], 0.2 g docosahexaenoic acid [DHA], and 0.27 g other Ω3 per day); psychoeducational psychotherapy (PEP); their combination; or placebo (mainly oleic and linoleic acid) alone. Blood was drawn at baseline (N = 90) and endpoint (n = 65). Fatty acid levels were expressed as percent of total plasma fatty acids. Correlational and moderator/mediator analyses were done with SPSS Statistics 23.	At baseline: (1) DHA correlated negatively with alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) (r = -0.23, p = 0.029); (2) Arachidonic acid (AA, Ω6) correlated negatively with global functioning (r = -0.24, p = 0.022); (3) Total Ω3 correlated negatively with age (r = -0.22, p = 0.036) and diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.31, p = 0.006). Moderation: Baseline ALA moderated response to Ω3 supplementation: ALA levels above the sample mean (lower DHA) predicted significantly better placebo-controlled response (p = 0.04). Supplementation effects: Compared to placebo, 2 g Ω3 per day increased EPA blood levels sevenfold and DHA levels by half (both p < 0.001). Body weight correlated inversely with increased EPA (r = -0.52, p = 0.004) and DHA (r = -0.54, p = 0.003) and positively with clinical mood response. Mediation: EPA increase baseline-to-endpoint mediated placebo-controlled global function and depression improvement: the greater the EPA increase, the less the placebo-controlled Ω3 improvement.	Ω3 supplementation at 2 g/day increases blood levels substantially, more so in smaller children.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of depression in AD. METHODS: In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with open-label, 12-week extension, AD subjects over 50 years of age, with depression defined by Olin's provisional diagnostic criteria, were enrolled. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and other measures of depression and cognition were repeated. RESULTS: 91 subjects were screened, and 84 were randomized into either the study group or placebo group (n = 42 for both groups). Twenty-four subjects (29%) were unable to finish the study, yielding a per protocol population of 60 subjects (study group: n = 27; placebo group: n = 33). At week 12, differences in measures of depression and cognition between the two groups were not statistically significant. However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'definite major depression' (baseline CSDD score ≥18) is needed. The number of treatment-related adverse-events (AE) did not differ between groups (p = 0.83) and no serious treatment-related AE were observed. CONCLUSION: The use of escitalopram was well tolerated in depressive dementia patients.

Data were pooled from 9 short-term, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies in adults with MDD randomly assigned to desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, 100 mg/d, or placebo. A mixed-effects model for repeated-measures analysis of change from baseline score was used to determine the time point at which desvenlafaxine treatment groups separated from placebo on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression and psychosocial outcomes. The association between early improvement and week 8 outcomes was examined using logistic regression analyses. Time to remission for patients with early improvement versus without early improvement was assessed using Kaplan-Meier techniques. Comparisons between groups were performed with log-rank tests.	In the intent-to-treat population (N = 4279 patients: desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d, n = 1714; desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d, n = 870; placebo, n = 1695), a statistically significant improvement on the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression was observed with desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d at week 1 (P = 0.0129) and with desvenlafaxine 100 mg/d at week 2 (P = 0.0002) versus placebo. Early improvement was a significant predictor of later remission. Treatment assignment, baseline depression scale scores, and race were significantly associated with probability of early improvement. On several measures of depressive symptoms and function, desvenlafaxine 50 mg/d and 100 mg/d separated from placebo as early as week 1 and no later than week 4 in patients with MDD.	These findings suggest that clinicians may be able to use depression rating scale scores early in treatment as a guide to inform treatment optimization.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1505,2044398,Current medical research and opinion,Efficacy of naftidrofuryl in patients with moderate senile dementia,"In a controlled double-blind study, 78 patients with moderate senile dementia were randomly assigned to 3-months' treatment with 200 mg naftidrofuryl twice daily in slow-release form or with placebo. The patients were selected on the basis of the EACG (Echelle d'Appréciation Clinique en Gériatrie), which was also used as main criterion for confirmatory analysis of the efficacy of naftidrofuryl. A further main criterion was the SGRS (Stockton Geriatric Rating Scale). Secondary criteria examined were visual memory as tested in the Benton test, verbal memory as tested in the Rey test and numerical memory as tested in the digit-span test. The patients' concentration was tested in the Zazzo test. The tests were performed before the patients were admitted to the study and after 1 and 3-months' treatment. Confirmatory analysis of the primary criteria showed a significant treatment difference in favour of naftidrofuryl in the form of improvement in the global symptoms of senile dementia both in the EACG and in the SGRS, the scores in the naftidrofuryl group improving by 15% compared with only 5% in the placebo group. This was paralleled by a significant improvement in visual and verbal memory in the naftidrofuryl group in comparison with placebo. The naftidrofuryl patients also showed a greater improvement in concentration than the placebo group. One patient in the naftidrofuryl group suffered briefly from gastro-intestinal symptoms.

There were three phases: 4 weeks baseline, 18 weeks titration to 200-400 mg topiramate/day (adults) or 5-9 mg/kg/day (children), 12 weeks maintenance. Recruitment was low (88/120); analyses were underpowered. Seizure frequency varied enormously (median 17.7, maximum 1706.2). There was no significant difference in reduction in mean total seizure frequency or number of responders between the groups. Topiramate reduced seizure frequency by >30% from baseline (placebo 1%); post hoc analyses showed a trend toward significance (R ratio, P=0.052). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to mean seizure severity or other outcome measures. Topiramate was generally well tolerated; body weight (P=0.015) and systolic blood pressure (P=0.043) were reduced.

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research center at a major urban medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were a referred and volunteer sample of 52 participants with TBI, a diagnosis of major depression disorder (MDD), and a score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) of 18 or greater. The majority of the sample was male (58%), had less than 14 years of education (73%), had incomes below $20,000 (82%), and were from minority backgrounds (75%). Approximately one third of the sample had mild brain injuries, and two thirds had moderate to severe brain injuries. The mean age was 47+/-11, and the mean time since injury was 17+/-14 years. One participant withdrew from the study because of side effects. INTERVENTION: Daily oral sertraline in doses starting at 25mg and increasing to therapeutic levels (up to 200mg) or placebo for 10 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The HAM-D, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Life-3 quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found at baseline between drug and placebo groups on baseline measures of depression (24.8+/-7.3 vs 27.7+/-7.0), anxiety (16.4+/-12.3 vs 24.0+/-14.9), or QOL (2.96+/-1.0 vs 2.9+/-0.9). The income level of those receiving placebo was significantly lower than those participants receiving medication. Analyses of covariance revealed significant changes from preintervention to posttreatment for all 3 outcome measures (P<.001) but no group effects. Random-effects modeling did not find any significant difference in patterns of scores of the outcome measures between the placebo and medication groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups showed improvements in mood, anxiety, and QOL, with 59% of the experimental group and 32% of the placebo group responding to the treatment, defined as a reduction of a person's HAM-D score by 50%.",,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
1509,28124585,Current Alzheimer research,"Poor Safety and Tolerability Hamper Reaching a Potentially Therapeutic Dose in the Use of Thalidomide for Alzheimer's Disease: Results from a Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial","INTRODUCTION: To date there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD). After amyloid beta immunotherapies have failed to meet primary endpoints of slowing cognitive decline in AD subjects, the inhibition of the beta-secretase BACE1 appears as a promising therapeutic approach. Pre-clinical data obtained in APP23 mice suggested that the anti-cancer drug thalidomide decreases brainBACE1 and Aβ levels. This prompted us to develop an NIH-supported Phase IIa clinical trial to test the potential of thalidomide for AD. We hypothesized that thalidomide can decrease or stabilize brain amyloid deposits, which would result in slower cognitive decline in drug- versus placebo-treated subjects. METHODS: This was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with escalating dose regimen of thalidomide with a target dose of 400mg daily in patients with mild to moderate AD. The primary outcome measures were tolerability and cognitive performance assessed by a battery of tests. RESULTS: A total of 185 subjects have been pre-screened, out of which25 were randomized. Mean age of the sample at baseline was 73.64 (±7.20) years; mean education was 14.24 (±2.3) years; mean MMSE score was 21.00 (±5.32); and mean GDS score was 2.76 (±2.28).Among the 25 participants, 14 (56%) terminated early due to adverse events, dramatically decreasing the power of the study. In addition, those who completed the study (44%) never reached the estimated therapeutic dose of 400 mg/day thalidomide because of reported adverse events. The cognitive data showed no difference between the treated and placebo groups at the end of the trial. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates AD patients have poor tolerability for thalidomide, and are unable to reach a therapeutic dose felt to be sufficient to have effects on BACE1. Because of poor tolerability, this study failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on cognition.",Adverse events| Alzheimer's Disease| clinical trial| cognitive tests| thalidomide| tolerability.,Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The authors hypothesized that divalproex sodium (VPA) would improve posttraumatic irritability and result in lessened alcohol use. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial recruited participants with an index TBI occurring 1 or more years prior to enrollment, a history of alcohol use disorder, and posttraumatic irritability corroborated by a knowledgeable informant. An 8-item subset of the Agitated Behavior Scale served as the primary outcome measure of VPA efficacy. Doses of VPA were titrated to standard serum concentrations of 50 µg/ml to 100 µg/ml. RESULTS: Forty-eight persons completed this clinical trial (VPA, N=22; placebo, N=26). At baseline, participants rated their posttraumatic irritability as less severe than did their informants (p<0.05). During the trial, informants reported significant and sustained reduction of posttraumatic irritability (p=0.03) in the study participants. Biweekly averages during drug exposure confirmed this (p<0.03, Cohen's d=0.44). Treatment efficacy was not related to measures of anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, sedation, or veteran versus nonveteran status. Alcohol use did not change as a result of treatment. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an effect of VPA on posttraumatic irritability, and VPA was well tolerated.

This was a randomized, parallel arms, placebo-contolled trial. Children with hypertonic CP aged 2 to 15 years awaiting bony hip surgery at a tertiary hospital were randomized to receive either BoNT-A or placebo injections into the muscles of the hip on a single occasion immediately before surgery. The primary outcome was the paediatric pain profile (PPP), which was assessed at baseline and weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment allocation was by minimization. Participants, clinicians, and outcome assessors were masked to group assignment.	Twenty-seven participants (17 males, 10 females; mean 8y 8mo [SD 3y 9mo], range 3y 4mo-15y 10mo) were allocated to BoNT-A and 27 participants (14 males, 13 females; mean 8y 11mo [SD 3y 5mo], range 4y 1mo-15y 2mo) to placebo. Mean (SD) PPP at 6 weeks for the BoNT-A group (n=24 followed up) was 10.96 (7.22) and for the placebo group (n=26) was 10.04 (8.54) (p=0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] -4.82, 3.18). There were 16 serious adverse events in total during 6 months of follow-up (n=6 in BoNT-A group).	Use of BoNT-A immediately before bony hip surgery for reducing postoperative pain for children with CP was not supported.	Botulinum neurotoxin A (BoNT-A) does not reduce postoperative pain following bony hip surgery. BoNT-A also does not affect postoperative quality of life.

METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials involving patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease--one involving 1121 carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and the other involving 1331 noncarriers. Bapineuzumab or placebo, with doses varying by study, was administered by intravenous infusion every 13 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary outcome measures were scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11, with scores ranging from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicating greater impairment) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD, with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating less impairment). A total of 1090 carriers and 1114 noncarriers were included in the efficacy analysis. Secondary outcome measures included findings on positron-emission tomographic amyloid imaging with the use of Pittsburgh compound B (PIB-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) concentrations. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes. At week 78, the between-group differences in the change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 and DAD scores (bapineuzumab group minus placebo group) were -0.2 (P=0.80) and -1.2 (P=0.34), respectively, in the carrier study; the corresponding differences in the noncarrier study were -0.3 (P=0.64) and 2.8 (P=0.07) with the 0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose of bapineuzumab and 0.4 (P=0.62) and 0.9 (P=0.55) with the 1.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. The major safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema among patients receiving bapineuzumab, which increased with bapineuzumab dose and APOE ε4 allele number and which led to discontinuation of the 2.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. Between-group differences were observed with respect to PIB-PET and cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau concentrations in APOE ε4 allele carriers but not in noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in APOE ε4 carriers.

1513,22315948,BMC neurology,Aspirin for the prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly: rationale and design of a neuro-vascular imaging study (ENVIS-ion),"BACKGROUND: This paper describes the rationale and design of the ENVIS-ion Study, which aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin reduces the development of white matter hyper-intense (WMH) lesions and silent brain infarction (SBI). Additional aims include determining whether a) changes in retinal vascular imaging (RVI) parameters parallel changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); b) changes in RVI parameters are observed with aspirin therapy; c) baseline cognitive function correlates with MRI and RVI parameters; d) changes in cognitive function correlate with changes in brain MRI and RVI and e) whether factors such as age, gender or blood pressure influence the above associations. METHODS/DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of three years duration set in two Australian academic medical centre outpatient clinics. This study will enrol 600 adults aged 70 years and over with normal cognitive function and without overt cardiovascular disease. Subjects will undergo cognitive testing, brain MRI and RVI at baseline and after 3 years of study treatment. All subjects will be recruited from a 19,000-patient clinical outcome trial conducted in Australia and the United States that will evaluate the effects of aspirin in maintaining disability-free longevity over 5 years. The intervention will be aspirin 100 mg daily versus matching placebo, randomized on a 1:1 basis. DISCUSSION: This study will improve understanding of the mechanisms at the level of brain and vascular structure that underlie the effects of aspirin on cognitive function. Given the limited access and high cost of MRI, RVI may prove useful as a tool for the identification of individuals at high risk for the development of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.

1514,37550718,Trials,"Can dexamethasone improve postoperative sleep and postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy? Protocol for a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled study.","Perioperative sleep disorders (PSD) are an independent risk factor for postoperative delirium (POD), which is a common complication after surgery. Elderly patients who undergo robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP) often experience perioperative sleep disorders (PSD). Dexamethasone, a medication that works by inhibiting the hypothalamic-pituitary-suprarenal cortical axis, can reduce the negative effects of surgical stress. The objective of this study was to determine whether intravenous administration of dexamethasone at the time of anesthesia induction could improve postoperative sleep quality in elderly patients, thereby indirectly reducing the risk of postoperative cognitive impairment and accelerating postoperative rehabilitation.	This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that was conducted at a single center. A sample size of 116 patients was determined through calculation, and these patients were randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone group (group D, n = 58) or the blank control group (group C, n = 58). On the day of surgery, the anesthesia nurse prepared either diluted dexamethasone or saline in advance, according to the patient's assigned group. The blinded anesthesiologist administered the medication during induction, and a dedicated person followed up with the patient for three consecutive postoperative days. All other aspects of care were managed equally between the two groups. The primary outcome measure was sleep quality, while secondary outcome measures included postoperative sleep time, postoperative delirium (POD), pain scores, and other complications. Relevant test measures were recorded for analysis.	This study aims to investigate the impact of intravenous dexamethasone on sleep quality and duration of patients undergoing robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). If the findings of this study protocol are affirmative, it could enhance the sleep quality of elderly patients after surgery, thereby minimizing the risk of postoperative delirium (POD), and providing substantial evidence for the perioperative enhanced recovery management of elderly patients.

To test whether cholinesterase inhibitors compensate for diminished cholinergic activity, we conducted a 30-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of galantamine in patients with tardive dyskinesia. METHOD: Patients with tardive dyskinesia were recruited between June 2001 and June 2004. After a 2-week baseline period, 35 male schizophrenia patients, on stable doses of antipsychotics, were randomly assigned to receive galantamine (8-24 mg) or placebo for two 12-week phases separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients were evaluated every 2 weeks for changes in extrapyramidal symptoms and before and after each treatment for effects on psychiatric symptoms and cognition. RESULTS: Galantamine reduced mean total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores more than placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = .08). However, patients initially randomly assigned to galantamine showed a reversal of AIMS scores after switching to placebo. Simpson-Angus Scale ratings of parkinsonism were significantly higher with galantamine than placebo (p = .0005) and correlated with age. There were no significant differences between groups in akathisia, cognition, or psychiatric symptoms. More patients dropped out while receiving galantamine, but this outcome did not significantly influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, reductions in tardive dyskinesia associated with galantamine were not statistically significant compared with placebo in this trial. However, galantamine was associated with a modest rebound in dyskinesia scores after discontinuation and clinically minor but statistically higher ratings of parkinsonism. These findings support the need for further investigations of cholinergic mechanisms underlying tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal effects of cholinesterase inhibitors when used in combination with antipsychotics in susceptible patients.

Conventional therapies are limited due to the insufficient benefits and side effects, and fire needling therapy is considered an alternative for post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a study protocol for a pilot randomised, two-arm, single-centre, clinical trial at Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University. The trial started in March 2023 and is expected to end in December 2024. A total of 60 patients (aged 40-75 years, male or female) with post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb will be randomly assigned to treatment group (fire needling therapy, 5 sessions per week for 2 weeks) or control group (manual acupuncture, 5 sessions per week for 2 weeks) in a 1:1 ratio using block randomisation and opaque envelopes. Fire needling therapy or manual acupuncture will be performed in ten acupoints. Participants will complete the trial by visiting the research centre at Week 14 for a follow-up assessment. The primary outcome is the response rate. Secondary outcomes include FMA, Barthel Scale/Index (BI), pain threshold (PPT), and muscle elasticity modulus (using shear wave elastography [SWE]). A chi-squared test will be used for response rate. A mixed-effects linear model and a mixed-effects model will be used for FMA, BI, PPT, and SWE, respectively. DISCUSSION: This is the first standardised protocol to compare the effectiveness of fire needling therapy and manual acupuncture. We will use a rigorous methodology to minimise bias and set up supervising committees to ensure the quality of our study, thus providing trustworthy evidence for better understanding of fire needling therapy in treating post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb.",fire needling therapy| manual acupuncture| post-stroke complex regional pain syndrome| upper limb,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Causes for exclusion will be publications that studied patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1; articles that focused on the treatment and complications of diabetes mellitus type 2; publications that have studied other clinical or psychiatric conditions (for instance, seizure disorder or history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms or dementia). CONCLUSION: The results of this study will form the basis for a better understanding of the association between obesity and depression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, and will allow development of prediction tools and better interventions. It is evident that several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes among population. Currently, evidence for the deleterious effects of diabetes mellitus type 2 are based on cross-sectional or other observational designs. Therefore, this study will have important implications for future research and public health guidance.",Diabetes Mellitus type 2; obesity; body mass index; depression.,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
1519,34841124,Contemporary clinical trials communications,Pelvic floor physical therapy in the treatment of chronic anal fissure (PAF-study): Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Chronic anal fissure (CAF) is a common cause of severe anorectal pain with a high incidence rate. Currently, a wide range of treatment options are available with recurrence rates varying between 7 and 42%. Pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) is a treatment option for increased pelvic floor muscle tone and dyssynergia which often accompanies CAF. However, literature on this subject is scarce. The Pelvic Floor Anal Fissure (PAF)-study aims to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of PFPT on improvement on pelvic floor muscle tone and function, pain, healing of the fissure, quality of life and complaint reduction in patients with CAF. METHODS: The PAF-study is a single-centre, two armed, randomized controlled trial. Patients with CAF and pelvic floor dysfunction are eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria include abscess, fistula, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, anorectal malignancy, prior rectal radiation, and pregnancy. A total of 140 patients will be randomized for either PFPT or postponed treatment of PFPT.The primary outcome is tone at rest during electromyographic registration of the pelvic floor before and after therapy. Secondary outcomes consist of healing of the fissure, pain ratings, improvement of pelvic floor function, complaint reduction and quality of life. Primary and secondary endpoints are measured at 8 and 20 weeks and at 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is a gap in treatment modalities between conservative management and surgery. This manuscript prescribes the rationale, design, and methodology of a randomized controlled trial investigating PFPT as a treatment option for patients with CAF.",Anal pain| Biofeedback| Chronic anal fissure| Pelvic floor physical therapy,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
1520,26159452,BMJ open,To tweet or not to tweet about schizophrenia systematic reviews (TweetSz): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: The Cochrane Schizophrenia Group (CSzG) has produced and maintained systematic reviews of effects of interventions for schizophrenia and related illness. Each review has a Plain Language Summary (PLS), for those without specialised knowledge, and an abstract, which are freely available from The Cochrane Library (https://summaries.cochrane.org). Increasingly, evidence is being distributed using social media such as Twitter and Weibo (in China) alongside traditional publications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a prospective two-arm, parallel, open randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio, we will allocate 170 published systematic reviews into the intervention group (tweeting arm/Weibo arm) versus the control group (non-tweeting arm). Reviews will be stratified by baseline access activity, defined as high (≥19 views per week, n=14), medium (4.3 to 18.99 views per week, n=72) or low (<4.3 views per week, n=84), based on Google Analytics, which will also be used for evaluating outcomes. The intervention group will have three tweets daily using Hootsuite with a slightly different accompanying text (written by CEA and AB) and a shortened Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to the PLS: a) The review title as it appears in summaries.cochrane.org, b) A pertinent extract from results or discussion sections of the abstract and c) An intriguing question or pithy statement related to the evidence in the abstract. The primary outcome will be: total number of visits to a PLS in 7 days following the tweet. Secondary outcomes will include % new visits, bounce rate, pages per visit, visit duration, page views, unique page views, time on page, entrances, exiting behaviour and country distribution. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study does not involve living participants, and uses information available in the public domain. Participants are published systematic reviews, hence, no ethical approval is required. Dissemination will be via Twitter, Weibo and traditional academic means.

Starting SUD treatment offers the opportunity to also quit smoking. The ACT-ATAC project aims to identify the predictors associated with smoking cessation among persons treated for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder in Barcelona. This manuscript reports its methodology and the experience of carrying it out during the COVID-19 pandemic.	Mixed methods project with three substudies. Substudy 1 (S1) comprises heterogeneous discussion groups among clinicians. S2 has two prospective cohorts composed of smokers under treatment for alcohol and/or cannabis use disorder and the clinicians in charge of these patients. Participating smokers will be followed for 12 months and interviewed about their substance use and the tobacco cessation services received using the Spanish version of the users' Knowledge, Attitudes, and Services (S-KAS) scale. The clinicians will be asked about their self-reported practices in smoking cessation using the Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (S-KAP) scale. S3 comprises heterogeneous discussion groups with smokers. Data will be triangulated using qualitative and quantitative analyses. To facilitate the recruitment process, the researchers have introduced several strategies (design clear protocols, set monthly online meetings, extend the project, provide gift cards, etc.).	The results of S1 were used to develop the questionnaires. S2 required some adjustments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the follow-up interviews being conducted by phone instead of face-to-face, and the recruitment rhythm was lower than expected. Recruitment will last until reaching at least 200-250 users. The fieldwork could not have been possible without the collaboration of the ACT-ATAC team and the introduction of several strategies.

1523,34667009,BMJ open,Study protocol for a randomised controlled clinical trial comparing desflurane-based versus propofol-based anaesthesia on postanaesthesia respiratory depression in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea after major abdominal surgery,"INTRODUCTION: Patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are more sensitive to postanaesthesia respiratory depression. Whether different anaesthetic regimens (intravenous-based or inhalational-based general anaesthesia) affect the postanaesthesia respiratory depression is controversial. Although desflurane has been reported that presents favourable rapid recovery profile in special patients including whom with OSA, the strong clinical evidence of the benefit on postanaesthesia respiratory depression is far from being revealed. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the postanaesthesia respiratory depression in postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) in patients with OSA after major abdominal surgery, followed by desflurane-based anaesthesia compared with propofol-based anaesthesia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eight hundred and fifty-four patients with OSA scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery will be randomly 1:1 assigned to desflurane-based (n=427) or propofol-based anaesthesia (n=427) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme with permuted block size maintained by a centralised randomisation centre. Patients will be assessed before and a consecutive 3 days after their surgery according to the standardised tasks. Demographic data as well as surgical and anaesthesia information will be collected for the duration of the procedure. Incidence of postanaesthesia respiratory depression in PACU as well as anaesthesia recovery, emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, rescue analgesia, duration of PACU and hospital stay, and any other adverse events will be assessed at the given study time point. Investigators performing postoperative follow-up are not involved in both anaesthesia implementation and postoperative care. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study protocol has been approved by the ethics board at Xiang'an Hospital of Xiamen University (XAHLL2019003). The results of this study will be published in a peer-review journal and presented at national conferences as poster or oral presentations.

1524,25710916,BMJ open,'Do Well B.': Design Of WELL Being monitoring systems. A study protocol for the application in autism.,"Individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have difficulties in communication and social interaction resulting from atypical perceptual and cognitive information processing, leading to an accumulation of anxiety. Extreme overloading experienced internally may not be externally visible. Identifying stressful situations at an early stage may avoid socially problematic behaviour from occurring, such as self-injurious behaviour. Activation of the autonomous nervous system (ANS) is involved in the response to anxiety, which can be measured through heart rate variability and skin conductance with the use of portable devices, non-intrusively and pain-free. Thus, developing innovative analysis of signal perception and reaction is necessary, mainly for non-communicative individuals with autism.	The protocol will take place in real life (home and social environments). We aim to associate modifications of the ANS with external events that will be recorded in a synchronous manner through a specific design (spy glasses with video/audio recording). Four phases will be carried out on ASD participants and aged-matched controls: (1) 24-hour baseline pre-experiment (physical activity, sleep), (2) 2 h in a real life situation, (3) 30 min in a quiet environment, interrupted by a few seconds of stressful sound, (4) an interview to record feelings about events triggering anxiety. ASD and control participants will be together for phases 2 and 3, revealing different physiological responses to the same situations, and thus identifying potentially problematic events. The novelty will be to apply time-series analyses (which led to several Nobel Prizes in quantitative finance) on ANS series (heart rate, heart rate variability, skin conductance) and wrist motion.	Ethical approval has been obtained from Ethics Committee of Clermont-Ferrand (South-East I), France (2014-A00611-46). Trial findings will be disseminated via open-access peer-reviewed publications, conferences, clinical networks, public lectures and our websites.

1525,26714784,Trials,Remote ischemic preconditioning in the prevention of ischemic brain damage during intracranial aneurysm treatment (RIPAT): study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.,"The treatment of intracranial aneurysms may be associated with cerebral ischemia. We hypothesize that pre-interventional remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) reduces ischemic cerebral tissue damage in patients undergoing elective intracranial aneurysm treatment.	This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, double-blind explorative trial. Patients with an unruptured intracranial aneurysm admitted to Innsbruck Medical University Hospital for coiling or clipping will be consecutively randomized to either the intervention group (= RIPC by inflating an upper extremity blood-pressure cuff for 3 x 5 min to 200 mmHg) or the control group after induction of anesthesia. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to either the preconditioning group or the sham group using a random allocation sequence and block randomization. The precalculated sample size is n = 24 per group. The primary endpoint is the area-under-the-curve concentration of serum biomarkers (S100B, NSE, GFAP, MMP9, MBP, and cellular microparticles) in the first five days after treatment. Secondary endpoints are the number and volume of new ischemic lesions in magnetic resonance imaging and clinical outcome evaluated with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, the modified Rankin Scale, and neuropsychological tests at six and twelve months. All outcome variables will be determined by observers blinded to group allocation. This study was approved by the local institutional Ethics Committee (UN5164), version 3.0 of the study protocol, dated 20 October 2013.	This study uses the elective treatment of intracranial aneurysms as a paradigmatic situation to explore the neuroprotective effects of RIPC.

1526,31665033,Reproductive health,Evaluating the effectiveness of a combined approach to improve utilization of adolescent sexual reproductive health services in Kenya: a quasi-experimental design study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Access to and utilization of adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) services remains poor. ASRH services in Kenya are primarily offered in health facilities and include counselling, information, and services on family planning, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV and basic life skills. The Ministry of Education also provides age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health information in schools. This paper presents a study protocol that will evaluate the effectiveness of a combined approach toward improving utilization of ASRH services. METHODS: This will be a quasi-experimental study utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. During the formative phase, data will be collected through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators of provision and utilization of ASRH services. A quantitative design will be used to obtain baseline and endline data through household surveys and client exit interviews. Following the formative and baseline household and client exit assessments, an intervention focusing on provision of ASRH service package targeting boys and girls will be implemented for 18 months. The package will include contextualized ASRH services, including counselling and age-appropriate, comprehensive sexual education for behavior change with an aim to increase utilization of ASRH services. An analysis of the primary outcome (utilization of ASRH services) will be undertaken to establish the difference in difference between the control and intervention arm, before the intervention (using the baseline survey data) and after the intervention (using the endline survey data). DISCUSSION: Adolescents have now been included in the World Health Organization's Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016-2030), acknowledging the unique health challenges facing young people and their pivotal role as drivers of change in the post-2015 era. This study will generate evidence on whether a combined school, facility, and community approach works toward improving utilization of ASRH services. The information generated from the study will be beneficial for programming as it will identify underlying reasons for low utilization of ASRH services. Results will help to shape ASRH programs and reduce teenage pregnancy within Kenya and other similar low middle-income countries.

1527,34876196,Trials,"Investigator-Driven Randomised Controlled Trial of Cefiderocol versus Standard Therapy for Healthcare-Associated and Hospital-Acquired Gram-negative Bloodstream Infection: Study protocol (the GAME CHANGER trial): study protocol for an open-label, randomised controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Increasing rates of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative organisms due to the presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), hyperproduction of AmpC enzymes, carbapenemases and other mechanisms of resistance are identified in common hospital- and healthcare-associated pathogens including Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic with a catechol moiety on the 3-position side chain. Cefiderocol has been shown to be potent in vitro against a broad range of Gram-negative organisms, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Recent clinical data has shown cefiderocol to be effective in the setting of complicated urinary tract infections and nosocomial pneumonia, but it has not yet been studied as treatment of bloodstream infection. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing cefiderocol and standard of care antibiotics. Eligible participants will be adult inpatients who are diagnosed with a bloodstream infection with a Gram-negative organism on the basis of a positive blood culture result where the acquisition meets the definition for healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired. It will compare cefiderocol with the current standard of care (SOC) antibiotic regimen according to the patient's treating clinician. Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1 to cefiderocol or SOC and receive 5-14 days of antibiotic therapy. Trial recruitment will occur in at least 20 sites in ten countries (Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and Greece). The sample size has been derived from an estimated 14 day, all-cause mortality rate of 10% in the control group, and a non-inferiority margin of 10% difference in the two groups. A minimum of 284 patients are required in total to achieve 80% power with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: With increasing antimicrobial resistance, there is a need for the development of new antibiotics with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens such as cefiderocol. By selecting a population at risk for multi-drug-resistant pathogens and commencing study treatment early in the clinical illness (within 48 h of index blood culture) the trial hopes to provide guidance to clinicians of the efficacy of this novel agent.

1528,27450411,BMC pulmonary medicine,"Study protocol, rationale and recruitment in a European multi-centre randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy and safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months in primary ciliary dyskinesia","BACKGROUND: Clinical management of primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) respiratory disease is currently based on improving mucociliary clearance and controlling respiratory infections, through the administration of antibiotics. Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. METHODS: The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. DISCUSSION: We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

1530,18405390,Trials,A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of nasal calcitonin on bone microarchitecture measured by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography in postmenopausal women - study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Bone microarchitecture is a significant determinant of bone strength. So far, the assessment of bone microarchitecture has required bone biopsies, limiting its utilization in clinical practice to one single skeletal site. With the advance of high-resolution imaging techniques, non-invasive in vivo measurement of bone microarchitecture has recently become possible. This provides an opportunity to efficiently assess the effects of anti-osteoporotic therapies on bone microarchitecture. We therefore designed a protocol to investigate the effects of nasal salmon calcitonin, an inhibitor of osteoclast activity, on bone microarchitecture in postmenopausal women, comparing weight bearing and non-weight bearing skeletal sites. METHODS: One hundred postmenopausal women will be included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial comparing the effect of nasal salmon calcitonin (200 UI/day) to placebo over two years. Bone microarchitecture at the distal radius and distal tibia will be determined yearly by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (p-QCT) with a voxel size of 82 mum and an irradiation of less than 5 muSv. Serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation will be measured every 6 months. Safety and compliance will be assessed. Primary endpoint is the change in bone microarchitecture; secondary endpoint is the change in markers of bone turnover. HYPOTHESIS: The present study should provide new information on the mode of action of nasal calcitonin. We hypothezise that - compared to placebo - calcitonin impacts on microstructural parameters, with a possible difference between weight bearing and non-weight bearing bones.

1531,37709314,BMJ open,Neoadjuvant chemoradiation therapy combined with immunotherapy for microsatellite stable ultra-low rectal cancer (CHOICE II): study protocol of a multicentre prospective randomised clinical trial,"INTRODUCTION: Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (nCRT) could bring tumour shrinking and downstaging and increase the probability of organ preservation for patients with low rectal cancer. But for ultra-low rectal cancer, there is little possibility for organ preservation. Immunotherapy has been shown to have significant survival benefits in microsatellite instability-high patients but poor response in microsatellite stable (MSS) patients. Studies have demonstrated that radiotherapy and immunotherapy have synergistic effects in cancer treatment. There is no existing evidence about the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy combined with nCRT for patients with MSS ultra-low rectal cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This trial is an open-labelled multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial (NCT05215379) with two parallel groups and allocation ratio 1:1 (nCRT+immunotherapy vs nCRT group). Eligible participants will be aged 18-75 years, with a desire for anus preservation, confirmed cT(1-3a)N(0-1)M(0) rectal adenocarcinoma, confirmed MSS type, inferior margin of ≤5 cm from the anal verge. The primary endpoint of this trial is complete clinical response (cCR) rate. Immunotherapy is added after 1 week of chemoradiotherapy for two cycles, and then the patients will be administered two cycles of immunotherapy and CAPOX. The evaluations will be carried out after the completion of the whole neoadjuvant therapy. We expect the programme to improve the cCR rate and the quality of life for patients with ultra-low rectal cancer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Ethics committee of Changhai Hospital and other medical centres (Grant number:CHEC2022-118).

The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism recommends oral nutritional supplements (ONS) as a first-line nutritional therapy to prevent malnutrition in patients with cancer. However, adherence to ONS is unsatisfactory. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence of patients with gastric cancer to ONS and to explore the promoting and hindering factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this study, we will use mixed methods with an explanatory sequential approach for data collection and analysis. In the first phase, a 12-week longitudinal study will be performed to identify changes in trends of oral nutritional supplementation adherence in 135 patients with gastric cancer, the impact of adherence on nutritional indicators and clinical outcomes and ONS adherence-related factors. The primary endpoints include patient adherence to ONS, weight, body mass index and grip strength followed by 30-day readmission rate, complications and adverse reactions. In the second stage, qualitative research will be implemented to provide in-depth insight into the quantitative results. Finally, quantitative and qualitative results will be combined for analysis and discussion to put forward suggestions for improving patients' ONS adherence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing, Jilin University, China (No. 2019101601).

1533,27881152,Trials,Fitness and mobility training in patients with Intensive Care Unit-acquired muscle weakness (FITonICU): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness myopathy (CIM) and polyneuropathy (CIP) are a common complication of critical illness. Both cause intensive-care-unit-acquired (ICU-acquired) muscle weakness (ICUAW) which increases morbidity and delays rehabilitation and recovery of activities of daily living such as walking ability. Focused physical rehabilitation of people with ICUAW is, therefore, of great importance at both an individual and a societal level. A recent systematic Cochrane review found no randomised controlled trials (RCT), and thus no supporting evidence, for physical rehabilitation interventions for people with defined CIP and CIM to improve activities of daily living. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the effects of an additional physiotherapy programme with systematically augmented levels of mobilisation with additional in-bed cycling (as the parallel group) on walking and other activities of daily living. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a prospective, rater-masked RCT of people with ICUAW with a defined diagnosis of CIM and/or CIP in our post-acute hospital. We will randomly assign patients to one of two parallel groups in a 1:1 ratio and will use a concealed allocation. One intervention group will receive, in addition to standard ICU treatment, physiotherapy with systematically augmented levels of mobilisation (five times per week, over 2 weeks; 20 min each session; with a total of 10 additional sessions). The other intervention group will receive, in addition to standard ICU treatment, in-bed cycle sessions (same number, frequency and treatment time as the intervention group). Standard ICU treatment includes sitting balance exercise, stretching, positioning, and sit-to-stand training, and transfer training to get out of bed, strengthening exercise (in and out of bed), and stepping and assistive standing exercises. Primary efficacy endpoints will be walking ability (defined as a Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) level of ≥3) and the sum score of the Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU) (range 0-22 points) assessed by a blinded tester immediately after 2 weeks of additional therapy. Secondary outcomes will include assessment of sit-to-stand recovery, overall limb strength (Medical Research Council, MRC) and grip strength, the Physical Function for the Intensive Care Unit Test-Scored (PFIT-S), the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNL-Index) assessed by a blinded tester. We will measure primary and secondary outcomes with blinded assessors at baseline, immediately after 2 weeks of additional therapy, and at 3 weeks and 6 months and 12 months after the end of the additional therapy intervention. Based on our sample size calculation 108 patients will be recruited from our post-acute ICU in the next 3 to 4 years. DISCUSSION: This will be the first RCT comparing the effects of two physical rehabilitation interventions for people with ICUAW due to defined CIP and/or CIM to improve walking and other activities of daily living. The results of this trial will provide robust evidence for physical rehabilitation of people with CIP and/or CIP who often require long-term care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: We registered the study on 6 April 2016 before enrolling the first patient in the trial at the German Clinical Trials Register ( www.germanctr.de ) with the identifier DRKS00010269 .

1534,30788136,Pilot and feasibility studies,Can meditation improve attention in older adults? Study protocol for a 4-week proof-of-concept intervention,"BACKGROUND: Falls are a major health care concern for our aging population. Previous research has identified impaired sustained attention as a risk factor for falls. Recently, meditation has been shown to improve different types of attention in various populations. However, there are no studies to date examining whether meditation training can improve sustained attention and mobility in older adults. METHODS: We are conducting a 4-week proof-of-concept meditation intervention. We will recruit community-dwelling older adults. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: (1) meditation training or (2) music listening (control). All participants will complete three 20-min group sessions per week and will be encouraged to continue their practice independently on the remaining days each week. Our primary outcome measure is behavioral performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Our secondary and tertiary outcomes include electroencephalograms (EEG) to assess attention and cognitive processing, mobility, and executive function. DISCUSSION: Our proof-of-concept intervention aims to examine whether meditation training can improve sustained attention in older adults, who are known to be susceptible to falls. Importantly, our research has the potential to inform future clinical trials aimed at improving mobility and reducing falls risk in our aging population.

1535,31331292,BMC pregnancy and childbirth,The PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM): study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial of two active interventions addressing perinatal depression in obstetric settings,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression, the most common pregnancy complication, is associated with negative maternal-offspring outcomes. Despite existence of effective treatments, it is under-recognized and under-treated. Professional organizations recommend universal screening, yet multi-level barriers exist to ensuring effective diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Integrating mental health and obstetric care holds significant promise for addressing perinatal depression. The overall study goal is to compare the effectiveness of two active interventions: (1) the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program (MCPAP) for Moms, a state-wide, population-based program, and (2) the PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM) which includes MCPAP for Moms plus a proactive, multifaceted, practice-level intervention with intensive implementation support. METHODS: This study is conducted in two phases: (1) a run-in phase which has been completed and involved practice and patient participant recruitment to demonstrate feasibility for the second phase, and (2) a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is ongoing, and will compare two active interventions 1:1 with ten Ob/Gyn practices as the unit of randomization. In phase 1, rates of depressive symptoms and other demographic and clinical features among patients were examined to inform practice randomization. Patient participants to be recruited in phase 2 will be followed longitudinally until 13 months postpartum; they will have 3-5 total study visits depending on whether their initial recruitment and interview was at 4-24 or 32-40 weeks gestation, or 1-3 months postpartum. Sampling throughout pregnancy and postpartum will ensure participants with different depressive symptom onset times. Differences in depression symptomatology and treatment participation will be compared between patient participants by intervention arm. DISCUSSION: This manuscript describes the full two-phase study protocol. The study design is innovative because it combines effectiveness with implementation research designs and integrates critical components of participatory action research. Our approach assesses the feasibility, acceptance, efficacy, and sustainability of integrating a stepped-care approach to perinatal depression care into ambulatory obstetric settings; an approach that is flexible and can be tailored and adapted to fit unique workflows of real-world practices.

1536,19040767,BMC geriatrics,Autonomy among physically frail older people in nursing home settings: a study protocol for an intervention study,"BACKGROUND: Experiencing autonomy is recognised to promote health and well-being for all age groups. Perceived lack of control has been found to be detrimental to physical and mental health. There is a lack of evidence-based knowledge elucidating how frail older people in nursing home settings themselves perceive autonomy in daily life. Further, there are no studies on the extent to which this perception can be influenced positively by participating in an individually tailored programme based on residents' own wishes for daily activities. METHODS AND DESIGN: A total of 9 nursing homes and 55 participants aged 65 years or older were included in the study. All the participants were restricted in performing at least one P-ADL activity unassisted and had a Mini Mental State Examination-score above 16. Perceived autonomy was measured at baseline, after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks by The Autonomy Sub-dimension in the Measure of Actualisation of Potential test. Programmes were based on participants' individual assessment of their most important daily activities. Staff at all nursing homes who usually organize physical training, social or creative activities carried out individually tailored programmes using their usual methods and equipment. Participants in each nursing home were divided by lot into either a control group or an intervention group. The control groups received their usual care and treatment. DISCUSSION: This study is designed to assess the status of perceived autonomy at baseline and to provide information about the effectiveness of individually tailored programmes according to perceptions of autonomy registered in institutionalised physically frail older people. This will add knowledge to assist response to present and future challenges in relation to health promotion initiatives for this group.",,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

1538,34222793,General psychiatry,Online single-session interventions for Kenyan adolescents: study protocol for a comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Mental health problems are the leading cause of disability among adolescents worldwide, yet access to treatment is limited. Brief digital interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is known about which digital interventions are most effective. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions (Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan adolescents. METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements (assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not have a preplanned hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help us evaluate two digital single-session interventions with different theoretical foundations. If effective, such interventions could be disseminated to reduce the public health burden of common mental health problems.

1539,25604206,BMC public health,Randomized controlled trial of a minimal versus extended Internet-based intervention for problem drinkers: study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Problem drinking causes great harm to the person and to society. Most problem drinkers will never seek treatment. The current trial will test the efficacy of two Internet interventions for problem drinking - one minimal and the other extended - as an alternate means of providing help to those in need. METHODS/DESIGN: A double blinded, four-wave panel design with random assignment to two experimental conditions will be used in this study. Participants will be recruited through a comprehensive recruitment strategy consisting of online and print advertisements asking for people who are 'interested in helping us develop and evaluate Internet-based interventions for problem drinkers.' Potential participants will be screened to select problem drinkers who have home access to the Internet. Participants will be sent to a password-protected Internet site and, upon signing in, will be randomized to be provided access to the minimal or extended Internet-based intervention. Six-month, twelve-month, and two-year drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental conditions. The primary hypothesis is that participants in the extended Internet intervention condition will display significantly improved drinking outcomes at twelve months compared to participants in the minimal intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings of this trial will contribute to the growing literature on Internet interventions for problem drinkers. In addition, findings from this trial will contribute to the scarce literature available evaluating the long-term efficacy of brief interventions for alcohol problems.

1541,34294137,Trials,Effects of real-time feedback during decline walking on kinematic and kinetic gait parameters in a healthy population: study protocol for a randomized trial - up and down,"BACKGROUND: The control of the dynamic functional leg alignment (dFLA) and biomechanical load are important joint-related aspects regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Research on level walking with feedback on load-related parameters has provided innovative treatment possibilities. With regard to walking on sloped surfaces, fundamental biomechanical knowledge exists. However, comprehensive data on the agreement of kinematics and kinetics of self-paced ramp versus sloped treadmill walking is lacking. Further, deeper insights into the control of the dFLA during decline walking and the usefulness of real-time feedback are missing. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty healthy participants aged between 18 and 35 years will be included. They will complete a three-dimensional gait analysis walking self-paced up and down on a 5-m ramp with a 10° inclination. Subsequently, speed-matched to ramp-up walking and self-paced 10° incline split-belt treadmill walking will be assessed. Afterwards, the participants will be observed under four different conditions of 10° declined walking on the same treadmill (a) self-paced walking, (b) self-paced walking with an internal focus of attention, (c) self-paced walking with real-time feedback, and (d) condition c speed-matched walking. The primary outcome parameter will be the frontal knee range of motion (fKROM). Secondary outcomes include the ground reaction force loading rate, spatial-temporal parameters, as well as sagittal, frontal and transversal kinematics, and kinetics for the lower extremities. DISCUSSION: The findings aim at improving the understanding of the effects of real-time feedback on the control of the dFLA and lower limb loading. Following clinical practicable methods for effective feedback devices can be developed and evaluated. Additionally, the first dataset comparing kinematic and kinetic parameters for decline and incline ramp walking versus walking on an instrumented treadmill will be available for appropriate intervention planning.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is one of the most effective medications to reduce the volume of fibroids and the uterus. However, its role in preventing recurrence after conservative surgery remains unclear. At present, there is no randomised clinical trial determining the efficacy of GnRHa treatment for preventing multiple leiomyomas recurrence after myomectomy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a phase IV randomised controlled trial in women aged 18-45 undergoing myomectomy for multiple leiomyomas. After surgery, women whose pathological result confirms multiple leiomyomas are randomised in a 1:1 ratio into an observation or GnRHa group. The primary outcome is the recurrence of either clinical symptoms or fibroids on imaging. Patients will be assessed for adverse events during the follow-up.

1544,25926152,BMJ open,A minimally invasive technique for decompression of Chiari malformation type I (DECMI study): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"INTRODUCTION: Chiari malformation type I (CM-I) is a congenital hindbrain anomaly that requires surgical decompression in symptomatic patients. Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) has been widely practiced in Chiari decompression, but dural opening carries a high risk of surgical complications. A minimally invasive technique, dural splitting decompression (DSD), preserves the inner layer of the dura without dural opening and duraplasty, potentially reducing surgical complications, length of operative time and hospital stay, and cost. If DSD is non-inferior to PFDD in terms of clinical improvement, DSD could be an alternative treatment modality for CM-I. So far, no randomised study of surgical treatment of CM-I has been reported. This study aims to evaluate if DSD is an effective, safe and cost-saving treatment modality for adult CM-I patients, and may provide evidence for using the minimally invasive procedure extensively. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DECMI is a randomised controlled, single-masked, non-inferiority, single centre clinical trial. Participants meeting the criteria will be randomised to the DSD group and the PFDD group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the rate of clinical improvement, which is defined as the complete resolution or partial improvement of the presenting symptoms/signs. The secondary outcomes consist of the incidence of syrinx reduction, postoperative morbidity rates, reoperation rate, quality of life (QoL) and healthcare resource utilisation. A total of 160 patients will be included and followed up at 3 and 12 months postoperatively.

It is a strong risk factor for depression and is related to an increase in suicide and mortality. Studies suggest that acupuncture may be effective in the treatment of subthreshold depression, but no evidence has proven that the efficacy of acupuncture for subthreshold depression is a specific therapeutic effect or a placebo effect. METHODS: This will be a prospective, randomized, controlled, and double-blind study of 64 patients with subthreshold depression. They will be randomly assigned as verum or minimal acupuncture group members. Patients in the verum acupuncture group will receive acupuncture at the acupoints, and those in the minimal acupuncture group will receive minimal acupuncture at non-acupoints. The interventions will be delivered over an 8-week period. The primary outcome measure will be the Hamilton Depression Scale-17 (HAMD-17). The secondary outcome measures will be the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7), and SF-12v2 Health Survey. The assessments will occur at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and during a follow-up period.

However, there is a lack of rigorous research investigating this issue. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of music therapy and physical activity on brain plasticity, mood, and cognition in a population with AD and at risk for AD. METHODS: One-hundred and thirty-five participants with memory complaints will be recruited for a parallel, three-arm Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). Inclusion criteria are a diagnosis of mild (early) AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or memory complaints without other neuropsychiatric pathology. Participants are randomised into either a music therapy intervention (singing lessons), an active control group (physical activity) or a passive control group (no intervention) for 12 months. The primary outcomes are the brain age gap, measured via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes include cognitive performance, activities of daily living, brain structure (voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging), and brain function (resting-state functional MRI). TRIAL STATUS: Screening of participants began in April 2018. A total of 84 participants have been recruited and started intervention, out of which 48 participants have completed 12 months of intervention and post-intervention assessment.

In 2005, the mean cost for a CABG procedure among Medicare beneficiaries in the USA was $32, 201 ± $23,059. The same operation reportedly costs less than $2000 to produce in India. The goals of the proposed study are to (1) identify the difference in the costs incurred to perform CABG surgery by three Joint Commission accredited hospitals with reputations for high quality and efficiency and (2) characterise the opportunity to reduce the cost of performing CABG surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to quantify the hospitals' costs of producing elective, multivessel CABG. TDABC estimates the costs of a given clinical service by combining information about the process of patient care delivery (specifically, the time and quantity of labour and non-labour resources utilised to perform each activity) with the unit cost of each resource used to provide the care. Resource utilisation was estimated by constructing CABG process maps for each site based on observation of care and staff interviews. Unit costs were calculated as a capacity cost rate, measured as a $/min, for each resource consumed in CABG production. Multiplying together the unit costs and resource quantities and summing across all resources used will produce the average cost of CABG production at each site. We will conclude by conducting a variance analysis of labour costs to reveal opportunities to bend the cost curve for CABG production in the USA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All our methods were exempted from review by the Stanford Institutional Review Board. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.",HEALTH ECONOMICS,Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Excess mortality and hospitalisation have been associated with hyperkalaemia (HK) after the long (2-day) interdialytic interval (LIDI) in patients on thrice a week HD compared with the short (1-day) interdialytic interval. Moreover, not much research has been conducted in China on the descriptive epidemiology and management of HK among different HD centres. The aim of this study is to address this evidence gap by investigating the risk factors associated with HK clinical burden at the HD facility level, current HD centres management patterns, serum potassium management patterns, as well as the risk factors associated with crude mortality in China. DESIGN: Multicentre, observational, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study plans to enrol 300 HD centres across China. Haemodialysis centres having ≥100 patients on maintenance HD within 3 years before study initiation, with participation willingness, routine blood collection post-LIDI and death records will be included. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥18 years and on chronic HD for ≥3 months will be considered eligible. Summary data about serum potassium, characteristics of patients, facility practice patterns will be collected at HD facility level and death records will be at the patient level. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome will be to examine the association between suspected risk factors and HK prevalence at HD facility level. Suspected risk factors include dialysis prescriptions and serum potassium testing frequency, characteristics of patients and related medication usage. The secondary outcome will be to determine the HK prevalence, serum potassium management pattern and risk factors associated with crude mortality. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using regression models. Exploratory outcomes will further investigate the risk factors associated with serum potassium ≥6.0 and ≥6.5 mmol/L.

1550,24068437,Social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology,"Genetic attributions and mental illness diagnosis: effects on perceptions of danger, social distance, and real helping decisions","Genetic essentialism suggests that beliefs in genetic causes of mental illness will inflate a desire for social distance from affected individuals, regardless of specific disorder. However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous. PURPOSE: To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders. METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions. RESULTS: When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition. CONCLUSION: Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

The aim of this initial methodological study was to develop a plasma input tracer kinetic model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 binding in healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to provide a preliminary assessment whether there is a disease-related signal. Ten AD patients and six healthy subjects underwent a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) study along with arterial sampling and a scan protocol of 150 minutes after administration of 250 ± 10 MBq [(18)F]DPA-714. The model that provided the best fits to tissue time activity curves (TACs) was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion and F-test. The reversible two tissue compartment plasma input model with blood volume parameter was the preferred model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 kinetics, irrespective of scan duration, volume of interest, and underlying volume of distribution (VT). Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM)-derived binding potential (BPND) using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue correlated well with plasma input-based distribution volume ratio (DVR). These data suggest that [(18)F]DPA-714 cannot be used for separating individual AD patients from healthy subjects, but further studies including TSPO binding status are needed to substantiate these findings.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1552,2186274,The New England journal of medicine,The effect on test ordering of informing physicians of the charges for outpatient diagnostic tests,"We studied the effect of informing physicians of the charges for outpatient diagnostic tests on their ordering of such tests in an academic primary care medical practice. All tests were ordered at microcomputer workstations by 121 physicians. For half (the intervention group), the charge for the test being ordered and the total charge for tests for that patient on that day were displayed on the computer screen. The remaining physicians (control group) also used the computers but received no message about charges. The primary outcomes measured were the number of tests ordered and the charges for tests per patient visit. In the 14 weeks before the study, the number of tests ordered and the average charge for tests per patient visit were similar for the intervention and control groups. During the 26-week intervention period, the physicians in the intervention group ordered 14 percent fewer tests per patient visit than did those in the control group (P less than 0.005), and the charges for tests were 13 percent ($6.68 per visit) lower (P less than 0.05). The differences were greater for scheduled visits (17 percent fewer tests and 15 percent lower charges for the intervention group; P less than 0.01) than for unscheduled (urgent) visits (11 percent fewer tests and 10 percent lower charges; P greater than 0.3). During the 19 weeks after the intervention ended, the number of tests ordered by the physicians in the intervention group was only 7.7 percent lower than the number ordered by the physicians in the control group, and the charges for tests were only 3.5 percent lower (P greater than 0.3). Three measures of possible adverse outcomes--number of hospitalizations, emergency room visits, and outpatient visits during the study period and the following six months--were similar for the patients seen by the physicians in both groups. We conclude that displaying the charges for diagnostic tests significantly reduced the number and cost of tests ordered, especially for patients with scheduled visits.

1553,10875051,,Longitudinal study of the influence of life events and personality status on diagnostic change in three neurotic disorders,"It has been known for many years that diagnosis within the neurotic spectrum of disorders is temporally unstable and also that life events can be major precipitants of change in symptoms. Reasons for this instability could include inherent inadequacy of current diagnostic practice, the influence of life events as an agent of diagnostic shift, and an innate course of disorder with features dependent on the stage at which disorder presents (e.g., development of panic to agoraphobia). These possibilities were examined in a prospective study that was initially a randomised controlled trial. Two hundred ten patients recruited from primary care psychiatric clinics with DSM-III diagnosed dysthymic, generalised anxiety, and panic disorders were randomly allocated to either drug treatment (mainly antidepressants), cognitive-behaviour therapy, or self-help therapy over a 2 year period, irrespective of original diagnosis. Life events were recorded by using a standard procedure over the period 6 months before starting treatment and at five occasions over 2 years; 181 (86%) of the patients had follow-up data and 76% maintained compliance with the original treatment allocated over the 2 years; and 155 of the 181 patients (86%) had at least one diagnostic change in this period. There was no difference in the number of diagnostic changes between the three original diagnostic groups, but dysthymic disorder changed more frequently to major depressive episode than did GAD or panic disorder (20; 11; 12) (%) and panic disorder changed more frequently to agoraphobia (with or without panic) than did dysthymia or GAD (18; 8; 6) (%). There was no relationship between loss events and depressive diagnoses or between addition events and anxiety diagnoses, but greater numbers of conflict events were associated with diagnostic change. More life events were associated with the flamboyant and dependent personality disorders, reinforcing other evidence that many life events are internally generated by personality characteristics and cannot be regarded as truly independent.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this trial was to compare exercise endurance, functional status, and quality of life (QOL) among high-risk patients randomized to either routine or selective functional testing following PCI. METHODS: We randomized 84 patients to either routine or selective functional testing. Patients had one or more of the following: multivessel PCI, diabetes mellitus, left ventricular ejection fraction < 35%, and/or PCI of the proximal left anterior descending artery. Patients in the routine arm (n = 41) underwent maximum endurance exercise treadmill testing (ETT) with nuclear perfusion imaging at 1.5 and 6 months. Patients in the selective arm (n = 43) only underwent functional testing for a clinical indication. All patients underwent a maximum endurance ETT at 9 months. Exercise endurance, functional status, and QOL were assessed at 9 months. RESULTS: Most patients were middle-aged men (58 +/- 10 years old; 87% male) who underwent PCI with stenting (94%). Among routine functional testing patients, 27.0% and 41.9% had a positive functional test at 1.5 and 6 months, respectively. Exercise endurance was improved in the routine vs. selective arm at 9 months (metabolic equivalents: 10.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 8.6 +/- 3.0, P = 0.013). There was no difference in improvement from baseline for the Duke Activity Status Index, the Seattle Angina Questionnaire, or the SF-36. Nine-month cumulative incidences of cardiac procedures and clinical events were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Routine functional testing following PCI in high-risk patients may lead to improved exercise endurance but not improved QOL.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1555,37794830,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Prospective comparison of diagnostic tests for bile acid diarrhoea,"BACKGROUND: Bile acid diarrhoea is often missed because gold standard nuclear medicine tauroselcholic [75-Se] acid (SeHCAT) testing has limited availability. Empirical treatment effect has unknown diagnostic performance, whereas plasma 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) is inexpensive but lacks sensitivity. AIMS: To determine diagnostic characteristics of empirical treatment and explore improvements in diagnostics with potential better availability than SeHCAT. METHODS: This diagnostic accuracy study was part of a randomised, placebo-controlled trial of colesevelam. Consecutive patients with chronic diarrhoea attending SeHCAT had blood and stool sampled. Key thresholds were C4 > 46 ng/mL and SeHCAT retention ≤10%. A questionnaire recorded patient-reported empirical treatment effect. We analysed receiver operating characteristics and explored machine learning applied logistic regression and decision tree modelling with internal validation. RESULTS: Ninety-six (38%) of 251 patients had SeHCAT retention ≤10%. The effect of empirical treatment assessed with test results for bile acid studies blinded had 63% (95% confidence interval 44%-79%) sensitivity and 65% (47%-80%) specificity; C4 > 46 ng/mL had 47% (37%-57%) and 92% (87%-96%), respectively. A decision tree combining C4 ≥ 31 ng/mL with ≥1.1 daily watery stools (Bristol type 6 and 7) had 70% (51%-85%) sensitivity and 95% (83%-99%) specificity. The logistic regression model, including C4, the sum of measured stool bile acids and daily watery stools, had 77% (58%-90%) sensitivity and 93% (80%-98%) specificity. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnosis of bile acid diarrhoea using empirical treatment was inadequate. Exploration suggested considerable improvements in the sensitivity of C4-based testing, offering potential widely available diagnostics. Further validation is warranted.

1557,36036496,The New England journal of medicine,Routine Functional Testing or Standard Care in High-Risk Patients after PCI,"BACKGROUND: There are limited data from randomized trials to guide a specific follow-up surveillance approach after myocardial revascularization. Whether a follow-up strategy that includes routine functional testing improves clinical outcomes among high-risk patients who have undergone percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned 1706 patients with high-risk anatomical or clinical characteristics who had undergone PCI to a follow-up strategy of routine functional testing (nuclear stress testing, exercise electrocardiography, or stress echocardiography) at 1 year after PCI or to standard care alone. The primary outcome was a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, or hospitalization for unstable angina at 2 years. Key secondary outcomes included invasive coronary angiography and repeat revascularization. RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 64.7 years, 21.0% had left main disease, 43.5% had bifurcation disease, 69.8% had multivessel disease, 70.1% had diffuse long lesions, 38.7% had diabetes, and 96.4% had been treated with drug-eluting stents. At 2 years, a primary-outcome event had occurred in 46 of 849 patients (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 5.5%) in the functional-testing group and in 51 of 857 (Kaplan-Meier estimate, 6.0%) in the standard-care group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1.35; P = 0.62). There were no between-group differences with respect to the components of the primary outcome. At 2 years, 12.3% of the patients in the functional-testing group and 9.3% in the standard-care group had undergone invasive coronary angiography (difference, 2.99 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.01 to 5.99), and 8.1% and 5.8% of patients, respectively, had undergone repeat revascularization (difference, 2.23 percentage points; 95% CI, -0.22 to 4.68). CONCLUSIONS: Among high-risk patients who had undergone PCI, a follow-up strategy of routine functional testing, as compared with standard care alone, did not improve clinical outcomes at 2 years.

1558,31023125,Scandinavian journal of urology,The rate of deterioration of erectile function increases with age: results from a longitudinal population based survey.,"Background: Increasing age as a risk factor for erectile dysfunction (ED) is in most studies assumed to be a linear function. If this is not the case the assumption could lead to bias, e.g. when men of different ages are compared in interventional studies on ED. Objective: To explore the risk of developing ED over time for men from different age groups. Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to a number of male residents in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 1992 (n = 10,458). Men were randomly selected according to year of birth to obtain several cohorts at 5-year intervals of ages 45, 50, 55 years, etc., up to the age of 85 or older. In 2003 an analogous, slightly expanded, questionnaire was sent to a random sample of men from the age cohorts 46, 51 years, etc. (n = 10,845). A total of 4072 men received both surveys, thereby constituting a group of men followed longitudinally for 11 years. The future risk of developing ED in the different age cohorts, adjusted for a number of ED risk factors, was then assessed. Results: A total of 3257 men responded to both questionnaires (response rate = 80%, age range = 56-103 years). The risk of having ED increased substantially with increasing age, both within each survey and longitudinally between the surveys. The adjusted risk of developing ED within the next 11 years increased with a factor of 10, from 1.8% at the age of 45 years at baseline to as much as 11.4% at the age of 65 years. Conclusion: Age as a risk-factor for ED is a non-linear function and should be adjusted as such to avoid bias when including men of different ages in interventional studies on ED.",Longitudinal survey| age| epidemiology| erectile dysfunction| risk-factors,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1559,26306891,World journal of surgery,A Randomised Assessment of Trainee Doctors' Understanding and Interpretation of Diagnostic Test Results,"INTRODUCTION: Doctors are unfamiliar with diagnostic accuracy parameters despite routine clinical use of diagnostic tests to estimate disease probability. METHODS: Trainee doctors completed a questionnaire exploring their understanding of diagnostic accuracy parameters; ability to calculate post-test probability of a common surgical condition (appendicitis) and their perceptions on training in this area. To determine whether the method of information provision altered interpretation, trainees were randomised to receive diagnostic test information in three ways: positive test only; positive test with specificity and sensitivity; positive test with positive likelihood ratio in layman terms. RESULTS: 326 candidates were recruited across 30 training sessions. Trainees scored a median of three out of seven in questions concerning knowledge of diagnostic accuracy parameters. This was affected neither by training level (P = 0.737) nor by experience in acute general surgery (P = 0.738). 30 (11.8%) candidates correctly estimated post-test probability; with 86.6% overestimating this value. Neither level of training (P = 0.180) nor experience (P = 0.242) influenced the accuracy of the estimate. Provision of the ultrasound scan results in different ways was not associated with likelihood of a correct response (P = 0.857). CONCLUSION: This study highlights the deficiencies in trainee doctors' understanding and application of diagnostic tests results. Most trainees over-estimated disease probability, increasing the risk of unnecessary intervention and treatment.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

Malaria diagnosis is routinely performed by microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) in the field settings; however, their performance may vary across regions, age and asymptomatic status. Owing to this, we assessed the diagnostic performance of conventional and advanced molecular tools for malaria detection in low and high malaria-endemic settings. We performed mass blood surveys in low and high endemic regions of two North-Eastern districts from the states of Assam and Meghalaya. A total of 3322 individuals were screened for malaria using RDT, microscopy and PCR and measures of diagnostic accuracy were estimated. Out of 3322 individuals, 649 (19.5%) were detected with malaria parasite. Asymptomatic were 86.4% (2872/3322), of which 19.4% (557/2872) had Plasmodium infection. The sensitivity and specificity of microscopy were 42.7% and 99.3%, and RDT showed 49.9% and 90.4%, respectively, considering PCR as standard. RDT (AUC: 0.65 vs 0.74; p = 0.001) and microscopy (AUC: 0.64 vs 0.76; p < 0.0001) performances were significantly lower in low compared to high endemic areas. True positive rate was lower in asymptomatics but true negative rate was found similar to symptomatic individuals. The conventional diagnostic tools (RDT and microscopy) had detected malaria in children with nearly twofold greater sensitivity than in the adults (p < 0.05). To conclude, asymptomatics, adults and low malaria-endemic regions require major attention due to mediocre performance of conventional diagnostic tools in malaria detection.",Asymptomatic| Diagnosis| Endemicity| Malaria| Molecular method,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

METHODS: This was an open-label randomized controlled trial conducted at a hospital in Kenya between May 2018 and February 2020. Low-risk pregnant women were randomly allocated (ratio of 1:1) to routine ultrasound for fetal growth assessment between 36 + 0 and 37 + 6 weeks' gestation (intervention group) or to standard care, which involved a selective growth scan on clinical suspicion of fetal growth abnormality based on serial SFH measurements (control group). During ultrasound examination, fetal growth was assessed by measurement of the abdominal circumference (AC), and AC < 10(th) centile was used to diagnose a SGA fetus. The main prespecified outcomes were the detection of neonatal SGA, defined as birth weight < 10(th) centile, and of severe neonatal SGA, defined as birth weight < 3(rd) centile. The predictive performance of routine third-trimester ultrasound and selective ultrasound based on serial SFH measurements was determined using receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC)-curve analysis. RESULTS: Of 566 women assessed for eligibility, 508 (89.8%) were randomized, of whom 253 were allocated to the intervention group and 255 to the control group. Thirty-six babies in the intervention group and 26 in the control group had a birth weight < 10(th) centile. The detection rate of SGA infants by routine third-trimester ultrasound vs that by standard care was 52.8% (19/36) vs 7.7% (2/26) (P < 0.001) and the specificity was 95.5% (191/200) and 97.9% (191/195), respectively (P = 0.08). The detection rate of severe SGA was 66.7% (12/18) by routine ultrasound vs 8.3% (1/12) by selective ultrasound based on SFH measurements (P < 0.001), with specificities of 91.7% (200/218) and 98.1% (205/209), respectively (P = 0.006). The area under the ROC curve of routine third-trimester ultrasound in prediction of SGA was significantly greater than that of selective ultrasound based on SFH measurements (0.92 (95% CI, 0.87-0.96) vs 0.68 (95% CI, 0.58-0.77); P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In low-risk pregnancy, routine ultrasound performed between 36 + 0 and 37 + 6 weeks is superior to selective ultrasound based on serial SFH measurements for the detection of true SGA, with high specificity. © 2021 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.",fetal growth restriction| low-risk pregnancy| small-for-gestational age| third-trimester ultrasound,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

The group with hidden disorders were randomly assigned to a treated index group and an untreated control group. The effects of case detection and treatment were beneficial and immediate, with the duration of episode of the disorder being much shorter for patients whose disorder was recognised by the general practitioner. For patients with more severe disorders there are significant differences still demonstrable between the groups one year later; but patients with mild disorders do equally well, some recovering spontaneously but others becoming manifest to the general practitioner over the next year and so receiving treatment.

1563,20236174,European journal of neurology,Caudate atrophy on MRI is a characteristic feature of FTLD-FUS,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be subdivided into those in which the abnormal protein is tau (FTLD-TAU), the TAR DNA binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) and the fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). We have observed severe caudate atrophy at autopsy in FTLD-FUS, and hence, we aimed to determine whether caudate atrophy on MRI is a feature that can distinguish FTLD-FUS from FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU. METHODS: From a cohort of 207 cases of FTLD, we identified all cases of FTLD-FUS that had a volumetric antemortem head MRI (n = 3). Caudate and frontal lobe volumes were measured in all three cases using atlas-based parcellation and SPM5 and were compared to 10 randomly selected cases of FTLD-TDP and 10 randomly selected cases of FTLD-TAU. Total grey matter volumes were also calculated for all cases. RESULTS: The FTLD-FUS cases had significantly smaller caudate volumes (P = 0.02) yet similar frontal lobe grey matter volumes (P = 0.12) compared to FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU. Caudate volumes when corrected for total grey matter volume (P = 0.01) or frontal lobe grey matter volume (P = 0.01) were significantly smaller in FTLD-FUS than in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU and showed no overlap with the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Caudate atrophy on MRI appears to be significantly greater in FTLD-FUS compared with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU, suggesting that severe caudate atrophy may be a useful clinical feature to predict FTLD-FUS pathology.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

OBJECTIVE: To estimate PTSD prevalence among depressed military veteran primary care patients and compare demographic/illness characteristics of PTSD screen-positive depressed patients (MDD-PTSD+) to those with depression alone (MDD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of MDD patients versus MDD-PTSD+ patients. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred seventy-seven randomly sampled depressed patients with at least 1 primary care visit in the previous 12 months. Participants composed the baseline sample of a group randomized trial of collaborative care for depression in 10 VA primary care practices in 5 states. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessed MDD. Probable PTSD was defined as a Primary Care PTSD Screen > or = 3. Regression-based techniques compared MDD and MDD-PTSD+ patients on demographic/illness characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of depressed patients screened positive for PTSD. Adjusting for sociodemographic differences and physical illness comorbidity, MDD-PTSD+ patients reported more severe depression (P < .001), lower social support (P < .001), more frequent outpatient health care visits (P < .001), and were more likely to report suicidal ideation (P < .001) than MDD patients. No differences were observed in alcohol consumption, self-reported general health, and physical illness comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is more common among depressed primary care patients than previously thought. Comorbid PTSD among depressed patients is associated with increased illness burden, poorer prognosis, and delayed response to depression treatment. Providers should consider recommending psychotherapeutic interventions for depressed patients with PTSD.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1565,24974383,Brain : a journal of neurology,"Pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex in post-stroke, vascular and other ageing-related dementias","Dementia associated with cerebrovascular disease is common. It has been reported that ∼30% of elderly patients who survive stroke develop delayed dementia (post-stroke dementia), with most cases being diagnosed as vascular dementia. The pathological substrates associated with post-stroke or vascular dementia are poorly understood, particularly those associated with executive dysfunction. Three separate yet interconnecting circuits control executive function within the frontal lobe involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. We used stereological methods, along with immunohistological and related cell morphometric analysis, to examine densities and volumes of pyramidal neurons of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in the frontal lobe from a total of 90 elderly subjects (age range 71-98 years). Post-mortem brain tissues from post-stroke dementia and post-stroke patients with no dementia were derived from our prospective Cognitive Function After Stroke study. We also examined, in parallel, samples from ageing controls and similar age subjects pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, and vascular dementia. We found pyramidal cell volumes in layers III and V in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post-stroke and vascular dementia and, of mixed and Alzheimer's disease subjects to be reduced by 30-40% compared to post-stroke patients with no dementia and controls. There were no significant changes in neuronal volumes in either the anterior cingulate or orbitofrontal cortices. Remarkably, pyramidal neurons within the orbitofrontal cortex were also found to be smaller in size when compared to those in the other two neocortical regions. To relate the cell changes to cognitive function, we noted significant correlations between neuronal volumes and total CAMCOG, orientation and memory scores and clinical dementia ratings. Total estimated neuronal densities were not significantly changed between patients with post-stroke dementia and post-stroke patients with no dementia groups or ageing controls in any of the three frontal regions. In further morphometric analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we showed that neither diffuse cerebral atrophy nor neocortical thickness explained the selective neuronal volume effects. We also noted that neurofilament protein SMI31 immunoreactivity was increased in post-stroke and vascular dementia compared with post-stroke patients with no dementia and correlated with decreased neuronal volumes in subjects with post-stroke dementia and vascular dementia. Our findings suggest selective regional pyramidal cell atrophy in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-rather than neuronal density changes per se-are associated with dementia and executive dysfunction in post-stroke dementia and vascular dementia. The changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells were not associated with neurofibrillary pathology suggesting there is a vascular basis for the observed highly selective neuronal atrophy.",Alzheimer’s disease| ageing| executive function| post-stroke dementia| prefrontal cortex| stroke| vascular dementia,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1566,29860473,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Macimorelin as a Diagnostic Test for Adult GH Deficiency,"PURPOSE: The diagnosis of adult GH deficiency (AGHD) is challenging and often requires confirmation with a GH stimulation test (GHST). The insulin tolerance test (ITT) is considered the reference standard GHST but is labor intensive, can cause severe hypoglycemia, and is contraindicated for certain patients. Macimorelin, an orally active GH secretagogue, could be used to diagnose AGHD by measuring stimulated GH levels after an oral dose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present multicenter, open-label, randomized, two-way crossover trial was designed to validate the efficacy and safety of single-dose oral macimorelin for AGHD diagnosis compared with the ITT. Subjects with high (n = 38), intermediate (n = 37), and low (n = 39) likelihood for AGHD and healthy, matched controls (n = 25) were included in the efficacy analysis. RESULTS: After the first test, 99% of macimorelin tests and 82% of ITTs were evaluable. Using GH cutoff levels of 2.8 ng/mL for macimorelin and 5.1 ng/mL for ITTs, the negative agreement was 95.38% (95% CI, 87% to 99%), the positive agreement was 74.32% (95% CI, 63% to 84%), sensitivity was 87%, and specificity was 96%. On retesting, the reproducibility was 97% for macimorelin (n = 33). In post hoc analyses, a GH cutoff of 5.1 ng/mL for both tests resulted in 94% (95% CI, 85% to 98%) negative agreement, 82% (95% CI, 72% to 90%) positive agreement, 92% sensitivity, and 96% specificity. No serious adverse events were reported for macimorelin. CONCLUSIONS: Oral macimorelin is a simple, well-tolerated, reproducible, and safe diagnostic test for AGHD with accuracy comparable to that of the ITT. A GH cutoff of 5.1 ng/mL for the macimorelin test provides an excellent balance between sensitivity and specificity.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1567,28683750,BMC medicine,Use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests by community health workers in Afghanistan: cluster randomised trial,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends parasitological diagnosis of malaria before treatment, but use of malaria rapid diagnostic tests (mRDTs) by community health workers (CHWs) has not been fully tested within health services in south and central Asia. mRDTs could allow CHWs to diagnose malaria accurately, improving treatment of febrile illness. METHODS: A cluster randomised trial in community health services was undertaken in Afghanistan. The primary outcome was the proportion of suspected malaria cases correctly treated for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed malaria and PCR negative cases receiving no antimalarial drugs measured at the level of the patient. CHWs from 22 clusters (clinics) received standard training on clinical diagnosis and treatment of malaria; 11 clusters randomised to the intervention arm received additional training and were provided with mRDTs. CHWs enrolled cases of suspected malaria, and the mRDT results and treatments were compared to blind-read PCR diagnosis. RESULTS: In total, 256 CHWs enrolled 2400 patients with 2154 (89.8%) evaluated. In the intervention arm, 75.3% (828/1099) were treated appropriately vs. 17.5% (185/1055) in the control arm (cluster adjusted risk ratio: 3.72, 95% confidence interval 2.40-5.77; p < 0.001). In the control arm, 85.9% (164/191) with confirmed Plasmodium vivax received chloroquine compared to 45.1% (70/155) in the intervention arm (p < 0.001). Overuse of chloroquine in the control arm resulted in 87.6% (813/928) of those with no malaria (PCR negative) being treated vs. 10.0% (95/947) in the intervention arm, p < 0.001. In the intervention arm, 71.4% (30/42) of patients with P. falciparum did not receive artemisinin-based combination therapy, partly because operational sensitivity of the RDTs was low (53.2%, 38.1-67.9). There was high concordance between recorded RDT result and CHW prescription decisions: 826/950 (87.0%) with a negative test were not prescribed an antimalarial. Co-trimoxazole was prescribed to 62.7% of malaria negative patients in the intervention arm and 15.0% in the control arm. CONCLUSIONS: While introducing mRDT reduced overuse of antimalarials, this action came with risks that need to be considered before use at scale: an appreciable proportion of malaria cases will be missed by those using current mRDTs. Higher sensitivity tests could be used to detect all cases. Overtreatment with antimalarial drugs in the control arm was replaced with increased antibiotic prescription in the intervention arm, resulting in a probable overuse of antibiotics.

1568,14991240,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,Effects of partial volume correction on discrimination between very early Alzheimer's dementia and controls using brain perfusion SPECT,"We assessed the accuracy of brain perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in discriminating between patients with probable Alzheimer's disease (AD) at the very early stage and age-matched controls before and after partial volume correction (PVC). Three-dimensional MRI was used for PVC. We randomly divided the subjects into two groups. The first group, comprising 30 patients and 30 healthy volunteers, was used to identify the brain area with the most significant decrease in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients compared with normal controls based on the voxel-based analysis of a group comparison. The second group, comprising 31 patients and 31 healthy volunteers, was used to study the improvement in diagnostic accuracy provided by PVC. A Z score map for a SPECT image of a subject was obtained by comparison with mean and standard deviation SPECT images of the healthy volunteers for each voxel after anatomical standardization and voxel normalization to global mean or cerebellar values using the following equation: Z score = ([control mean]-[individual value] )/(control SD). Analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves for a Z score discriminating AD and controls in the posterior cingulate gyrus, where a significant decrease in rCBF was identified in the first group, showed that the PVC significantly enhanced the accuracy of the SPECT diagnosis of very early AD from 73.9% to 83.7% with global mean normalization. The PVC mildly enhanced the accuracy from 73.1% to 76.3% with cerebellar normalization. This result suggests that early diagnosis of AD requires PVC in a SPECT study.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

These findings suggest the mSAAST to be a useful adjunctive indicator of persons at risk of developing excessive consumption of alcohol. It is probable that the usefulness of the mSAAST extends beyond narcotic-dependent populations and may be of value in identifying the potential for excessive alcohol consumption in other populations.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1570,25512674,Sexually transmitted infections,The SPORTSMART study: a pilot randomised controlled trial of sexually transmitted infection screening interventions targeting men in football club settings,"BACKGROUND: Uptake of chlamydia screening by men in England has been substantially lower than by women. Non-traditional settings such as sports clubs offer opportunities to widen access. Involving people who are not medically trained to promote screening could optimise acceptability. METHODS: We developed two interventions to explore the acceptability and feasibility of urine-based sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening interventions targeting men in football clubs. We tested these interventions in a pilot cluster randomised control trial. Six clubs were randomly allocated, two to each of three trial arms: team captain-led and poster STI screening promotion; sexual health adviser-led and poster STI screening promotion; and poster-only STI screening promotion (control/comparator). Primary outcome was test uptake. RESULTS: Across the three arms, 153 men participated in the trial and 90 accepted the offer of screening (59%, 95% CI 35% to 79%). Acceptance rates were broadly comparable across the arms: captain-led: 28/56 (50%); health professional-led: 31/46 (67%); and control: 31/51 (61%). However, rates varied appreciably by club, precluding formal comparison of arms. No infections were identified. Process evaluation confirmed that interventions were delivered in a standardised way but the control arm was unintentionally 'enhanced' by some team captains actively publicising screening events. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with other UK-based community screening models, uptake was high but gaining access to clubs was not always easy. Use of sexual health advisers and team captains to promote screening did not appear to confer additional benefit over a poster-promoted approach. Although the interventions show potential, the broader implications of this strategy for UK male STI screening policy require further investigation.",CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS| GONORRHOEA| INTERVENTION STUDIES| MEN| SCREENING,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1571,38212353,Scientific reports,"An exploratory metabolomic comparison of participants with fast or absent functional progression from 2CARE, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in Huntington's disease","Huntington's disease (HD) is increasingly recognized for diverse pathology outside of the nervous system. To describe the biology of HD in relation to functional progression, we previously analyzed the plasma and CSF metabolome in a cross-sectional study of participants who had various degrees of functional impairment. Here, we carried out an exploratory study in plasma from HD individuals over a 3-year time frame to assess whether differences exist between those with fast or absent clinical progression. There were more differences in circulating metabolite levels for fast progressors compared to absent progressors (111 vs 20, nominal p < 0.05). All metabolite changes in faster progressors were decreases, whereas some metabolite concentrations increased in absent progressors. Many of the metabolite levels that decreased in the fast progressors were higher at Screening compared to absent progressors but ended up lower by Year 3. Changes in faster progression suggest greater oxidative stress and inflammation (kynurenine, diacylglycerides, cysteine), disturbances in nitric oxide and urea metabolism (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, GABR), lower polyamines (putrescine and spermine), elevated glucose, and deficient AMPK signaling. Metabolomic differences between fast and absent progressors suggest the possibility of predicting functional decline in HD, and possibly delaying it with interventions to augment arginine, polyamines, and glucose regulation.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1572,19330596,Brain injury,Sensitivity and specificity of the 3-item memory test in the assessment of post traumatic amnesia,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the type of stimulus (pictures or words) and the method of reproduction (free recall or recognition after a short or a long delay) affect the sensitivity and specificity of a 3-item memory test in the assessment of post traumatic amnesia (PTA). METHODS: Daily testing was performed in 64 consecutively admitted traumatic brain injured patients, 22 orthopedically injured patients and 26 healthy controls until criteria for resolution of PTA were reached. Subjects were randomly assigned to a test with visual or verbal stimuli. Short delay reproduction was tested after an interval of 3-5 minutes, long delay reproduction was tested after 24 hours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated over the first 4 test days. RESULTS: The 3-word test showed higher sensitivity than the 3-picture test, while specificity of the two tests was equally high. Free recall was a more effortful task than recognition for both patients and controls. In patients, a longer delay between registration and recall resulted in a significant decrease in the number of items reproduced. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of PTA is best assessed with a memory test that incorporates the free recall of words after a long delay.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1573,31423955,Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy,I am a total failure: associations between beliefs and anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease with poor mental quality of life,"BACKGROUND: According to cognitive behavioural theory, cognitive factors (i.e. underlying general dysfunctional beliefs and (situation) specific illness beliefs) are theorized to lead to outcomes like anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, general dysfunctional beliefs are generally not tackled directly in short-term-therapy. AIMS: The goal of the present study was to investigate the associations of general versus specific illness beliefs on anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychiatric disorders among a subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with poor mental quality of life (QoL). METHOD: This study concerns cross-sectional data, collected at baseline from a randomized clinical trial. One hundred and eighteen patients, recruited at four Dutch hospitals, with poor QoL (score ≤23 on the mental health subscale of the Short-Form 36-item Health-Survey; SF-36) were included. General dysfunctional beliefs were measured by the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), specific illness beliefs by the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R), anxiety and depressive symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychiatric disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders (SCID-I). RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed associations between the level of anxiety and/or depression and general dysfunctional beliefs and four specific illness beliefs (consequences, personal control, emotional representations and treatment control). Among patients with IBD with psychiatric disorders, only the DAS was significantly associated with anxiety and depression (DAS added to IPQ-R and IPQ-R added to DAS). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological interventions may have to target general dysfunctional beliefs of patients with IBD with co-morbid psychiatric disorders to be effective. These patients with IBD are especially in need of psychological treatment.",anxiety| depression| dysfunctional beliefs| illness beliefs| inflammatory bowel disease| psychiatric disorders,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1574,36598770,JAMA psychiatry,Effect of Technology-Enhanced Screening in Addition to Standard Targeted Clinician Education on the Duration of Untreated Psychosis: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is essential to improving outcomes for people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Current US approaches are insufficient to reduce DUP to international standards of less than 90 days. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether population-based electronic screening in addition to standard targeted clinician education increases early detection of psychosis and decreases DUP, compared with clinician education alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial included individuals aged 12 to 30 years presenting for services between March 2015 and September 2017 at participating sites that included community mental health clinics and school support and special education services. Eligible participants were referred to the Early Diagnosis and Preventative Treatment (EDAPT) Clinic. Data analyses were performed in September and October 2019 for the primary and secondary analyses, with the exploratory subgroup analyses completed in May 2021. INTERVENTIONS: All sites in both groups received targeted education about early psychosis for health care professionals. In the active screening group, clients also completed the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief using tablets at intake; referrals were based on those scores and clinical judgment. In the group receiving treatment as usual (TAU), referrals were based on clinical judgment alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included DUP, defined as the period from full psychosis onset to the date of the EDAPT diagnostic telephone interview, and the number of individuals identified with FEP or a psychosis spectrum disorder. Exploratory analyses examined differences by site type, completion rates between conditions, and days from service entry to telephone interview. RESULTS: Twenty-four sites agreed to participate, and 12 sites were randomized to either the active screening or TAU group. However, only 10 community clinics and 4 school sites were able to fully implement population screening and were included in the final analysis. The total potentially eligible population size within each study group was similar, with 2432 individuals entering at active screening group sites and 2455 at TAU group sites. A total of 303 diagnostic telephone interviews were completed (178 [58.7%] female individuals; mean [SD] age, 17.09 years [4.57]). Active screening sites reported a significantly higher detection rate of psychosis spectrum disorders (136 cases [5.6%], relative to 65 [2.6%]; P < .001) and referred a higher proportion of individuals with FEP and DUP less than 90 days (13 cases, relative to 4; odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.93; P = .03). There was no difference in mean (SD) DUP between groups (active screening group, 239.0 days [207.4]; TAU group 262.3 days [170.2]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster trial, population-based technology-enhanced screening across community settings detected more than twice as many individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders compared with clinical judgment alone but did not reduce DUP. Screening could identify people undetected in US mental health services. Significant DUP reduction may require interventions to reduce time to the first mental health contact.

1575,18316457,Journal of medical ethics,Participation in dementia research: rates and correlates of capacity to give informed consent,"BACKGROUND: Many people participating in dementia research may lack capacity to give informed consent and the relationship between cognitive function and capacity remains unclear. Recent changes in the law reinforce the need for robust and reproducible methods of assessing capacity when recruiting people for research. AIMS: To identify numbers of capacitous participants in a pragmatic randomised trial of dementia treatment; to assess characteristics associated with capacity; to describe a legally acceptable consent process for research. METHODS: As part of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba for mild-moderate dementia, we used a consenting algorithm that met the requirements of existing case law and the exigencies of the new Mental Capacity Act. We decided who had capacity to give informed consent for participation in the trial using this algorithm and sought predictors of capacity. RESULTS: Most participants (76%) with mild-moderate dementia in this trial were unable to give informed consent according to the legal criteria. When adjusted for confounding, the Mini Mental State examination did not predict the presence of capacity. CONCLUSION: Cognitive testing alone is insufficient to assess the presence of capacity. Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of the challenging processes regarding capacity assessment. We outline a procedure which we believe meets the ethical and legal requirements.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

This article provides an overview of and results to date from the REVEAL study, a multisite randomized clinical trial (n = 162) examining the impact of a genetic risk assessment program, including apolipoprotein E genotype disclosure, for adult children of people with Alzheimer's disease. The study's rationale and procedures are described, including the generation of numerical lifetime risk curves for use in the education and counseling protocol. Findings are summarized across numerous study questions, including (1) who seeks genetic risk assessment and why, (2) how apolipoprotein E results affect risk perceptions, (3) the psychological impact of genetic risk assessment, and (4) how risk information affects participants' subsequent health and insurance behaviors.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
1577,22475083,Implementation science : IS,The effect of watchful waiting compared to immediate test ordering instructions on general practitioners' blood test ordering behaviour for patients with unexplained complaints; a randomized clinical trial (ISRCTN55755886),"BACKGROUND: Immediate blood testing for patients presenting with unexplained complaints in family practice is superfluous from a diagnostic point of view. However, many general pracitioners (GPs) order tests immediately. Watchful waiting reduces the number of patients to be tested and the number of false-positive results. The objectives of this study are: to determine the feasibility of watchful waiting compared to immediate test ordering; to determine if a special quality improvement strategy can improve this feasibility; and to determine if watchful waiting leads to testing at a later time. METHODS: The study is a cluster-randomized clinical trial with three groups, on blood test ordering strategies in patients with unexplained complaints. GPs in group one were instructed to order tests immediately and GPs in group two to apply a watchful waiting approach. GPs in group three received the same instruction as group two, but they were supported by a systematically designed quality improvement strategy. A total of 498 patients with unexplained complaints from 63 practices of Dutch GPs participated. We measured: the percentage of patients for whom tests were ordered and number of tests ordered at the first consultation; performance on the strategy's performance objectives (i.e., ordering fewer tests and specific communication skills); the number of tests ordered after four weeks; and GP and patient characteristics. RESULTS: Immediate test ordering proved feasible in 92% of the patients; watchful waiting in 86% and 84%, respectively, for groups two and three. The two watchful waiting groups did not differ significantly in the achievement of any of the performance objectives. Of the patients who returned after four weeks, none from group one and six from the two watchful waiting groups had tests ordered for them. CONCLUSIONS: Watchful waiting is a feasible approach. It does not lead to testing immediately afterwards. Furthermore, watchful waiting was not improved by the quality improvement strategy.

To evaluate the relationship between these two disorders, subject responses to inhalation of a 35% CO2 and 65% O2 mixture were assessed.	Twenty-three patients with panic disorder, 23 with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 12 with both obsessive-compulsive and panic disorder, and 23 healthy comparison subjects were given a single vital capacity inhalation of 35% CO2 and 65% O2 or a placebo mixture of compressed air. A double-blind, random, crossover design was used.	Patients with panic disorder and patients with both panic disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder showed similar strong anxiogenic reactions to 35% CO2; while patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder alone did not differ from comparison subjects.	These results confirm that obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are two distinct syndromes and that patients with these disorders have different sensitivity to CO2 inhalation.",,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

AIMS: To investigate whether performing a (123)I-ioflupane injection ((123)I-FP-CIT also called DaTSCAN™) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan in patients with possible DLB would lead to a more certain diagnosis (probable DLB or non-DLB dementia). METHOD: We randomised 187 patients with possible DLB 2:1 to have a scan or not (control group). The outcome measure was a change in diagnosis to probable DLB or non-DLB. RESULTS: There were 56 controls and 114 scanned patients, of whom 43% had an abnormal scan. More patients in the imaging group had a change in diagnosis compared with controls at 8 and 24 weeks (61% (n = 70) v. 4% (n = 2) and 71% (n = 77) v. 16% (n = 9); both P<0.0001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard transaxial section displays and 3D-SSP z-score maps obtained after administration of Tc-99m ECD or I-123 IMP were randomly interpreted in 315 patients who visited initially to the cognitive disorder clinic (age 46-88 years; 162 women, 153 men). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and 178 patients were diagnosed with other disorders and age-associated cognitive decline. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy calculated using standard transaxial display were 61%, 70%, 61%, 70%, and 66%, respectively, and using the 3D-SSP z-score map were 90%, 74%, 73%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. Particularly, the sensitivity value improved in mild cases compared with severe cases using 3D-SSP. Diagnostic performance with 3D-SSP was superior in both mild dementia (Az = 0.64 [section] vs 0.81 [3D-SSP], P = 0.001) and severe dementia (Az = 0.75 [section] vs 0.90 [3D-SSP], P = 0.002).
