1,11153807,The Journal of clinical psychiatry,An ever-increasing pharmacopoeia for the management of patients with bipolar disorder.,"Bipolar disorder is a recurrent and relapsing mood disorder characterized by cycles of depression and mania. This article addresses the treatment of patients with bipolar mania, which remains one of the most difficult challenges facing clinicians. Patients require safe and effective therapeutic approaches for acute episodes of mania and depression, as well as chronic prophylaxis against future episodes. Monotherapeutic approaches are rarely effective, and combination approaches are associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Lithium is the only agent currently approved for the treatment of both acute episodes of mania and maintenance therapy; however, it is associated with a relatively poor response rate, high relapse rate, and less-than-optimal side effect profile. Other recent approaches have included several anticonvulsant agents, as well as conventional and atypical antipsychotic agents.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
2,16186198,The journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law,Pathological lying revisited.,"Although pathological lying was first described in the medical literature over 100 years ago, it remains a poorly understood concept. Psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition, even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times. The impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context. In this article, the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions. While providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context, the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

How do these impact on understanding the patient in front of us? What do they mean for the busy clinician in clinic? We outline some of the recent findings in neuroimaging research of schizophrenia and consider their potential application in clinical practice.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
4,28118304,Current opinion in neurology,Cerebellar mutism syndrome: cause and rehabilitation.,"Mutism of cerebellar origin may occur in the context of various causes but is most frequent in children after resection of a large midline cerebellar tumour. In this review, the endeavour to reach a consensus on name and definition of postoperative mutism of cerebellar origin and associated symptoms is highlighted. In addition, progress in understanding of cause and risk factors for the syndrome is discussed as well as the rehabilitation issues.	Consensus on the term cerebellar mutism syndrome (CMS) has been reached. The exact pathogenesis of CMS remains unclear. Recently, attention was drawn to the hypothesis that thermal injury might be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of CMS. Diffusion tensor imaging tractography was found to visualize the damage to relevant pathways that are associated with persistent impairments after recovery of CMS. There is still no established treatment for CMS to date.	By reaching a consensus on terminology and description of CMS, a firm basis has been created for future research. The pathogenesis of CMS seems multifactorial and important risk factors have been found. However, CMS cannot be effectively prevented yet and no established or specific treatment is available, apart from very general rehabilitation and cognitive interventions.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
5,12680793,Technology in cancer research & treatment,Stereotactic radiosurgery for benign neoplasms.,"Over the last decade, the use of stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) for the treatment of intracranial lesions has grown significantly. In addition to malignant brain tumors and vascular malformations, benign tumors have also been treated with SRS. Although surgical resection has long been considered the gold standard in the management of such benign lesions, the outcomes of SRS in various benign neoplasms appears to be comparable. In this review, we will examine the literature as it pertains to the treatment of benign brain tumors with SRS. Of particular note, we will examine the results of SRS in acoustic neuromas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and other benign tumors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
6,26450593,"The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",Epigenetic Basis of Mental Illness.,"Psychiatric disorders are complex multifactorial illnesses involving chronic alterations in neural circuit structure and function as well as likely abnormalities in glial cells. While genetic factors are important in the etiology of most mental disorders, the relatively high rates of discordance among identical twins, particularly for depression and other stress-related syndromes, clearly indicate the importance of additional mechanisms. Environmental factors such as stress are known to play a role in the onset of these illnesses. Exposure to such environmental insults induces stable changes in gene expression, neural circuit function, and ultimately behavior, and these maladaptations appear distinct between developmental versus adult exposures. Increasing evidence indicates that these sustained abnormalities are maintained by epigenetic modifications in specific brain regions. Indeed, transcriptional dysregulation and the aberrant epigenetic regulation that underlies this dysregulation is a unifying theme in psychiatric disorders. Here, we provide a progress report of epigenetic studies of the three major psychiatric syndromes, depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We review the literature derived from animal models of these disorders as well as from studies of postmortem brain tissue from human patients. While epigenetic studies of mental illness remain at early stages, understanding how environmental factors recruit the epigenetic machinery within specific brain regions to cause lasting changes in disease susceptibility and pathophysiology is revealing new insight into the etiology and treatment of these conditions.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
7,37132490,Biomeditsinskaia khimiia,Features of oxidative stress in alcoholism.,"The review considers molecular mechanisms underlying formation and development of oxidative stress (OS) in patients with alcohol dependence. The major attention is paid to the effects of ethanol and its metabolite acetaldehyde associated with additional sources of generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in response to exogenous ethanol. The own results of studies of the in vitro effect of ethanol and acetaldehyde on the concentration of peripheral OS markers - products of oxidative modification of proteins (protein carbonyls), lipids (lipid peroxidation products), DNA (8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, 8-OHdG) in blood plasma are presented. The changes in these parameters and the activity of antioxidant enzymes (SOD, catalase) in patients with alcohol dependence were analyzed. Own and literature data indicate that at a certain stage of the disease OS can play a protective rather than pathogenic role in the body.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
8,30868468,Acta neurologica Belgica,The current and emerging therapeutic approaches in drug-resistant epilepsy management.,"Epilepsy is a neurologic disorder consisting of recurrent spontaneous seizures. Antiepileptic drugs administration is the most commonly used therapeutic strategy in the management of epilepsy. However, 20-30% of epilepsy patients have seizure episodes that are not controlled by these medicines (drug-resistant epilepsy). The management of drug-resistant epilepsy, especially in the children, is challenging and can cause economic and social problems, and lower the patients' quality of life, cognition, and mood. Several therapeutic approaches for drug-resistant epilepsy are available including surgical methods, neurostimulation treatments, and diet therapies which lead to diminishing the epileptic seizures. An increasing number of novel and potential therapeutic approaches such as gene therapy, gene editing, cell therapy, exosome therapy, and molecular network targeting have also been explored. The present study is aimed to review these current and emerging therapeutic approaches for drug-resistant epilepsy.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

This article reviews these noncognitive symptoms from a behavioral point of view and suggests that both operant and associative conditioning principles might apply. A central feature underlying these approaches is a detailed, specific description of the behavior.

10,19961324,Annual review of entomology,Ekbom syndrome: the challenge of 'invisible bug' infestations.,"Ekbom Syndrome is synonymous with delusory parasitosis, a belief that one's body is infested by invisible bugs. Persons suffering from this syndrome often claim to feel dermal sensations and to visualize the bugs, although no one else can see them. Ekbom Syndrome is a delusional condition; it is intractable and cannot be corrected by argument or evidence. Ekbom Syndrome sufferers exhibit a range of predictable behaviors in their attempts to eliminate their infestations, including seeking identifications and treatment from physicians and entomologists. Frequently they also experience comorbid psychological conditions. Because this is a delusional affliction, successful treatment typically requires neuroleptic medications, necessitating intervention by medical professionals.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
11,20562639,The journal of ECT,Electrode placement in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): A review of the literature.,"Electrode placement in electroconvulsive therapy affects both the efficacy and adverse cognitive effect profile of the treatment. For many years, 2 placements, bitemporal (also referred to as 'bifrontotemporal' or simply 'bilateral') and right unilateral, were the principal placements in widespread clinical use. More recently, bifrontal placement has joined their ranks as a commonly used placement. In this article, we review the evidence base for the efficacy and safety of each of these electrode placements for the indication of depression, describe another novel placement, and then draw conclusions from this available evidence base, pointing out areas in need of further study.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

14,17565028,Chest,Sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes.,"The latest edition of The International Classification of Sleep Disorders: Diagnostic and Coding Manual subsumes a broad range of disorders under the heading 'Sleep Related Hypoventilation/Hypoxemic Syndromes.' Some are quite common, such as COPD with worsening gas exchange during sleep; while some are exceedingly rare, such as congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. All share the attribute of abnormal gas exchange that worsens, or may only be present, during sleep. The sleep state, the sleeping posture, and the circadian rhythm driving sleep all may affect respiration by altering control of breathing and/or pulmonary mechanics. These changes are largely inconsequential in the normal individual but interact with respiratory, neurologic, or neuromuscular disease to manifest as the sleep-related hypoventilation/hypoxemic syndromes. In addition to optimal treatment of the underlying disorder (when known and when possible), treatment usually involves nocturnal ventilatory support that is now most commonly provided by noninvasive positive pressure ventilation.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
15,21171977,Orphanet J Rare Dis,Huntington's disease: a clinical review,"Huntington disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system characterized by unwanted choreatic movements, behavioral and psychiatric disturbances and dementia. Prevalence in the Caucasian population is estimated at 1/10,000-1/20,000. Mean age at onset of symptoms is 30-50 years. In some cases symptoms start before the age of 20 years with behavior disturbances and learning difficulties at school (Juvenile Huntington's disease; JHD). The classic sign is chorea that gradually spreads to all muscles. All psychomotor processes become severely retarded. Patients experience psychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline. HD is an autosomal dominant inherited disease caused by an elongated CAG repeat (36 repeats or more) on the short arm of chromosome 4p16.3 in the Huntingtine gene. The longer the CAG repeat, the earlier the onset of disease. In cases of JHD the repeat often exceeds 55. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and signs in an individual with a parent with proven HD, and is confirmed by DNA determination. Pre-manifest diagnosis should only be performed by multidisciplinary teams in healthy at-risk adult individuals who want to know whether they carry the mutation or not. Differential diagnoses include other causes of chorea including general internal disorders or iatrogenic disorders. Phenocopies (clinically diagnosed cases of HD without the genetic mutation) are observed. Prenatal diagnosis is possible by chorionic villus sampling or amniocentesis. Preimplantation diagnosis with in vitro fertilization is offered in several countries. There is no cure. Management should be multidisciplinary and is based on treating symptoms with a view to improving quality of life. Chorea is treated with dopamine receptor blocking or depleting agents. Medication and non-medical care for depression and aggressive behavior may be required. The progression of the disease leads to a complete dependency in daily life, which results in patients requiring full-time care, and finally death. The most common cause of death is pneumonia, followed by suicide.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

An objective method of measurement like this is most valuable for follow-up studies and the surveillance of therapeutic efficacy. The method of recording short, medium, and long latency reflexes in leg muscles after a sudden tilt of a movable platform toe-up is not only totally atraumatic and fast, but more importantly it gives significant hints towards the possible site of a central lesion in the sensory-motor system.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
17,21870315,Fortschritte der Neurologie-Psychiatrie,[Forensic-psychiatric assessment of pedophilia].,"The present paper illustrates the approach of a forensic psychiatric expert witness regarding the assessment of pedophilia. In a first step it is inevitable to differentiate if the defendant is suffering from pedophilia or if the alleged crime might have been committed because of other motivations (antisociality, sexual activity as redirection, impulsivity). A sound diagnostic assessment is indispendable for this task. In a second step the level of severity needs to be gauged in order to clarify whether the requirement of the entry criteria of §§ 20, 21 of the German penal code are fulfilled. In a third step, significant impairments of self-control mechanisms need to be elucidated. The present article reviews indicators of such impairments regarding pedophilia. With respect to a mandatory treatment order (§ 63 German penal code) or preventive detention (§ 66 German penal code) the legal prognosis of the defendant needs to be considered. The present paper gives an overview of the current state of risk assessment research and discusses the transfer to an individual prognosis critically.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
18,28735440,Current oncology reports,New Hypofractionation Radiation Strategies for Glioblastoma.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and lethal primary brain tumor in adults, with a median survival of less than 2 years despite the standard of care treatment of 6 weeks of chemoradiotherapy. We review the data investigating hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) in the treatment of newly diagnosed GBM.	Investigators have explored alternative radiotherapy strategies that shorten treatment duration with the goal of similar or improved survival while minimizing toxicity. HFRT over 1-3 weeks is already a standard of care for patients with advanced age or poor performance status. For young patients with good performance status, HFRT holds the promise of radiobiologically escalating the dose and potentially improving local control while maintaining quality of life. Through the use of shorter radiotherapy fractionation regimens coupled with novel systemic agents, improved outcomes for patients with GBM may be achieved.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
19,10883547,International journal of group psychotherapy,Integrating group psychotherapy and 12-step work: a collaborative approach.,"Group therapists can expect to treat an increasing number of patients who are active in a 12-step program or other addiction-related self-help groups. The value of simultaneous participation in these two modalities has been recognized; 12-step work supports abstinence necessary for the focus on emotional growth in psychotherapy. However, mere simultaneous participation in the two modalities fails to incorporate the benefits of a collaborative relationship where both modalities are used to support both abstinence and emotional growth. The conjoint approach to group and individual treatment is used to (a) argue for the possibility of a collaborative relationship between psychotherapy and a patient's 12-step work, (b) understand the benefits and challenges to collaboration, and (c) provide guidelines for how to work collaboratively with a 12-step program. Illustrations are provided of typical issues raised by this type of collaborative relationship.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
20,18514148,L'Encephale,[Folie à deux: update of an old concept regarding two cases].,"Folie à deux or induced delusional disorder is a rare mental disorder. It was initially described by the French Lasègue and Falret in 1877. Two subjects, who live in a close relationship, in isolation, share delusional ideas based on the same themes. Various classifications exist. Its epidemiology remains unclear, because most of the data have been extrapolated from case reports.	In this paper, we describe and comment two cases of shared paranoid disorder: in the first case report, a husband shares the paranoiac delusion of his wife; the second case report describes a shared paranoid disorder between a schizophrenic daughter and her mother.	A review of the existing literature is also presented. Some clinical characteristics arise, such as frequent mother-daughter associations and diagnosis of schizophrenia in inducing subject. Particular social and psychopathological conditions for the occurrence of a shared delusional disorder are described, such as personality traits and genetic influences. This article also reviews some forensic issues, which may be of importance, since this disorder is underdiagnosed. Data concerning the principles of its treatment are sparse, but most authors consider that the separation of the two subjects has to be the basis of any intervention. The inducing subject has to be treated with specific medical interventions, including the prescription of antipsychotics. Sometimes, the separation is enough to eliminate the delusional ideas from the induced subject, who, according to the ICD-10 and DSM-IV, is the only one to meet the criteria for shared delusional disorder. The case reports are discussed in light of the review, and some propositions for their treatment are made.	As shared delusional disorder is a rare disease, only few data exist on its pathophysiology and mechanisms, and controlled studies are needed in order to understand its specific implications better and to define recommendations for its management.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

23,12817549,American journal of psychotherapy,Imprisoned royalty: defensive failure and reconstitution on an inpatient unit.,"Treatment of schizophrenic patients in an inpatient setting has become ever-more challenging over time. Patients move in and out of hospital systems quickly, and the severity of patients' illnesses during their hospital stay makes the experience chaotic and intense. This paper offers a model for understanding psychotic patients' experiences on an inpatient unit, and for effectively working with them in this setting. I have drawn on a parallel in film, that of 'The Madness of King George,' to help illustrate the concept of the hospitalized schizophrenic patient as imprisoned royalty. Through this metaphor, I explore the process of defensive breakdown and repair in psychosis, as it occurs in the hospital setting. I examine the relationships between patients, clinicians, and aspects of the hospital, and review some of the common dilemmas in this type of treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
24,20012471,Journal of gambling studies,The impacts of gaming expansion on economic growth: a theoretical reconsideration.,"This paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming, which exports gambling services largely to non-residents. Both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy. However, an over-expansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income. If this situation persists, it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur. As a highly profitable sector, casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in non-gaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created. The gaming-dominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path, and will become less susceptible to business cycles. Indeed, economic experiences in the world's major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification. We believe that after the current global crisis fades away, economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
25,16195185,Brain injury,Consensus guidelines on screening for hypopituitarism following traumatic brain injury.,"The goal of this consensus statement is to increase awareness among endocrinologists and physicians treating patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) of the incidence and risks of hypopituitarism among patients with TBI.	TBI poses significant risk to the pituitary gland, leading to elevated risks of diabetes, hypopituitarism and other endocrinopathies. Signs and symptoms associated with hypopituitarism often mimic the sequellae of TBI, although the severity of symptoms is not necessarily related to the severity of the injury. Patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may benefit both physically and psychologically from appropriate hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Participants at this unique consensus meeting attempted to define and spearhead an approach to increase awareness of the risks of TBI-induced endocrinopathies, in particular growth hormone deficiency (GHD), and to outline necessary and practical objectives for managing this condition.	Systematic screening of pituitary function is recommended for all patients with moderate-to-severe TBI at risk of developing pituitary deficits. Patients with hypopituitarism benefit from appropriate hormonal replacement and prospects for rehabilitation of patients with TBI-induced hypopituitarism may be enhanced by appropriate HRT. Further exploration of this possibility requires: (1) active collaboration between divisions of endocrinology and rehabilitation at the local level to perform a screening of pituitary function in patients after TBI, (2) creation of a consultancy service by endocrine societies for use by rehabilitation centres, (3) development of continuing medical education (CME) programmes that can be offered as crossover training to the physicians who manage the care of patients with TBIs, (4) targeting of patient organizations with educational information for dissemination to patients and their families, (5) continued efforts to more clearly define the population at greatest risk of TBI-induced hypopituitarism and (6) monitor results of efficacy studies as they become available to evaluate whether and how much replacement therapy can improve the symptoms of individuals with TBI-induced hypopituitarism.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
26,9409103,J Am Optom Assoc,Eye signs and tic disorders: Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome,"BACKGROUND: Eye tics are among the most common manifested symptoms of tic disorders, including Gilles de la Tourette's syndrome (GTS). METHODS: A review of medical literature or ocular signs and symptoms of tic disorders was conducted. RESULTS: Tic disorders are characterized by repetitive and often disabling movements that primarily involve the eyes, face, neck, and voice apparatus. In addition, patients with tics may have eye problems related to medications used to control tics. Some eye signs are atypical in tic disorders and their presence may suggest alternate diagnoses. CONCLUSION: Eye tics can be disabling and a optometrist should be familiar with ocular manifestations of tics and ocular dysfunction related to tic treatment, and also be aware of other neurologic conditions confused with tics.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
27,25837613,Professioni infermieristiche,[The use of expressive writing in the course of care for cancer patients to reduce emotional distress: analysis of the literature].,"The emotional distress represents one of the symptoms most frequently reported in the cancer patient in therapy, increasing the risk of developing a disease depressive. Through the analysis of the literature we want to assess whether the use of expressive writing on cancer patients in their care pathway compared to the use of writing neutral reduces emotional distress.	The bibliographic search was conducted using the databases CINAHL, PubMed, Cochrane Library and PsycInfo.	The results of research conducted on 7 randomized controlled trials, including 3 pilot studies have shown after expressive writing sessions (experimental group) versus neutral writing (control group) a significant reduction in distress in the experimental group early stages of cancer (p = 0,0183); in patients with a diagnosis of metastatic assigned to the group expressive writing there was a statistically significant relevance in the reduction of mood disorders (p = 0,03).Were determined statistically significant group differences also with respect to some measure on the quality of sleep (p = 0,04). The expressive writing did not produce significant reductions in psychological distress and improvements in physical health (p > 0,20) in patients diagnosed with metastatic disease of long duration and, in the palliative care there have been results of feasibility for poor adherence at follow-up.	From the results it is evident that the strategies of expressive writing improves the management of the disease, reduce the physical and psychological symptoms related to the tumor while reducing the emotional distress in patients at an early stage of the disease.

28,36203173,BMC medical ethics,Flaws in advance directives that request withdrawing assisted feeding in late-stage dementia may cause premature or prolonged dying.,"The terminal illness of late-stage (advanced) Alzheimer's and related dementias is progressively cruel, burdensome, and can last years if caregivers assist oral feeding and hydrating. Options to avoid prolonged dying are limited since advanced dementia patients cannot qualify for Medical Aid in Dying. Physicians and judges can insist on clear and convincing evidence that the patient wants to die-which many advance directives cannot provide. Proxies/agents' substituted judgment may not be concordant with patients' requests. While advance directives can be patients' last resort to attain a peaceful and timely dying consistent with their lifelong values, success depends on their being effective and acceptable. A single flaw can provide opponents justification to refuse the directive's requests to cease assisted feeding.	This article considers 24 common advance directive flaws in four categories. Process flaws focus on how patients express their end-of-life wishes. Content flaws reflect drafters' selection of conditions and interventions, and how they are described. Inherent flaws can make advance directives unacceptable to authorities concerned about premature dying. Strategies are needed to compel physicians to write needed orders and to prevent third parties from sabotaging these orders after they are  implemented. The article includes excerpts from 'dementia-specific' directives or supplements that exemplify each flaw-mostly from the US and Europe. No directive critiqued here included an effective strategy to resolve this long-debated bioethical conflict: the past directive requests 'Cease assisted feeding' but the incapacitated patient apparently expresses the desire to 'Continue assisted feeding.' Some opponents to the controversial request, cease assisted feeding, use this conflict as a conceptual wedge to practice hard paternalism. This article proposes a protocol to prevent this conflict from emerging. These strategies may prevent authorities from requiring patients to fulfill authorities' additional clinical criteria as a prerequisite to honor the requests in patients directives.	This critique of flaws may serve as a guide to drafting and to selecting effective and acceptable advance directives for dementia. It also poses several bioethical and clinical questions to those in authority: Does your paternalistic refusal to honor patients' wishes respect their self-determination? Protect vulnerable patients from harm? Force patients to endure prolonged suffering? Violate the principles of bioethics? Violate the very foundation of patient-centered care?",Non-systematic-review,1,0
29,36152383,Epilepsy Behav,Effects of psychiatric comorbidities in persons with epilepsy on recurrent emergency department visits,"BACKGROUND: Coexisting mental health disorders in persons with epilepsy present as substantial burdens to patients and healthcare systems. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, we reviewed 160 patients presenting to a safety net hospital Emergency Department (ED) with seizures to investigate whether differences in clinical workup, follow-ups, and ED visit recurrence existed between epilepsy patients with epilepsy with and without a coexisting psychiatric disorder. RESULTS: Patients with epilepsy with a psychiatric comorbidity had more subsequent ED visits (45 % vs 26 %, p = 0.01) and fewer outpatient follow-up opportunities (74 % vs 87 %, p = 0.042) compared to patients with epilepsy without psychiatric comorbidities, highlighting a healthcare gap that needs to be addressed. INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest a need for ED providers to shift their clinical practice in favor of offering more outpatient follow-up opportunities, to ensure long-term management of seizures in patients with epilepsy with comorbid psychiatric disorders.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
30,32892962,Seminars in pediatric neurology,Treatment of Folate Metabolism Abnormalities in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder that currently has no approved medical therapy to address core symptoms or underling pathophysiological processes. Several compounds are under development that address both underlying pathophysiological abnormalities and core ASD symptoms. This article reviews one of these treatments, d,l-leucovorin calcium (also known as folinic acid) for treatment of folate pathway abnormalities in children with ASD. Folate is a water-soluble B vitamin that is essential for normal neurodevelopment and abnormalities in the folate and related pathways have been identified in children with ASD. One of these abnormalities involves a partial blockage in the ability of folate to be transported into the brain utilizing the primary transport mechanism, the folate receptor alpha. Autoantibodies which interfere with the function of the folate receptor alpha called folate receptor alpha autoantibodies have been identified in 58%-76% of children with ASD and independent studies have demonstrated that blood titers of these autoantibodies correlate with folate levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. Most significantly, case-series, open-label, and single and double-blind placebo-controlled studies suggest that d,l-leucovorin, a reduced folate that can bypass the blockage at the folate receptor alpha by using the reduced folate carrier, an alternate pathway, can substantially improve particular symptoms in children with ASD, especially those positive for folate receptor alpha autoantibodies.

32,11122949,Current psychiatry reports,The genetics of Alzheimer's disease.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a genetically complex disorder. Mutations in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (PS1) genes are fully penetrant and cause early-onset AD. Mutations in presenilin 2, a PS1 homologue, cause partially penetrant autosomal dominant AD with onset age beginning at 40 years and extending past 75 years. A fourth gene, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a risk-factor for late-onset AD. Over 40 genes have been tested as AD candidate genes, yet none has been clearly established as an AD risk factor. Linkage studies have implicated a number of chromosome regions as possible sites for late-onset AD loci with the strongest evidence being for chromosome 12. Candidate genes in this region include alpha2-macroglobulin (A2M) and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related gene (LRP), although neither has been clearly established as an AD gene. Identification of additional late-onset genes will require larger samples, more sophisticated analysis methods, and large-scale positional cloning efforts.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
33,21523606,Pediatric radiology,Potential role of 3DUS in infants and children.,"The objective of this review is to discuss basic technical aspects as well as potential pediatric applications of three-dimensional ultrasound (3DUS). Different 3DUS-techniques are already commercially available. Most commonly, a transducer-integrated motor drives a scan-head to acquire a volumetric dataset, which is then reconstructed and viewed using various post-processing techniques. It has been proved feasible to apply 3DUS with pediatric transducers in typical pediatric investigations. Based on our own experiences and on review of the literature, 3DUS can be successfully used in infants and children for brain, spine, cardiac, urinary tract (particularly assessment of hydronephrosis, and virtual cystoscopy), and female genital (e.g., for assessment of uterine malformations) US, and for various other applications, particularly in small parts. Power Doppler data can be integrated, allowing 3DUS-angiography. Thus, 3DUS promises to become a useful adjunct for imaging children, particularly as it enhances ultrasound by offering additional, previously inaccessible planes, rendering options and surface assessments. 3DUS should be increasingly exploited, thus hopefully helping reduce the need for more invasive or burdening (e.g., ionizing radiation) investigations in children.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Nevertheless, some undesired clinical events, such as suicide have been emerging. As for 2004, the US and European regulatory agencies began implementing verification programs to assess the influence on suicidal behavior from the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). With the increasing number of reported cases, several newly developed antidepressants were faced with withdrawal from the markets. Despite unclear cause of suicide, researches focusing on revealing the relationship between efficacy and toxicities of antidepressants have been initiated in China and US. To deal with these undesired clinical consequences, new initiatives and revolutionary ideas have been proposed and verified.

Using standard legal research methods, this study reviewed drug paraphernalia, syringe prescription, drug possession, and syringe exchange laws and relevant case decisions in 59 jurisdictions.	Drug paraphernalia, syringe prescription, and drug possession laws.	Drug paraphernalia laws prohibit all possession of syringes by IDUs in 31 jurisdictions. Syringe prescription laws prohibit possession in 7 jurisdictions. In 53 jurisdictions, IDUs may be subject to prosecution for the possession of drug residue in used syringes. Only two states (HI, RI) have no legal barriers to safe syringe disposal by IDUs. Sixteen jurisdictions that have tried to expand syringe access for IDUs by authorizing SEPs or by deregulating pharmacy sale of syringes continue to have criminal law provisions that could pose barriers to proper disposal.	IDUs are a significant source of syringes disposed of outside the health care system. Involving IDUs in safe community sharps disposal programs is an important public health goal, but may be frustrated by legal barriers. Although this study looked only at law on the books, and not law as actually applied, ethnographic and survey research indicates that criminal laws do influence the syringe possession behavior of IDUs.

Mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades, have special value in this regard. It is important that the vulnerability to MPT-inducing factors is increased with aging. Simultaneously, a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed, which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons.	The systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of MPT as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs, especially with multitargeted action, are reviewed.	Here, we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs, and drugs with multitargeted action. We have also discussed a number of new compounds with similar properties. Being MPT inhibitors/modulators, virtually all the compounds described in this review have the ability to exhibit a neuroprotective effect, interact with some other targets, providing coupled beneficial therapeutic effects such as cognitive stimulation, anti-seizure, and antidepressant actions.	Inhibitors of MPT, which increases calcium retention capacity of mitochondria, are considered as promising neuroprotective drugs able not only to halt the neurodegenerative cascade, but also to increase the functional activity of neurons.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

In experiments on rodents, hypothermia in the postischemic period that is introduced up to several hours after reperfusion and is maintained for one day followed by a slow rewarming, significantly protects hippocampal neurons against damage. The mode of action of hypothermia is apparently non-specific and multi-focal in widely progressing cascade reactions in ischemic cells; namely, suppressing: (1) glutamate surge followed by; (2) intraneuronal calcium mobilization; (3) sustained activation of glutamate receptors; (4) dysfunction of blood brain barrier; (5) proliferation of microglial cells; and (6) production of superoxide anions and nitric oxide. In addition, mild hypothermia modulates processes in ischemic condition at the level of cell nucleus, such as the binding of transcription factor AP-1 to DNA, and ameliorates the depression of protein synthesis. This non-specific and widely affecting manner might explain why hypothermia is superior to any medicine developed. Recent clinical trials of mild hypothermia in various individual institutions have revealed significantly beneficial outcomes in some cases, along with an accumulation of practical knowledge of techniques and treatments. Large scale randomized studies involving multiple institutions as well as exchange of informations and ideas are needed for further development of hypothermia treatment.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Much has been learned recently about the mechanisms that lead to brain injury during meningitis. Once bacteria have gained access to the central nervous system, their multiplication triggers a complex host response consisting of humoral and cellular immune mediators, reactive oxygen intermediates, matrix-metalloproteinases, and other host-derived factors. Alterations of the cerebral vasculature, with disruption of the blood brain barrier and global and focal ischemia, ultimately lead to functional and structural brain damage.

The concepts of state and trait anxiety, and the most widely used measures of these, are reviewed. A measure of state anxiety is essential in some clinical and experimental research and it is often very useful in clinical practice. Whilst existing measures are satisfactory for some purposes, none adequately assesses the psychological, somatic and behavioural components of anxiety. The measurement of trait anxiety is also important in some clinical research and as part of the assessment of selected patients. In some circumstances, self report measures of trait anxiety should be used in conjunction with a measure of social desirability. Patients who score low both on trait anxiety and social desirability may respond differently to experimental stressors from those who score low on trait anxiety and high on social desirability. This may have a number of implications, for example in the area of psychoimmunology. Four scales are reviewed in more detail: the Courtauld Emotional Control Scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Clinical Anxiety Scale and the Fear Questionnaire.

This has been found in both physiologic and self-report measures. (2) Low and moderate doses of alcohol have been reported to increase overall affective expression, happiness, euphoria, conviviality and pleasant and carefree feelings. Tension, depression and self-consciousness have been reported to decrease with equal doses. (3) Low alcohol doses have been found to improve certain types of cognitive performance.

Sertindole , first withdrawn from the market for cardiovascular safety concerns, is currently available in many countries. It has high affinity for dopamine D2, serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C and a1-adrenergic receptors, and a low potential for extrapyramidal symptoms.	The pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability, and cost-effectiveness of sertindole are covered in this article, based on a literature review (PubMed) from 1990 to 2014.	The reviewed studies suggest a beneficial effect of sertindole on positive, negative and cognitive symptoms, and on relapse prevention. Although generally well tolerated, sertindole is associated with a dose-related QT-interval prolongation; thus, its administration requires electrocardiogram screening and monitoring. The presence of congenital long QT syndrome, prolongated QTc at baseline, cardiac disease and drug interactions should be carefully considered before prescribing sertindole. Further direct 'head-to-head' comparisons with other second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), trials on special populations and further clarification on cardiac safety are needed to better define the role of sertindole in the treatment of schizophrenia.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

Studies support the hypothesis that molecular mimicry between the group A streptococcus and heart or brain are important in directing immune responses in rheumatic fever. Rheumatic carditis, Sydenham chorea and a new group of behavioral disorders called pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections are reviewed with consideration of autoantibody and T cell responses and the role of molecular mimicry between the heart, brain and group A streptococcus as well as how immune responses contribute to pathogenic mechanisms in disease. In rheumatic carditis, studies have investigated human monoclonal autoantibodies and T cell clones for their crossreactivity and their mechanisms leading to valve damage in rheumatic heart disease. Although studies of human and animal sera from group A streptococcal diseases or immunization models have been crucial in providing clues to molecular mimicry and its role in the pathogenesis of rheumatic fever, study of human monoclonal autoantibodies have provided important insights into how antibodies against the valve may activate the valve endothelium and lead to T cell infiltration. Passive transfer of anti-streptococcal T cell lines in a rat model of rheumatic carditis illustrates effects of CD4+ T cells on the valve. Although Sydenham chorea has been known as the neurological manifestation of rheumatic fever for decades, the combination of autoimmunity and behavior is a relatively new concept linking brain, behavior and neuropsychiatric disorders with streptococcal infections. In Sydenham chorea, human mAbs and their expression in transgenic mice have linked autoimmunity to central dopamine pathways as well as dopamine receptors and dopaminergic neurons in basal ganglia.

59,28350947,Neurosurgery,Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury-Repair and Regeneration,"BACKGROUND: Traumatic spinal cord injuries (SCI) have devastating consequences for the physical, financial, and psychosocial well-being of patients and their caregivers. Expediently delivering interventions during the early postinjury period can have a tremendous impact on long-term functional recovery. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY: This is largely due to the unique pathophysiology of SCI where the initial traumatic insult (primary injury) is followed by a progressive secondary injury cascade characterized by ischemia, proapoptotic signaling, and peripheral inflammatory cell infiltration. Over the subsequent hours, release of proinflammatory cytokines and cytotoxic debris (DNA, ATP, reactive oxygen species) cyclically adds to the harsh postinjury microenvironment. As the lesions mature into the chronic phase, regeneration is severely impeded by the development of an astroglial-fibrous scar surrounding coalesced cystic cavities. Addressing these challenges forms the basis of current and upcoming treatments for SCI. MANAGEMENT: This paper discusses the evidence-based management of a patient with SCI while emphasizing the importance of early definitive care. Key neuroprotective therapies are summarized including surgical decompression, methylprednisolone, and blood pressure augmentation. We then review exciting neuroprotective interventions on the cusp of translation such as Riluzole, Minocycline, magnesium, therapeutic hypothermia, and CSF drainage. We also explore the most promising neuroregenerative strategies in trial today including Cethrin™, anti-NOGO antibody, cell-based approaches, and bioengineered biomaterials.

A growing body of evidence suggests that the type of epilepsy (benign or catastrophic) and the age of the patient affect developmental outcome. In younger children with catastrophic epilepsy, the primary goal of therapy is not only to control seizures, but also to offer the child the opportunity for the best possible development. In older children with partial seizures, the therapeutic goal is to control seizures, which may allow a more normal life and improve behavior. Epilepsy surgery generally appears to have a positive effect on behavior and development in many younger children with catastrophic epilepsy.

While the condition has been well described in patients with acute hypertension, pre-eclampsia, eclampsia, post-transplantation and chemotherapy, RPLS has been increasingly identified in patients with autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Though experience in the diagnosis and management of RPLS in patients with SLE is likely accumulating, few have systematically worked out the strategy to distinguish RPLS from neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) and lupus-related complications of the central nervous system (CNS). Prompt recognition of, and differentiation between, these conditions is essential since their clinical presentations substantially overlap and yet their management strategy and subsequent outcomes can be entirely different. Indeed, inappropriate treatment such as augmentation of immunosuppression may be detrimental to patients with RPLS. A high index of suspicion of RPLS, prompt magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, including diffusion imaging, exclusion of CNS infection and metabolic derangement, a comprehensive medication review accompanied by timely and aggressive control of blood pressure and seizure are keys to successful management of RPLS. Such treatment strategy ensures a very high chance of total neurological recovery in lupus patients with RPLS.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

66,11572527,"Journal of obstetric, gynecologic, and neonatal nursing : JOGNN",Symptom experience in women after hysterectomy.,"To review the literature addressing the symptom experience of women after hysterectomy.	Computerized searches in MEDLINE and CINAHL, as well as texts and references cited in articles. Key concepts in the searches included hysterectomy, sleep disturbance and pain, hysterectomy and fatigue, hysterectomy, depression, and depressed mood.	Articles and comprehensive works relevant to key concepts and published after 1970, with an emphasis on new findings from 1990 to 2000. Sixty-four citations were identified as useful to this review.	Data were organized under the following headings: women and hysterectomy, biopsychosocial perspectives, common symptoms after hysterectomy (pain, disturbed sleep, fatigue, depressed mood, anxiety), and significance of review (implications).	Literature suggests that after a hysterectomy, women experience complications during the postoperative recovery period that may vary with the type of surgical procedure. During this period, the quantity and quality of sleep as well as other symptoms (pain, fatigue, anxiety, and depression) are influenced by various physiologic, psychologic, and social factors. Despite limited evidence that sleep problems may occur frequently during the recovery period, only a few researchers have systematically examined sleep patterns in women after hysterectomy. None of these studies, however, used objective sleep measures or examined multiple dimensions of these women's lives.	This review conceptualized the women's symptom experience as the experience of specific symptoms (pain, sleep disturbance, fatigue, depressed mood, and anxiety) that were influenced by biopsychosocial factors.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

69,1308085,African journal of medicine and medical sciences,Alzheimer's disease in Nigeria.,"The age-related dementias of the elderly (those aged 65 years or more) are of major public health importance in developed countries. Developing countries, most of which are undergoing epidemiological transition and greying of population, currently contain more than half of the world's population of elderly, a proportion that would reach 75% by 2020. Apart from reports from China, there is little or no information on the dementias of the elderly in developing countries. Alzheimer's disease, which accounts for two-thirds of dementia of the elderly in Caucasian population, is under-documented and believed to be rare in black Africans. But black Americans who are of black African lineage commonly suffer from Alzheimer's disease. A recent autopsy survey of the brains of elderly Nigerians showed absence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, the pathognomonic histologic lesions of Alzheimer's disease and ageing found in 25% to 80% of normal undemented elderly Caucasians and Japanese. In a community-based door-to-door survey of a population of 9000, including 932 elderly Nigerians, no subject with dementia as defined by DSM-IIIR was found, although there was significant decline of cognition with age, female sex and less than 6 years of formal education. The distribution of cognitive scores is a highly skewed unimodal curve. We emphasize the potential value of cross-cultural epidemiological studies of ethnic groups in different environments and with different prevalence ratios of Alzheimer's disease, in identifying putative environmental factors for this disease.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

A low serum triiodothyronine (T3) level is commonly noted in starvation states and is caused by reduced peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to T3. Diminished T4 concentrations are also observed. Adequate nutrition normalizes this type of aberrant laboratory profile. Thyroid function tests that give results below the normal range are best repeated initially for verification of results and again after adequate nutrition is reestablished. If no primary endocrinopathy is present, spontaneous correction of these laboratory values can be expected with conventional dietary habits.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
71,22082429,Headache,Insights into the mechanism of onabotulinumtoxinA in chronic migraine.,"OnabotulinumtoxinA has recently been approved by regulatory agencies in the UK and United States for treatment of chronic migraine based on data generated from the PREEMPT studies. As such, onabotulinumtoxinA is the only prophylactic therapy specifically approved for chronic migraine. Most headache clinicians would agree that acute episodic migraine and chronic migraine differ in their pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and response to pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological therapies. Of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes, botulinum neurotoxin type A (onabotulinumtoxinA) has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Based on preclinical studies, onabotulinumtoxinA is known to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from both motor and sensory neurons by preventing vesicle fusion to the cell membrane. In addition to the well-documented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin, onabotulinumtoxinA can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons. The inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxinA are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization. This article describes possible mechanisms to explain how onabotulinumtoxinA functions as a therapy for chronic migraine and considers why treatment with the neurotoxin is not effective in some chronic migraineurs.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

73,32045917,Neuro-degenerative diseases,Potential Mechanism of Venous System for Leukoaraiosis: From post-mortem to in vivo Research.,"Leukoaraiosis (LA), widely accepted as a feature of cerebral small vessel disease, significantly increases the incidence of stroke, dementia, and death. Cerebral small artery disease has been considered as one of the main causes of LA. However, since the term 'venous collagenosis' (VC) was proposed in an atrophy research in 1995, there have been pathological and neuroimaging studies proving the association between the venous system and LA in aging, Alz-heimer's disease (AD), and Parkinson's disease.	Autopsy studies confirmed that thickening of the lumen wall in venules, which results from the deposition of collagen I and III, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion, is closely associated with LA. Susceptibility-weighted imaging research revealed a controversial association of deep medullary veins and LA in vivo, regarding which there are no standard criteria currently. Nevertheless, retinal venous changes had been reported to increase the risk of LA development, providing a novel way for in vivo evaluation. As for the internal jugular vein, jugular venous reflux could double the LA score in aging and modulate circulation of cerebral spinal fluids. Key Messages: Disruption of the venous system was notably associated with LA in aging, AD, and Parkinson's disease post-mortem and in in vivo models. The venous pathological changes may induce cerebral hypoperfusion, drainage system disruption, and vasogenic oedema in the veins around the periventricular white matter. The clarification of VC in LA may provide an early prevention and early treatment strategy for LA patients.",Non-systematic-review,1,0
74,31730793,Progress in neurobiology,N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) and glutamate carboxypeptidase II: An abundant peptide neurotransmitter-enzyme system with multiple clinical applications.,"N-Acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG) is the third most prevalent neurotransmitter in the mammalian nervous system, yet its therapeutic potential is only now being fully recognized. Drugs that inhibit the inactivation of NAAG by glutamate carboxypeptidase II (GCPII) increase its extracellular concentration and its activation of its receptor, mGluR3. These drugs warrant attention, as they are effective in animal models of several clinical disorders including stroke, traumatic brain injury and schizophrenia. In inflammatory and neuropathic pain studies, GCPII inhibitors moderated both the primary and secondary pain responses when given systemically, locally or in brain regions associated with the pain perception pathway. The finding that GCPII inhibition also moderated the motor and cognitive effects of ethanol intoxication led to the discovery of their procognitive efficacy in long-term memory tests in control mice and in short-term memory in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. NAAG and GCPII inhibitors respectively reduce cocaine self-administration and the rewarding effects of a synthetic stimulant. Most recently, GCPII inhibition also has been reported to be efficacious in a model of inflammatory bowel disease. GCPII was first discovered as a protein expressed by and released from metastatic prostate cells where it is known as prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA). GCPII inhibitors with high affinity for this protein have been developed as prostate imaging and radiochemical therapies for prostate cancer. Taken together, these data militate in favor of the development and application of GCPII inhibitors in more advanced preclinical research as a prelude to clinical trials.",Non-systematic-review,1,0

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-over clinical trial with depression or anxiety conducted in an office setting. Following randomization to the prayer intervention or control groups, subjects (95% women) completed Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety, Life Orientation Test, Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, and underwent measurement of cortisol levels. Individuals in the direct person-to-person prayer contact intervention group received six weekly 1-hour prayer sessions while those in the control group received none. Rating scales and cortisol levels were repeated for both groups after completion of the prayer sessions, and a month later. ANOVAs were used to compare pre- and post-prayer measures for each group. RESULTS: At the completion of the trial, participants receiving the prayer intervention showed significant improvement of depression and anxiety, as well as increases of daily spiritual experiences and optimism compared to controls (p < 0.01 in all cases). Subjects in the prayer group maintained these significant improvements (p < 0.01 in all cases) for a duration of at least 1 month after the final prayer session. Participants in the control group did not show significant changes during the study. Cortisol levels did not differ significantly between intervention and control groups, or between pre- and post-prayer conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Direct contact person-to-person prayer may be useful as an adjunct to standard medical care for patients with depression and anxiety.

Sixty-five subjects randomly assigned to treatment group were tested at baseline and end of treatment. Subjects' mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 10.83; mean age was 87. Treatment was given for 30 minutes three times a week for 16 weeks. Subjects in the assisted walking group declined 20.9% in functional mobility; the conversation group declined 18.8%. The combined walking and conversation treatment group declined only 2.5%. These differences in outcome were significant and appear to have been affected by differences in treatment fidelity. Subjects in the conversation treatment group completed 90% of intended treatment compared with 75% in the combined group and only 57% in the assisted walking group. Failure to treat was due to subject refusal and physical illness. The conversation component of the combined walking and conversation treatment intervention appears to have improved compliance with the intervention, thereby improving treatment outcome. Results indicate that assisted walking with conversation can contribute to maintenance of functional mobility in institutionalized populations with Alzheimer disease.

METHODS: Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design. 110 residents were randomized by nursing home into three conditions: mahjong, Tai Chi, and simple handicrafts (control). Activities were conducted three times a week for 12 weeks. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was taken at 0 (baseline), 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 9 months. The outcome measure was CDR sum-of-box, which is a composite measure of both cognitive and functional deterioration in dementia. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using multilevel regression models. Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele and education were included as covariates. Neither treatments had effects on the cognitive and functional components of the CDR, but mahjong had a significant interaction with time on the CDR sum-of-box total, suggesting a slower rate of global deterioration in the mahjong group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Mahjong led to a gradual improvement in global functioning and a slightly slower rate of dementia progression over time. The effect was generalized and was not specific to cognition or daily functioning.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

During the following year, half of the former were placed in community settings while nearly all of the latter remained in the hospital. Neither the physical health, level of self-care, or psychiatric condition ratings of the two groups changed differentially over that time. However, the mean Morale Inventory score of the outplacement sample improved while that of the in-patient group remained static. Additional analyses were run between three groups - outplacement planning subjects who were released, those who were not released, and inpatient planning men who were not released. These results confirmed those of the first analyses; the only significant difference appeared on the Morale Inventory, the patients who left showing more improvement than the other two groups.

METHODS: Sixty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 16-weeks of Outdoor Cycling (OC) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 38.7 ± 10.1) or Occupational Therapy (OT) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 39.0 ± 8.6). OC and OT involved one 90-min group session per week. OC consisted of structured exercise programs and OT addressed daily living skills. Primary outcome measurements were mental health variables, such as Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning and executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST). Secondary measures were the adherence and PA. PA was measured by responding to the Physical Activity Scale (K-PASE) and wearing a pedometer for 2 days. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed improved psychotic symptoms (p = .014), depression (p = .007), state (p = .031) and trait anxiety (p = .002) and global functions (p = .024) in the OC group compared with OT group. The OC group showed increased correct rates (p = .022) and categories completed (p = .033) in the WCST. There was no difference in total K-PASE score between groups; however, there was a significant improvement in the number of daily steps in the OC group compared with the OT group (p = .030). CONCLUSION: OC significantly improved mental health and executive function in individuals with schizophrenia. Further, OC significantly increased PA measured by the pedometers. These findings suggest that OC offers a safe and attrition-lowering intervention promoting mental health and PA.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the intervention and to examine the effectiveness of the implementation strategies in promoting home-based adoption. METHODS: This was a cluster randomized controlled trial adopting a clinical effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. The 12-week music-with-movement intervention aims to promote the well-being of people with dementia and their caregivers. Clinical outcomes were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. These included the symptoms of anxiety and depression of people with dementia; caregivers' perception of their stress and the positive aspects of caregiving; and the quality of the dyadic relationship. Caregivers, staff, and volunteers were interviewed and objective figures on reach and adoption were collected to reflect the outcomes of the implementation. RESULTS: Compared to the waitlist control, there was a significant reduction in the anxiety and the symptoms of depression of those in the intervention group. There was also a significant reduction in the perceived stress level of the caregivers. Six focus group interviews were conducted. The intervention and the appropriateness of the implementation strategies were perceived positively by the dyad participants, the staff of the centres, and volunteers. Of the collaborating centres, 57% continued to use the intervention and, after six months, served six times more people than were recruited in this study. Over half of the participating families continued to use the intervention for at least six more months. CONCLUSION: Music-with-movement interventions showed promise for improving the well-being of people with dementia and their caregivers. Effective strategies facilitated the implementation process, such as integrating communication technology to provide instant support and involving volunteers in engaging the collaborating centres and families. This study sheds light on perceptions of the intervention, and on its scalability for a broader population.

In the present study, we investigate the effect of individually prescribed coloured overlays on the rate of reading. Subjects were 33 children and adults who: had consulted a specific learning difficulties clinic; had received treatment to normalise any conventional optometric and orthoptic anomalies; and subsequently reported symptomatic relief from coloured filters. These subjects carried out the Wilkins Rate of Reading Test (which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors) under two conditions: with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter. Steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and, when asked which they preferred, subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter (p=0.11). Nonetheless, the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control (p=0.0019).

89,rayyan-1277754934,Brain Stimul,A randomized controlled trial of sequentially bilateral prefrontal cortex repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been investigated for its treatment efficacy for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Previous studies have targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is associated with the pathophysiology of this disorder. Several rTMS parameters have been explored in the treatment of negative symptoms and include stimulating the left and bilateral DLPFC at several different frequencies and number of sessions. Results of such studies have been inconsistent, while high-frequency rTMS has shown greatest promise. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral high-frequency rTMS in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. It was hypothesized rTMS would alleviate negative symptoms in schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial. Bilateral 20 Hz rTMS was MRI-targeted to the DLPFC at 90% RMT administered daily for 4 weeks for a total of 20 treatments. Negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale (PANSS), and controlling for depression as measured with the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 2 weeks after the treatment course. RESULTS: No significant group or time differences were found on negative symptoms or depressive symptoms after rTMS. Bilateral high-frequency rTMS did not alleviate negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

Growing numbers of people with early-stage dementia are contributing accounts that emphasise the benefits of actively engaging in managing the condition. Self-management interventions share the common objectives of educating about the condition, optimising well-being, enhancing control over the situation and enabling people to take more responsibility for managing the condition. Benefits of such an approach can include improved knowledge, self-efficacy, health status, and better performance of self-management behaviours. However, there is only preliminary evidence that people with early-stage dementia can benefit from such interventions. METHODS: This feasibility study involves the development of a self-management group intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. This study is a single-site pilot randomised-controlled trial. Forty-two people with early stage dementia, each with a caregiver (family member/friend), will be randomised to either the self-management group intervention or to treatment as usual.The self-management group intervention will involve eight weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, held at a memory clinic in North Wales. All participants will be re-assessed three and six months post-randomisation. This study is intended to supply an early evaluation of the self-management intervention so that a full scale trial may be powered from the best available evidence. It will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the study design and the recruitment strategies. It will estimate the parameters and confidence intervals for the research questions of interest. The primary outcome of interest is the self-efficacy score of the person with dementia at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for the person with dementia are self-efficacy at six months post-randomisation and cognitive ability, mood and well-being at three and six months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for caregivers are their distress and stress at three and six months post-randomisation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This study will provide preliminary information about the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a self-management group intervention for people in the early stages of dementia.

METHOD: Thirty-seven adolescents meeting DSM-III-R criteria for anorexia nervosa were randomly assigned to receive BFST or EOIT, in addition to a common medical and dietary regimen. In BFST, the family was seen conjointly, the parents were placed in control of the adolescent's eating, distorted beliefs were targeted through cognitive restructuring, and strategic/behavioral interventions were used to change family interactions. In EOIT, the adolescent was seen individually, with an emphasis on building ego strength and uncovering the dynamics blocking eating; parents were seen collaterally. Measures administered before, after, and at 1-year follow-up tapped body mass index, menstruation, eating attitudes, ego functioning, depression, and family interactions. RESULTS: BFST produced greater weight gain and higher rates of resumption of menstruation than EOIT. Both treatments produced comparably large improvements in eating attitudes, depression, and eating-related family conflict, but very few changes occurred on ego functioning. CONCLUSIONS: BFST and EOIT proved to be effective treatments for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, but BFST produced a faster return to health.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Our study explores the efficacy of Pranic Healing (PH), as an adjuvant therapy in treating depression Methods: In this randomised double-blind controlled trial, 52 participants with a mean age of 34.4 years, with mild to moderate depression were assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating (HAM-D) scale during the 5-week study. Both Medication + PH (MedPH) and Medication + Mock PH (MedMockPH) groups comprising 26 members received Pranic and mock healing lasting 20 minutes per session respectively once a week for 4 weeks, along with the antidepressant drug.	The average decrease in HAM-D score in MedPH was median 11 (Interquartile Range (IQR) 7-12) and was significantly higher compared with the MedMockPH group median 6.5 (IQR 3-9). At pre-assessment, both groups had 8 cases of mild and 18 cases of moderate depression. At post-assessment, HAM-D showed that the improvement in depression category was seen in 69.2% of participants in the MedMockPH group and 100% in MedPH group.	These results give first the evidence that PH can aid as an adjuvant therapy for depressed people.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Seven cases are presented. HCSR is a relative condition; besides increased irritability of the receptor or target organs, susceptibility of the nerve center to ischemia probably is induced by a slow heart rate or low blood pressure in any patient with pre-existing occlusive cerebrovascular disease. Dizziness and syncope of this type represent hemodynamic TIA in contrast to thromboembolic TIA. The carotid sinus massage test is recommended for differentiating the two types of TIA; the treatments differ. At present there is no uniform management that can be applied to either TIA or HCSR routinely. Therefore, treatment should be approached on an individual basis, keeping in mind the different pathophysiologic factors operating in the specific patient.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of routine video-EEG and video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime, in the diagnosis of NFLE. We studied 23 patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks using a 3-level neurophysiological evaluation, including video-EEG when awake (level 1), video-EEG after sleep deprivation, during the daytime (level 2) and nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3). All the patients had a normal video-EEG when awake. The video-EEG after sleep deprivation (level 2) allowed a diagnosis of NFLE in 52.2% of the patients, while the nocturnal video-polysomnography (level 3) allowed this diagnosis in 87.0% of the same sample. In the patients complaining of repeated nocturnal motor attacks, a video-EEG after sleep deprivation performed during the daytime, could be useful for diagnosis in about one half of cases. This methodology is routinely performed in many Departments of Neurology and Epileptology, and is much less binding and expensive than nocturnal video-polysomnography and so it could be important economically for the health service.",Remaining,0,0

97,28951181,World neurosurgery,Clinical Accuracy of Customized Stereotactic Fixtures for Stereoelectroencephalography.,"Stereoelectroencephalograpy (SEEG) is a diagnostic method involving 3-dimensional exploration of brain structures using depth electrodes for locating epileptogenic foci in patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. A variety of frame-based, frameless, and robotic stereotactic systems have been designed for the accurate placement of depth electrodes.	Using the FHC microTargeting platform as a model, we introduce a fully customized design that has all the constructive elements positioned by a computer algorithm, according to the planned trajectories, anchoring points, and anatomic constraints. All the constructive elements form a single-body fixture, which allows for the efficient implantation of multiple depth electrodes following trajectories having a wide range of orientations. We aim at evaluating the safety and accuracy of this stereotactic system in a clinical setting.	A total of 173 depth electrodes were implanted in 21 patients with drug-resistant epilepsy. Matlab and DEETO software packages were used to postoperatively evaluate the targeting accuracy. Automatic detection of electrode locations eliminated any subjectivity in calculating the targeting errors.	As a result of using custom geometry of the stereotactic platform, the new design is optimized for each patient and streamlines the surgical procedures. The most important results characterizing the platform's accuracy are the values of 1.22 mm for the median lateral target point localization error and 1.17 mm for the median lateral entry point localization error.	The patient-customized platforms are comparable in terms of safety, accuracy, and simplicity of use to the existing robotic devices for implantation of depth electrodes in patients undergoing SEEG investigations.",Remaining,0,0

Yet this information is essential for the management of sleep bruxism and to plan appropriate dental treatment. The objective of this study was to clinically test a device that could be used to record bruxism events in a home environment. Pressure sensors were developed for use under the surface of an occlusal splint, and circuitry was designed to facilitate the recording and wireless transmission of the pressure sensor signal to a computer. Controlled mandibular movements were carried out in vivo to simulate bruxism and non-bruxism patterns. These patterns of force application were graphically presented to two examiners who were asked to identify the type of activity represented by the force curves. Examiners were largely able to distinguish bruxism from non-bruxism activity; the sensitivity ranged from 80% to 100% and the specificity from 75% to 100%. Using sensors in an occlusal splint, it is possible to recognise the typical tooth contact patterns seen in sleep bruxism. Such a device may be useful for monitoring sleep bruxism over an extended period at home.",Remaining,0,0

100,35274469,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research,Attribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder: A study of event-related potentials.,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is characterized by social cognition deficits, including difficulties inferring the intentions of others. Although deficits in attribution of intentions (AI) have been consistently replicated in ASD, their exact nature remains unexplored. Here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate AI in autistic adults. Twenty-one male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action (AI) or physical causality with or without human characters, while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded. Compared to neurotypical volunteers, autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the AI condition, but not in the physical causality conditions. In the AI condition a bilateral posterior positive event-related potential (ERP) occurred 200-400 ms post-stimulus (the ERP intention effect) in both groups. This waveform comprised a P200 and a P300 component, with the P200 component being larger for the AI condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals, who also showed a longer latency for this waveform. Group differences in amplitude of the ERP intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants, suggesting that the atypical ERP waveform in ASD is an effect of group, rather than a marker of low-task performance. Together, these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the ASD group in the AI task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues. LAY SUMMARY: To understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others' intentions, we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions (e.g., fetching a chair to reach for something) or situations solely following physical rules (e.g., an apple falling on someone's head), while their electrical brain activity was recorded. Autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls, which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues.",Remaining,0,0
101,28867587,Neuroscience letters,Cerebellar pathology in childhood-onset vs. adult-onset essential tremor.,"Although the incidence of ET increases with advancing age, the disease may begin at any age, including childhood. The question arises as to whether childhood-onset ET cases manifest the same sets of pathological changes in the cerebellum as those whose onset is during adult life. We quantified a broad range of postmortem features (Purkinje cell [PC] counts, PC axonal torpedoes, a host of associated axonal changes [PC axonal recurrent collateral count, PC thickened axonal profile count, PC axonal branching count], heterotopic PCs, and basket cell rating) in 60 ET cases (11 childhood-onset and 49 adult-onset) and 30 controls. Compared to controls, childhood-onset ET cases had lower PC counts, higher torpedo counts, higher heterotopic PC counts, higher basket cell plexus rating, and marginally higher PC axonal recurrent collateral counts. The median PC thickened axonal profile count and median PC axonal branching count were two to five times higher in childhood-onset ET than controls, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. Childhood-onset and adult-onset ET had similar PC counts, torpedo counts, heterotopic PC counts, basket cell plexus rating, PC axonal recurrent collateral counts, PC thickened axonal profile count and PC axonal branching count. In conclusion, we found that childhood-onset and adult-onset ET shared similar pathological changes in the cerebellum. The data suggest that pathological changes we have observed in the cerebellum in ET are a part of the pathophysiological cascade of events in both forms of the disease and that both groups seem to reach the same pathological endpoints at a similar age of death.",Remaining,0,0
102,22926093,Journal of pain and symptom management,Emotional numbness modifies the effect of end-of-life discussions on end-of-life care.,"Overall, end-of-life (EOL) discussions are unrelated to psychological distress and associated with lower rates of aggressive care near death. Nevertheless, patients who report that they feel emotionally numb about their illness might encounter difficulties cognitively processing an EOL discussion.	We hypothesized that emotional numbness would modify the effect of EOL discussions on the receipt of less aggressive EOL care.	Data were derived from structured interviews with 290 participants in the federally-funded Coping with Cancer Study, a multisite, prospective cohort study of patients with advanced cancer followed-up till their death. Patients' reports of EOL discussions with their physician and emotional numbness were assessed at a median of 4.6 months before their death. Information about aggressive EOL care (i.e., ventilation, resuscitation in the last week of life, death in the intensive care unit) was obtained from postmortem caregiver interviews and medical charts. Main and interactive effects of EOL discussions and emotional numbness on aggressive EOL care, adjusting for potential confounds, were evaluated using multiple logistic regression.	The likelihood of aggressive EOL care associated with having EOL discussions increased by a factor of nine (adjusted odds ratio=9.02, 95% CI 1.37, 59.6, P=0.022) for every unit increase in a patient's emotional numbness score.	Emotional numbness diminishes a patient's capacity to benefit from EOL discussions. The EOL decision making may be more effective if clinical communications with emotionally numb patients are avoided.",Remaining,0,0

Before surgery, 2,266 participants (median age 46 years; 78.6% female; 86.9% white; median body mass index 45.9 kg/m(2)) of the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 (LABS-2) study completed eating behavior survey items in the self-administered LABS-2 Behavior form. Other measures included the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, the LABS-2 Psychiatric and Emotional Test Survey, the Beck Depression Inventory, the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List-12, the Short Form-36 Health Survey, and Impact of Weight Quality of Life-Lite Survey.	The majority (92.1%) of participants reported eating dinner regularly, whereas just over half (54.0%) reported eating breakfast regularly. Half of the participants reported eating at least four meals/week at restaurants; two meals/week were fast food. Loss of control eating was reported by 43.4%, night eating syndrome by 17.7%; 15.7% satisfied criteria for binge eating disorder (BED), 2% for bulimia nervosa. Factors that independently increased the odds of BED were being a college graduate, eating more times per day, taking medication for psychiatric or emotional problems, and having symptoms of alcohol use disorder, lower self-esteem and greater depressive symptoms.	Before undergoing bariatric surgery a substantial proportion of patients report problematic eating behaviors. Several factors associated with BED were identified, most suggesting other mental health problems, including higher levels of depressive symptomotology. The strengths of this study include the large sample size, the multi-center design and use of standardized assessment practices.",Remaining,0,0
104,9520072,European neurology,Cerebrospinal fluid levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta-peptide in Alzheimer's disease and major depression - inverse correlation with dementia severity.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive dementia that ultimately leads to death. Histopathological hallmarks of AD include brain amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles. Major depression is a frequent diagnosis in every gerontopsychiatric clinic that sees patients with both cognitive and affective disorders. Many depressed patients, in fact, are clinically characterized by cognitive impairments. Thus, an assay that excludes - or confirms - probable AD in cognitively impaired patients is desirable. Such assays may use protein markers that are derived from such histopathologically relevant molecules as the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its derivatives including the amyloid beta-peptides (Abeta). To evaluate the differential diagnostic properties of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Abeta and secreted soluble ectodomain (APPs), we quantitated CSF levels of these measures in AD patients and compared them to age-matched control patients with major depression. CSF levels of APPs and Abeta were similar in patients with AD or major depression, and the apolipoprotein E genotype had no influence on CSF levels of Abeta in AD patients. Measurement of Abeta peptide using a novel zinc/copper capture ELISA that detects aggregated Abeta peptides as well demonstrated similar levels in AD and major depression. In AD patients, CSF levels of total Abeta (Abeta1-40 plus Abeta1-42) were inversely correlated with a functional measure of dementia severity (NOSGER), suggesting that CSF levels of Abeta decrease with advancing severity of AD. Thus, CSF levels of Abeta are not useful for the differentiation of AD from major depression. However, CSF levels of Abeta reflect the severity of dementia and may be useful as biological markers of the stage of the disease.",Remaining,0,0

We examined 82 cases with transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) as well as ambulatory (Holter) ECG and 12 leads ECG. Thirty-three patients had cerebral ischemic attack (CIA), including 14 patients with mitral stenosis (MS) and 19 patients with other heart disease or lone Af (NonMS). The CIA group of NonMS were older than other groups. Both the CIA and NonCIA groups had the same frequency of paroxysmal and chronic Af. In the CIA group, there was a tendency of small amplitude of f wave and longer RR interval than the NonCIA group with ambulatory ECG. The CIA group also had larger left atrial cavity size and aortic diameter with TTE. TEE revealed thrombus formation in 29 cases, and the CIA group had a higher occurrence rate of thrombus than NonCIA group. TEE also detected a fuzzy echo in the left atrium in 88% of the CIA group and 42% of the NonCIA group. The risk factors of cerebral embolism could not be made clear in this study, but a fuzzy echo and thrombus in the left atrium with TEE are specific findings of cerebral embolism. Therefore, older patients with paroxysmal Af, large LAD, AOD, small f wave or long RR interval need to be examined by TEE to detect LA thrombus or a fuzzy echo, which are probably major risk factors of cerebral embolism.",Remaining,0,0

A factor analysis was performed, based on the polychoric correlations matrix, between ZSDS items using promax oblique rotation in 1049 PC patients with a diagnosis of MDD (DSM-IV).	A clinical interpretable four-factor solution consisting of a core depressive factor (I); a cognitive factor (II); an anxiety factor (III) and a somatic factor (IV) was extracted. These factors accounted for 36.9% of the variance on the ZSDS. The 4-factor structure was validated and high coefficients of congruence were obtained (0.98, 0.95, 0.92 and 0.87 for factors I, II, III and IV, respectively). The model seemed to fit the data well with fit indexes within recommended ranges (GFI = 0.9330, AGFI = 0.9112 and RMR = 0.0843).	Our findings suggest that depressive symptoms in patients with MDD in the PC setting cluster into four dimensions: core depressive, cognitive, anxiety and somatic, by means of a factor analysis of the ZSDS. Further research is needed to identify possible diagnostic, therapeutic or prognostic implications of the different depressive symptomatic profiles.",Remaining,0,0
107,33860704,Aging & mental health,Medical help-seeking intentions for cognitive impairment by the patient.,"Objectives: Older adults represent one of the fastest growing population groups. As the aged population increases, incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other dementias will also increase. Professionals agree that early intervention is essential for therapeutic and quality of life purposes; however, many older adults wait several months or years to seek medical help after first noticing signs of cognitive impairment. The present study sought to identify the predictors of help-seeking for cognitive impairment by an individual for him/herself after the first detection of symptoms.Method: An online survey was administered to adults (N = 250) 50 years old and older. Individuals responded about their help-seeking intentions in response to a hypothetical vignette depicting symptoms of cognitive decline derived from a similar study with caregivers conducted by Qualls and colleagues. Additional standardized measures measuring constructs such as knowledge of Alzheimer's disease were completed.Results: The present study reveals that cognitive (i.e. symptom identification and disease attribution) and affective (i.e. symptom impact and threat appraisal) factors, as well as an interaction between the two, are predictive of help-seeking intentions with excellent model fit.Conclusion: Help-seeking intentions by individuals with possible cognitive impairment are comparable to those of potential caregivers. Contrary to hypotheses, high threat appraisal positively predicted help-seeking intentions despite the expectation that threat-induced fear would lead to avoidance. Recommendations are made for future research to further investigate both patients' help-seeking intentions and actions in response to signs of cognitive impairment.Supplemental data for this article is available online at https://doi.org/10.1080/13607863.2021.1910791 .",Remaining,0,0

This study investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CompCog, a computerized cognitive screening battery focusing on reaction time measurements.	A sample of 52 older adults underwent neuropsychological assessments, including CompCog, and medical appointments, to be classified as a control group or be diagnosed with MCI. The accuracy of CompCog for distinguishing between the two groups was calculated.	The results from diagnostic accuracy analyses showed that the AUCs of ROC curves were as high as 0.915 (CI 0.837-0.993). The subtest with the highest sensitivity and specificity (choice reaction time subtest) had 91.7% sensitivity and 89.3% specificity. The logistic regression final model correctly classified 92.3% of individuals, with 92.9% specificity and 91.7% sensitivity, and included only four variables from different subtests.	In summary, the study showed that reaction time assessed through CompCog is a good screening measure to differentiate between normal aging and MCI. Reaction time measurements in milliseconds were more accurate than correct answers. This test can form part of routine clinical tests to achieve the objectives of screening for MCI, indicating further procedures for investigation and diagnosis and planning interventions.

Severely impaired global functioning was associated with female gender (adjusted OR = 2.75) and unstable housing status (adjusted OR = 2.21).	Findings highlight the importance of examining post-migration variables such as length of time in country prior to receiving services in addition to pre-migration torture history upon relocated torture survivors. Clinicians and policy-makers should be aware of the importance of early mental health screening and intervention on reducing the psychiatric burden associated with torture and forced relocation.",Remaining,0,0
113,6734429,Drug and alcohol dependence,Some personality characteristics of imprisoned heroin addicts.,"A group of 20 imprisoned heroin addicts was compared on 4 personality dimensions with a group of non-addict fellow prisoners and a group of normal controls. The 4 personality measures examined were level of self-esteem, perceived locus of control, tendency to self-deception and tendency to project a flattering self-image. The addict group was significantly lower in self-esteem and significantly less inclined to project a flattering self-image than the normal controls. However the addicts were similar to their fellow prisoners on all the psychological measures. The addict and non-addict prisoners were also similar in respect of various socioeconomic indices and criminal history. The belief that one could give up use of heroin without outside help was found to distinguish a subgroup of addicts who were at an earlier stage in the addiction process. However this subgroup did not differ from the more experienced addicts on the 4 psychological measures.",Remaining,0,0

To investigate the extent, context, experience and preferences for participation in out-of-school activities among children with disability in Victoria, Australia.	Two-hundred and eighty-six children (177 boys, 109 girls; mean age 11.5 years) with physical (n=77), intellectual (n=67), multiple (n=93), and other disabilities (n=49) took part. Data were collected using the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment (CAPE) and Preferences for Activities of Children (PAC) questionnaires.	Children with disability participated in 28 out of 55 activities (SD 6 activities), 2-3 times per month, on average. Preference was the most important predictor of participation diversity for all activity types. Disability type was a predictor of participation diversity in active-physical activities only. Severity was a predictor of participation diversity overall, and of participation in formal and informal activities. Age, severity and preference accounted for almost 50% of the variance of diversity of recreational activities.	These results underscore the importance of taking a child's activity preferences into account when implementing interventions to increase participation in out-of-school activities.",Remaining,0,0

A new stroke imaging protocol was initiated at Emory University Hospital including computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and computed tomographic perfusion (CTP). All patients presenting within 4.5 hours from last known normal time with suspected stroke were prospectively identified. Impact of CTA and CTP on the clinical management was recorded prospectively by stroke team members.	During the study period, 87 patients met eligibility criteria for the CTA/CTP protocol, of which 83 (95%) underwent this upfront comprehensive imaging protocol and 30 (34%) received IV thrombolytics. Overall, stroke team members reported that CTA and/or CTP aided their clinical management in 39 (47%) cases, including aiding in identification of a nonstroke diagnosis (n = 18), triage to the neurologic intensive care unit (n = 9), early triage to endovascular therapy (n = 4), and initiation of IV thrombolytic for low National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score with large vessel occlusion (n = 3). Door to needle time ≤60 minutes was achieved in only 18% of patients receiving IV thrombolysis during the study period, but had improved to 44% in the subsequent 6-month period.

Yet, the interpretation of PET scans is not clear-cut. The present study aimed at determining the best method to analyse PET/CT in a large, real-life cohort of patients presenting with suspicion of GCA.	One hundred and three patients with clinical suspicion of GCA undergoing PET/CT between 2006 and 2012 were included. Clinical data were retrieved from patients' charts. PET/CT was categorized by visual scoring of the uptake and by the artery/liver standardized uptake values (SUV) ratios. Diagnosis of GCA was confirmed in 68 patients and excluded in 35 patients, which served as the controls. GCA patients were older (median age 75 vs. 68 years), and presented more often with ischaemic symptoms. The best discrimination between GCA patients and controls was achieved for PET/CT findings within the supra-aortic arteries (sensitivity 0.71, specificity 0.91 for a SUV/LE cut-off value of 1.0). Specificity of PET/CT for the aorta and the iliofemoral arteries was lower (<0.34). Visual scoring correlated poorly to SUV measurements (Kendall Tau-b 0.13-0.55) and had a lower diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity 0.77, specificity 0.75). Prednisone treatment for ≥10 days significantly reduced PET/CT sensitivity (P = 0.009).	SUV based analysis of PET/CT enhances diagnostic accuracy with best discrimination in the supra-aortic region, particularly in steroid naïve patients. For discrimination based on the aorta and the iliofemoral region, higher cut-off values have to be applied, resulting in lower sensitivities for diagnosing GCA.",Remaining,0,0
118,23733091,Journal of clinical neurophysiology : official publication of the American Electroencephalographic Society,Best-case kappa scores calculated retrospectively from EEG report databases.,"The most popular metric for interrater reliability in electroencephalography is the kappa (κ) score. κ calculation is laborious, requiring EEG readers to read the same EEG studies. We introduce a method to determine the best-case κ score (κBEST) for measuring interrater reliability between EEG readers, retrospectively.	We incorporated 1 year of EEG reports read by four adult EEG readers at our institution. We used SQL queries to determine EEG findings for subsequent analysis. We generated logistic regression models for particular EEG findings, dependent on patient age, location acuity, and EEG reader. We derived a novel measure, the κBEST statistic, from the logistic regression coefficients.	Increasing patient age and location acuity were associated with decreased sleep and increased diffuse abnormalities. For certain findings, EEG readers exhibited the dominant influence, manifesting directly as lower between-reader κBEST scores for certain EEG findings. Within-reader κBEST control scores were higher than between-reader scores, suggesting internal consistency.	The κBEST metric can measure significant interrater reliability differences between any number of EEG readers and reports, retrospectively, and is generalizable to other domains (e.g., pathology or radiology reporting). We suggest using this metric as a guide or starting point for focused quality control efforts.",Remaining,0,0

One-fifth of these cases of FALS are associated with mutations in copper/zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase (SOD1), but the gene defect in the remaining 80% of familial cases is, as yet, unknown. We have carried out a preliminary genome screen, using a U.K. resource of families lacking SOD1 mutations, to identify other potential disease loci and have identified a putative locus on chromosome 16q12.1-q12.2. The region associated with disease was further refined in the major family that contributed to this result and was localized to D16S409-D16S3032, a 14.74-cM genetic interval that corresponds to a physical distance of 6.6 Mb, which coincides with a region independently identified by two further research groups in the United States and the United Kingdom.",Remaining,0,0

Parents confronted with challenging behavior of their child, may experience less parental-self-efficacy (PSE). Subsequently this lower PSE might strengthen the relationship between low parental support and BPD features.	To increase our understanding of the association between parenting related factors and features of BPD in adolescents.	The sample consisted of 81 adolescents, in the age of 13-21, from a clinical population and their parents. Parents completed (online) questionnaires on parental self-efficacy and adolescents reported on parental support and BPD features.	Adolescents who experienced lower parental support reported more BPD features. Lower parental self-efficacy was not related to BPD features in adolescence, but (more) self-efficacy was related to (older) age. Subsequently no evidence was found for a combined effect of perceived parental support and parental self-efficacy on adolescent BPD features.	Adolescents in a clinical population with higher levels of BPD perceived lower levels of parental support. Parental self-efficacy was not related to levels of BPD. This research is a first step in understanding parenting related factors and BPD features. Longitudinal research is needed to gain more insight in transactions between parenting related factors and symptoms of adolescent BPD.",Remaining,0,0

As a result, it is becoming obvious that the clinical presentation of these smaller lesions can be somewhat variant to what is considered typical for an acoustic neuroma. Likewise, although the sensitivity of auditory brain stem response for larger tumors is believed to be quite good, the sensitivity for smaller tumors has recently been questioned, particularly when the patient is first seen early in the course of the disease with only mild otologic complications. To assess auditory brain stem response results as well as clinical and audiologic presentations, we conducted a retrospective study of patients treated for small acoustic tumors (less than 1 cm). Of the 70 patients included in the study, auditory brain stem response was abnormal in 65 (93%), on the basis of wave V latency prolongation and interaural latency differences. This would indicate that auditory brain stem response is a valid screening test for acoustic tumors, even in early stages of development. The clinical presentation of patients with small acoustic tumors was similar to that reported for acoustic tumors in general, but with vertigo occurring more frequently in patients with smaller tumors. Several atypical patterns of hearing loss were also noted.",Remaining,0,0

124,12244316,Nature genetics,"Mutation of TDP1, encoding a topoisomerase I-dependent DNA damage repair enzyme, in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy.","Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1) repairs covalently bound topoisomerase I-DNA complexes and is essential for preventing the formation of double-strand breaks that result when stalled topoisomerase I complexes interfere with DNA replication in yeast. Here we show that a deficiency of this DNA repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues, but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1) by affecting large, terminally differentiated, non-dividing neuronal cells. Using genome-wide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a Saudi Arabian family affected with autosomal recessive SCAN1, we identified a homozygous mutation in TDP1 (A1478G) that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue. The His493 residue is conserved in TDP1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme. Protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site. We propose that loss-of-function mutations in TDP1 may cause SCAN1 either by interfering with DNA transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons.",Remaining,0,0
125,27138817,Psychiatry research,Psychopathological factors associated with problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in a sample of adolescents in Germany.,"In Germany, high prevalence rates for problematic alcohol use and problematic Internet use in adolescents were reported. The objective of the present study was to identify psychopathological factors associated with these two behavior patterns. To our knowledge, this is the first investigation assessing psychopathological factors for both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use in the same sample of adolescents. We surveyed a sample of 1444 adolescents in Germany regarding problematic alcohol use, problematic Internet use, psychopathology and psychological well-being. We conducted binary logistic regression analyses. 5.6% of the sample showed problematic alcohol use, 4.8% problematic Internet use, and 0.8% both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Problematic alcohol use was higher in adolescents with problematic Internet use compared to those without problematic Internet use. Conduct problems and depressive symptoms were statistically significant associated with both problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use. Prosocial behavior was related to problematic Internet use. Male gender and less peer problems were associated with problematic alcohol use. For the first time associations between adolescent problematic alcohol and problematic Internet use due to common psychopathological factors were identified. However, in addition to shared factors, we found also specific psychopathological correlates associated with these two behavior patterns.",Remaining,0,0

Additionally, IDE hydrolyzes Abeta, glucagon, IGF I and II, and beta-endorphin. We studied the expression of IDE protein in postmortem brains of patients with schizophrenia and controls because: (1) the gene encoding IDE is located on chromosome 10q23-q25, a gene locus linked to schizophrenia; (2) insulin resistance with brain insulin receptor deficits/receptor dysfunction was reported in schizophrenia; (3) the enzyme cleaves IGF-I and IGF-II which are implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease; and (4) brain gamma-endorphin levels, liberated from beta-endorphin exclusively by IDE, have been reported to be altered in schizophrenia. We counted the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the hypothalamic paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and the basal nucleus of Meynert of 14 patients with schizophrenia and 14 matched control cases. Patients had long-term haloperidol treatment. In addition, relative concentrations of IDE protein in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were estimated by Western blot analysis. There was a significantly reduced number of IDE expressing neurons and IDE protein content in the left and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia compared with controls, but not in other brain areas investigated. Results of our studies on the influence of haloperidol on IDE mRNA expression in SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells, as well as the effect of long-term treatment with haloperidol on the number of IDE immunoreactive neurons in rat brain, indicate that haloperidol per se, is not responsible for the decreased neuronal expression of the enzyme in schizophrenics. Haloperidol however, might exert some effect on IDE, through changes of the expression levels of its substrates IGF-I and II, insulin and beta-endorphin. Reduced cortical IDE expression might be part of the disturbed insulin signaling cascades found in schizophrenia. Furthermore, it might contribute to the altered metabolism of certain neuropeptides (IGF-I and IGF-II, beta-endorphin), in schizophrenia.",Remaining,0,0
127,26274986,Journal of neurosurgery,Anatomy and approaches along the cerebellar-brainstem fissures.,"OBJECT Fissure dissection is routinely used in the supratentorial region to access deeply situated pathology while minimizing division of neural tissue. Use of fissure dissection is also practical in the posterior fossa. In this study, the microsurgical anatomy of the 3 cerebellar-brainstem fissures (cerebellomesencephalic, cerebellopontine, and cerebellomedullary) and the various procedures exposing these fissures in brainstem surgery were examined. METHODS Seven cadaveric heads were examined with a microsurgical technique and 3 with fiber dissection to clarify the anatomy of the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures, in which the major vessels and neural structures are located. Several approaches directed along the cerebellar surfaces and fissures, including the supracerebellar infratentorial, occipital transtentorial, retrosigmoid, and midline suboccipital approaches, were examined. The 3 heads examined using fiber dissection defined the anatomy of the cerebellar peduncles coursing in the depths of these fissures. RESULTS Dissections directed along the cerebellar-brainstem and cerebellar fissures provided access to the posterior and posterolateral midbrain and upper pons, lateral pons, floor and lateral wall of the fourth ventricle, and dorsal and lateral medulla. CONCLUSIONS Opening the cerebellar-brainstem and adjacent cerebellar fissures provided access to the brainstem surface hidden by the cerebellum, while minimizing division of neural tissue. Most of the major cerebellar arteries, veins, and vital neural structures are located in or near these fissures and can be accessed through them.",Remaining,0,0

A cross-sectional comparative study of 20 patients with PD and 20 age-matched healthy controls was conducted. Visual acuity, color vision, contrast sensitivity, visual fields, pattern visual-evoked response (VER), and multifocal electroretinogram were recorded to determine functional change, whereas structural changes were evaluated with retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, macular thickness, macular volume, and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer complex (GCL-IPL) thickness using spectral domain ocular coherence tomography (SD-OCT).	PD patients ranged from Stage 1-3, with median Stage 2 (Hoehn and Yahr Classification) with mean Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale III score of 19 ± 10.42, and average disease duration of 5.8 ± 2.78 years. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields were unaffected but contrast sensitivity was significantly worse than controls (P < 0.001). Multifocal electroretinogram values in the central 2° field revealed decreased foveal electrical activity, with increased pattern VER amplitude and latency. Significant RNFL thinning was observed in the average RNFL (P = 0.033), superior (P = 0.018), and temporal (P = 0.036) quadrants. Significant ganglion cell layer loss was captured on SD-OCT with average, minimum GCL-IPL, and all 6 sectors showing thinning (P ≤ 0.003). The functional changes correlated significantly with structural changes, disease duration, and severity. There was no correlation between structural changes in the retina and disease duration or severity.

In the first follow-up series, borderline psychopathology was associated with higher levels of psychiatric service use (emergency, daycare, and inpatient). Markov analyses indicated that the transition between levels of psychiatric service use followed a stationary, second order process (i.e. the immediate past and current service use, predicted use on the next follow-up, and the relationship did not depend on the point in time examined in the follow-up series). Further, the transition probabilities generated from this model did not depend significantly on diagnosis. Predictions from the Markov model about the cumulative probability that subjects would use the highest level of psychiatric services were tested on a second series of follow-ups on the same subjects 20 months later. The model-based predictions (starting from the observed levels in the first two follow-ups of the second series) clustered into three groups, of high, middle, and low predicted probabilities. The subject group with the lowest predicted likelihood had a cumulative probability of 0.19 for using emergency, daycare, or inpatient hospitalization by 22 months of follow-up, whereas the group with the highest likelihood (containing a disproportionate number of BPD subjects) had a cumulative observed probability of 0.80. The Markov model generated from this second series supported the stationarity of the transition process. BPD subjects began using high levels of psychiatric services, but their transition from one level to another over time followed a process similar to that of non-BPD subjects.",Remaining,0,0

Alcoholic men (n = 43) and women (n = 21) who responded to notices about a research study were screened, clinically assessed and administered Wechsler Memory and Intelligence tests after 3 months of sobriety, on average. Cognitive performance was compared with that of an age-matched sample of healthy controls (n = 51).	As a group, the alcoholics achieved significantly lower scores than controls on summary indices of the Wechsler Memory and Adult Intelligence Scales and showed greater decline from estimated premorbid intelligence levels than controls. Almost 60% of the alcoholics had at least one additional psychiatric (mood or anxiety) or past substance-dependence comorbidity. There were no marked sex differences in patterns of comorbidity. Comorbid alcoholics were younger, had consumed less alcohol over their lifetime and performed between noncomorbid alcoholics and controls on all tests.	Mood and anxiety comorbidity did not necessarily compound poor cognitive test performance associated with chronic alcohol misuse.

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) and habituation of the startle reflex are operational measures of early information processing. Impaired PPI in schizophrenia has been replicated in many studies and is regarded as an endophenotype for schizophrenia. However, reports on the stability of PPI over a longer period of time are lacking, both for patients with schizophrenia and for healthy subjects. The current study examined 25 initially drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients and 23 healthy matched controls. Three PPI measures [stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) 30, 60, 120 ms] and habituation were assessed at baseline, and again after 6 yr. Sixteen patients and 17 healthy controls completed the study, and 13 patients and 17 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The schizophrenia patients had PPI deficits compared to controls at baseline. After 6 yr, no significant group differences were found. PPI had increased significantly in the patients and had decreased significantly in controls. In addition, patients showed significantly less habituation than controls while habituation did not change in patients or controls. The present results show that PPI in drug-naive, first-episode schizophrenia patients can improve significantly over time. As PPI increased in patients over the same period that it decreased in controls, it is likely that the increase was caused by disease-related factors such as disease process, clinical state, or medication.",Remaining,0,0
135,16850255,Metabolic brain disease,Neurocircuitry of disgust and anxiety in obsessive-compulsive disorder: a positron emission tomography study.,"Disgust and fear are basic emotions that have different elicitors and expressions, and that appear to be mediated by different neurocircuits. Although obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is classified as an anxiety disorder, disgust may be involved in its pathogenesis. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of disgust-inducing visual stimuli in OCD have suggested disorder specific alterations in brain activation during these tasks.	Subjects with OCD and healthy controls (HC) underwent positron emission tomography (PET) brain scanning after injection of H(2) (15)O. During PET, subjects either watched slides designed to evoke feelings of disgust (OCD = 5, HC = 11), expected the delivery of an electrical shock (OCD = 11, HC = 13), or rested (OCD = 11, HC = 14). After the anticipatory anxiety and resting tasks, anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal measures were obtained. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) was used to analyze regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) data.	Comparison of OCD subjects with controls on differences in rCBF across the disgust-inducing and resting tasks showed that OCD was characterized by greater rCBF in the left insula. In OCD the disgust-inducing task increased right lateral orbitofrontal cortex rCBF compared to resting, whereas in controls there was no difference in rCBF between these tasks. Anxiety ratings, heart rate, and electrodermal activity increased during anticipatory anxiety in both groups, and comparison of rCBF in OCD subjects with controls in anticipatory anxiety versus resting state also found no significant differences.	OCD may be characterized by a disruption in disgust processing, such that there is a decrease in appropriate disgust (such as that evoked by observing disgust in others) and an increase in inappropriate disgust (such as that evoked by contamination stimuli). The insula may play a particularly important role in mediating such putative disruptions. The sample studied here was small, and further work is required to determine whether disgust-induced activation patterns in OCD are more apparent in specific subtypes of this disorder, whether they are specific to OCD, and whether they are normalized by treatment.",Remaining,0,0

137,28128654,European journal of preventive cardiology,Burden of carotid artery atherosclerosis in Chinese adults: Implications for future risk of cardiovascular diseases.,"Background Population-based studies of ultrasound measures of carotid atherosclerosis are informative about future risks of cardiovascular disease. Design Cross-sectional studies of carotid artery atherosclerosis in 24,822 Chinese adults from the China Kadoorie Biobank and 2579 Europeans from the UK Biobank. Methods Mean intima-media thickness of the common carotid arteries and presence of carotid artery plaque were examined in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. The carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) findings in Chinese (mean age 59 years) were compared with a European population (mean age 62 years). Results Overall, the mean cIMT in Chinese was 0.70 mm (SD 0.16) and increased with age by 0.08 mm (SE 0.008) per 10-years older age. About 31% of the Chinese had carotid plaques and the prevalence varied 10-fold with age (6% at 40-49 to 63% at 70-89 years) and four-fold by region (range, 14%-57%). After adjustment for age, sex and region, plaque prevalence was higher in smokers than in non-smokers (36% vs. 28%) and two-fold higher in individuals with systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg than those with systolic blood pressure <120 mmHg (44% vs. 22%) in the China Kadoorie Biobank study. Mean cIMT was similar in the younger Chinese and European adults, but increased more steeply with age in the Chinese (p = 0.002). Conclusions About one-third of Chinese adults had carotid plaques. The rate of progression of carotid atherosclerosis with age was more extreme in the Chinese compared with the European population, highlighting the need for more intensive strategies for cardiovascular disease prevention in China.",Remaining,0,0
138,36078361,International journal of environmental research and public health,Workplace Bullying and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Symptomology: The Influence of Role Conflict and the Moderating Effects of Neuroticism and Managerial Competencies.,"Research has explored numerous consequences of workplace bullying, including a recent link to the exhibition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology. Role conflict as a workplace stressor may contribute to instances of bullying from a passive perspective, which may lead to PTSD symptomology in victims. What remains less explored is if role conflict has a direct relationship to PTSD symptomology and how personality traits such as neuroticism and workplace factors such as managerial competencies may moderate the stress brought on by role conflict. Hence the present study seeks to examine this gap in the literature. This study utilizes a between-subjects, cross-sectional design with 159 participants, 39.6% male and 60.4% female. Most participants (60%) were Italian workers of a large social cooperative organization. Confirmatory factor analysis indicated that the measurement model was valid and had an adequate model fit. Results from two separate moderated mediation analyses found a positive, full mediation between the independent variable of role conflict, the mediator of exposure to bullying, and the dependent variable of PTSD symptomology. Furthermore, in this study, neuroticism strengthened the indirect effect while managerial competencies weakened it. The results highlight the importance of training competent managers and providing resources for more vulnerable employees to moderate employee work stress and its negative outcomes.",Remaining,0,0
139,21669013,Journal of child language,Individual differences in pronoun reversal: evidence from two longitudinal case studies.,"Pronoun reversal, the use of you for self-reference and I for an addressee, has often been associated with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and impaired language. However, recent case studies have shown the phenomenon also to occur in typically developing and even precocious talkers. This study examines longitudinal corpus data from two children, a typically developing girl, and a boy with Asperger's syndrome. Both were precocious talkers who reversed the majority of their personal pronouns for several months. A comparison of the children's behaviors revealed quantitative and qualitative differences in pronoun use: the girl showed 'semantic confusion', using second person pronouns for self-reference, whereas the boy showed a discourse-pragmatic deficit related to perspective-taking. The results suggest that there are multiple mechanisms underlying pronoun reversal and provide qualified support for both the Name/Person Hypothesis (Clark, 1978; Charney, 1980b) and the Plurifunctional Pronoun Hypothesis (Chiat, 1982).",Remaining,0,0

To generate and cross-validate a blood-based screener for AD that yields acceptable accuracy across both serum and plasma.	Analysis of serum biomarker proteins were conducted on 197 Alzheimer's disease (AD) participants and 199 control participants from the Texas Alzheimer's Research Consortium (TARC) with further analysis conducted on plasma proteins from 112 AD and 52 control participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The full algorithm was derived from a biomarker risk score, clinical lab (glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol, homocysteine), and demographic (age, gender, education, APOE*E4 status) data.	Alzheimer's disease.	11 proteins met our criteria and were utilized for the biomarker risk score. The random forest (RF) biomarker risk score from the TARC serum samples (training set) yielded adequate accuracy in the ADNI plasma sample (training set) (AUC = 0.70, sensitivity (SN) = 0.54 and specificity (SP) = 0.78), which was below that obtained from ADNI cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analyses (t-tau/Aβ ratio AUC = 0.92). However, the full algorithm yielded excellent accuracy (AUC = 0.88, SN = 0.75, and SP = 0.91). The likelihood ratio of having AD based on a positive test finding (LR+) = 7.03 (SE = 1.17; 95% CI = 4.49-14.47), the likelihood ratio of not having AD based on the algorithm (LR-) = 3.55 (SE = 1.15; 2.22-5.71), and the odds ratio of AD were calculated in the ADNI cohort (OR) = 28.70 (1.55; 95% CI = 11.86-69.47).

141,8825886,American journal of medical genetics,Sensory gating deficits in parents of schizophrenics.,"Although schizophrenia clusters in families, it is not inherited in Mendelian fashion. This suggests that there may be alternative phenotypic expressions of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia, such as more elementary physiological or biochemical defects. One proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli. Normally, the amplitude of the P50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first, but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia. Clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype. We have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory P50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families. In 11, there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness, in addition to the schizophrenic proband. All of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the P50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring, whereas only 7% of the parents without family history had gating of the P50 response in the abnormal range. These results support loss of gating of the auditory P50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia.",Remaining,0,0

A secondary aim was to use the emerging themes in service planning and to develop an evaluation tool. Focus groups and individual interviews with women in receipt of psychiatric services in Croydon were used. The findings suggest continuity with both negative and positive aspects of institutional care described before the policy of community care was introduced. The attempts to 'normalize' institutional care by desegregating wards appear rather to have compounded problems faced by women. Women were clear about what they felt they wanted and needed. Women are dissatisfied about many aspects of care aside from the problems associated specifically with mixed sex wards. This suggests that sexual segregation of wards alone is a necessary but an insufficient measure to improve inpatient care. The findings can inform development of a women-only service in Croydon and of a tool to evaluate it.,Remaining,0,0

A baseline sample of 1195 13-year-old pupils was from 22 randomly selected schools in the Hordaland County in western Norway. Latent class growth analysis revealed three developmental trajectories. The first trajectory was a conventional trajectory, comprising 36.3% of participants, who showed changes in smoking, physical exercise, fruit intake, and drunkenness consistent with the prevailing age specific norms of these behaviors in the Norwegian society at the time. The second trajectory was a passive trajectory, comprising 25.5% of participants, who reported low levels of both healthy and unhealthy behaviors during the 17-year period. The third trajectory was an unhealthy trajectory, comprising 38.2% of participants, who had high levels of unhealthy behaviors over time. Several covariates were examined, but only sex and mother's and father's educational levels were found to be significantly associated with the identified trajectories. While these findings need to be replicated in future studies, the identification of the different trajectories suggests the need to tailor intervention according to specific needs.",Remaining,0,0

To assess patient preferences for discussing traumatic experiences and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with clinicians in underserved, predominantly Latino primary care patients.	Cross-sectional study.	We evaluated patients with a questionnaire assessing comfort to discuss trauma exposure and symptoms using the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study questionnaire and the Primary Care-PTSD screen. The questionnaire also assessed patients' confidence in their clinicians' ability to help with trauma-related issues. Surveys were collected at an integrated medical and behavioral health care clinic.	Of 178 adult patients asked, 152 (83%) agreed to participate. Among participants, 37% screened positive for PTSD, 42% reported 4 or more ACEs, and 26% had elevated scores on both measures. Primary Care-PTSD and ACE scores were strongly positively correlated (r = 0.57, p < 0.001). Most patients agreed they were comfortable being asked about trauma directly or through screening questionnaires and did not oppose the inclusion of trauma-related information in their medical record. In addition, most patients perceived their clinician as comfortable asking questions about childhood trauma and able to address trauma-related problems.	Screening is acceptable to most primary care patients regardless of trauma exposure or positive PTSD screening. Findings may aid primary care clinicians to consider screening regularly for ACEs and PTSD to better serve the health care needs of trauma-exposed patients.",Remaining,0,0

149,30875614,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior,Early prediction of long-term tactile object recognition performance after sensorimotor stroke.,"Until now tactile agnosia has been reported only in small, but detailed cross-sectional case studies. Here we show that multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) of early diffusion-weighted lesion maps can be used to accurately predict long-term recovery of tactile object recognition (TOR) in 35 subjects with varying hand skill impairment and associated specific daily activity limitation after cortical sensori-motor stroke. Multiple regression analysis revealed the essentially dysfunctional subprocesses for object recognition in the specifically impaired subjects, i.e., grasping as determined by a subtest of Jebsen Taylor hand function test, and perception of macrogeometrical object properties. The Gaussian process regression of MVPA represents a function that relates a selection of lesioned voxels as input variables to TOR performance scores as target variables. On the behavioural level, patients fell into three recovery subgroups, depending on TOR performance over the observation period. Only baseline motor hand skill and shape discrimination were significantly correlated with the TOR trajectories. To define functionally meaningful voxels, we combined information from MVPA of lesion maps and a priori knowledge of regions of interest derived from a data bank for shape recognition. A high significance for the predicted TOR performances over nine months could be verified by permutation tests, leading us to expect that the model generalises to larger patient cohorts with first cortical ischemic stroke. The lesion sites of the persistently impaired subjects exhibited an overlap with critical areas related to the MVPA prediction map in the cytoarchitectonic areas PFt of inferior parietal lobule and OP1 of parietal operculum which are associated with higher order sensory processing. This ultimate check corroborated the significance of the MVPA map for the prediction of tactile object recognition. The clinical implication of our study is that neuroimaging data acquired immediately after first stroke could facilitate individual forecasting of post-stroke recovery.",Remaining,0,0

This study aimed to ascertain if teachers observed less psychological symptoms in Bangladeshi than British children.	Teachers completed a Rutter B2 Scale on samples of 113 'Bangladeshi' and 61 British children aged between 5 and 11 years.	Teachers recognised less symptomatology in the Asian children than their British peers. This trend was significant in children under the age of 8, but there was no significant difference in those aged 8-11 years. Only 13% of Bangladeshi children were fully fluent in English.	Two alternate hypotheses are put forward to explain these findings: (a) because more of the younger children could not speak English and communicate freely with their teachers, their symptoms were not noted by teachers; (b) the symptoms of the older children were a response to the pressures both the children and families faced as new immigrants. This study clearly needs to be replicated with a larger sample and also with interviews with both children and parents in order to validate the Rutter B2 questionnaires as an appropriate measure of disturbance in Bangladeshi children. It should be replicated with validated assessments of the children's fluency in English. It is also important to discuss with Bangladeshi parents what support they would like from both the school and from child psychiatric services, to promote their children's psychological health.",Remaining,0,0
152,29155708,Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,Enrichment of Detergent-insoluble Protein Aggregates from Human Postmortem Brain.,"In this study, we describe an abbreviated single-step fractionation protocol for the enrichment of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates from human postmortem brain. The ionic detergent N-lauryl-sarcosine (sarkosyl) effectively solubilizes natively folded proteins in brain tissue allowing the enrichment of detergent-insoluble protein aggregates from a wide range of neurodegenerative proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and prion diseases. Human control and AD postmortem brain tissues were homogenized and sedimented by ultracentrifugation in the presence of sarkosyl to enrich detergent-insoluble protein aggregates including pathologic phosphorylated tau, the core component of neurofibrillary tangles in AD. Western blotting demonstrated the differential solubility of aggregated phosphorylated-tau and the detergent-soluble protein, Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) in control and AD brain. Proteomic analysis also revealed enrichment of β-amyloid (Aβ), tau, snRNP70 (U1-70K), and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in the sarkosyl-insoluble fractions of AD brain compared to those of control, consistent with previous tissue fractionation strategies. Thus, this simple enrichment protocol is ideal for a wide range of experimental applications ranging from Western blotting and functional protein co-aggregation assays to mass spectrometry-based proteomics.",Remaining,0,0

To assess the relation between intra-individual variability of systolic orthostatic blood pressure change (DeltaSBP) and cardiovascular outcomes, an algorithm was developed to identify DeltaSBP instability using repeated supine and standing BP measurements. A cohort of 673 nursing home residents underwent baseline postural BP measurements (supine to 1 minute of standing, four times in a single day) and were followed for up to 2 years. Two groups (stable vs. unstable) were identified based on an analysis of DeltaSBP variance components. Differences in outcomes were compared via Cox survival analysis. At baseline 12.6% were unstable, defined as a one standard deviation difference of at least 20.2 mmHg between DeltaSBP readings. Unstable subjects were more likely to have OH on at least one measurement (systolic BP drop of 20 mmHg or more; 85% vs. 36%, respectively) and to be on psychotropic medication at baseline (47% vs 35%) (P-values <0.001). Other characteristics (including previous stroke) did not differ. During a mean follow-up of 10.3 months, stroke incidence was higher in unstable subjects (13.1% vs. 4.9%; P = 0.012), but ischemic heart disease and mortality rates were not significantly different (respectively, 13.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.115; 14.8% vs. 10.7%, P = 0.178). Survival analyses (adjusted for age, sex, psychotropic medications, body mass index, ischemic heart disease, and supine systolic pressure) confirmed a higher risk of stroke in unstable subjects (relative risk = 3.7, 95% CI: 1.6-8.4). Highly variable orthostatic BP measures may reflect impaired BP regulatory mechanisms in elders with occult cerebrovascular disease, or may directly affect cerebral blood flow. Orthostatic BP variability may be a better indicator of future stroke than a single supine or orthostatic change measure.",Remaining,0,0

We conducted a time-stratified case-crossover study of 1000,014 CVD deaths in Jiangsu province, China during 2015-2019 using data from the China National Mortality Surveillance System. Residential daily 24-hour average temperature for each subject was extracted from a validated grid data at a spatial resolution of 0.0625° × 0.0625°. We fitted distributed lag non-linear models (DLNM) based on conditional logistic regression to quantitatively investigate the association of ambient temperature with total and cause-specific CVD mortality, which was used to further estimate mortality burden attributable to non-optimum ambient temperatures.	With adjustment for relative humidity, we observed reverse J-shaped exposure-response associations of ambient temperature with total and cause-specific CVD mortality, with minimum mortality temperatures ranging from 19.5 °C to 23.0 °C. An estimated 20.3% of the total CVD deaths were attributable to non-optimum temperatures, while the attributable fraction (AF) of mortality from chronic rheumatic heart diseases, hypertensive diseases, ischemic heart diseases (IHD), pulmonary heart disease, stroke, and sequelae of stroke was 22.4%, 23.2%, 23.3%, 20.9%, 17.6% and 21.3%, respectively.

Because glutamate receptor genes are excellent candidates for psychiatric disorders, we have investigated the physical distance of this gene from the translocation breakpoint on chromosome 11. We have shown that the mGluR5a gene lies at least 850 kb from the breakpoint and, hence, cannot be directly disrupted in translocation carriers. However, a long range position effect of the translocation on this gene, or co-segregation of the translocation with a mutant allele of mGluR5a cannot be ruled out.",Remaining,0,0

The Bruneck Study is a prospective population-based survey on the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In 826 men and women 40 to 79 years old (1990 baseline), 5-year changes in carotid atherosclerosis were thoroughly assessed by high-resolution duplex scanning. The presence of chronic respiratory, urinary tract, dental, and other infections was ascertained by standard diagnostic criteria. Chronic infections amplified the risk of atherosclerosis development in the carotid arteries. The association was most pronounced in subjects free of carotid atherosclerosis at baseline (age-/sex-adjusted odds ratio [95% CI] for any chronic infection versus none, 4.08 [2.42 to 6.85]; P:<0.0001) and applied to all types of chronic (bacterial) infections. It remained independently significant after adjustment for classic vascular risk attributes and extended to low-risk individuals free of conventional risk factors. Among subjects with chronic infections, atherosclerosis risk was highest in those with a prominent inflammatory response. Markers of systemic inflammation, such as soluble adhesion molecules and circulating bacterial endotoxin, and levels of soluble human heat-shock protein 60 and antibodies to mycobacterial heat-shock protein 65 were elevated in subjects with chronic infections and predictive of an increased risk of atherosclerosis.

Plasma leptin started to decrease at 24 h of fasting in the SCI group, whereas plasma leptin started to decrease at 12 h of fasting in the AB group. The current study demonstrated that plasma leptin decreased with fasting in both SCI and AB groups, with the leptin decrease being delayed in the SCI group. The delayed leptin response to fasting in the SCI group may be because of increased fat mass (%body fat, SCI: 33.8 +/- 3.0, AB: 24.1 +/- 2.9) and sympathetic nervous system dysfunction.",Remaining,0,0

Participants were 6 nurses and 7 nursing technicians working in emergency and hospitalization. Data collection was performed using semi-structured interviews and organized into thematic categories. Participants considered psychiatric emergencies as situations that may threat their own lives or that of others. The emergency characteristics they mentioned were: aggressive and agitated behavior, suicide attempt and substance abuse. The first impression of the patient's behavior and an attempt to have conversation determine the conducts adopted by the professionals. They recognize their difficulty and lack of preparation to approach the patient. In conclusion, there is a need for permanent education on new services and for adjustments to existing services for care in this area.",Remaining,0,0

A sample consisting of 618 adolescents, aged from 13 to 17 years, completed a questionnaire assessing EA, exercise characteristics (i.e., frequency and intensity of exercise), depression, body image (i.e., body appreciation and social physique anxiety), and disordered eating (i.e., concerns about eating and body weight gain as well as restrictive and compensatory practices).	The profile analysis identified three EA profiles, which were labelled: low-risk, high-risk with conflict and high-risk without conflict. Based on their scores for the health-related variables considered, the low-risk profile emerged as the least problematic; this increasing in the high-risk without conflict and even more so in the high-risk with conflict profiles. Nevertheless, individuals belonging to the high-risk without conflict profile showed similar body appreciation scores but lower social physique anxiety scores than those belonging to the low-risk profile.	The study is limited by both its cross-sectional design and the self-reported nature of the collected data.	Conflict symptom may be relevant in explaining the differences in certain health-related variables between adolescents showing similarly high levels of EA.",Remaining,0,0

This study determines the utility of outcome measures obtained from an instrumented wrist rig for future rehabilitation trials. The tests undertaken were evaluated in terms of sensitivity to detect differences between normal and impaired participants, test-retest repeatability (repeatability coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC]), and interrater agreement (Bland and Altman limits of agreement).	Twelve participants with chronic poststroke hemiparesis (mean 5.6 years); and 12 unimpaired volunteers performed a series of tasks in the rig. The hemiparetic arm (impaired group) and dominant arm (unimpaired group) were tested in 3 sessions on the same day by 2 assessors. Signals were analyzed to derive a tracking index (motor control), stretch index (spasticity), flexor modulation index (FMI) (muscle activation), force angle index (FAI) (stiffness), range of movement, and isometric force.	The means of all tests differed between impaired and unimpaired participants except for range of movement into flexion, the FAI, and the FMI. Repeatability coefficients for each test are presented as benchmark values for use in future trials in which the wrist rig tests may be used to detect change. Test-retest reliability was excellent in the impaired group (ICC = 0.88-0.98) and poor to excellent in the unimpaired group (ICC = 0.06-0.89). The Bland-Altman ranges showed no bias between assessors, and that the interassessor variability was similar to that between repeats by the same assessor for most tests.",Remaining,0,0

QOL was evaluated in a sample of 57 nondialysis patients with CKD using the 36-item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire comprising 8 scales, including the physical component summary and mental component summary measures. Depression and anxiety were estimated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively.	Depression and anxiety scores were negatively correlated with 7 of the 8 scales of the Short Form 36 questionnaire, and with the physical component summary and mental component summary scores, despite 38.6% patients with depression and 54.4% with anxiety, whereas QOL in the depression group, the anxiety group, and the anxiety and depression comorbid group was lower than that for those without the corresponding psychiatric disorders (P < 0.05).	This study demonstrates that depression and anxiety, commonly encountered in patients with CKD, could be a risk factor for QOL in these patients.",Remaining,0,0

In a real-time prediction scenario, a machine learning model may receive limited information for some patients.	Our aim was to evaluate the influence of missing data on real-time prediction of delirium, and detect changes in prediction performance when training separate models for patients with missing data.	We compared a model trained specifically on data with missing values to the currently implemented model predicting delirium. Also, we simulated five test data sets with different amount of missing data and compared the prediction results to the prediction on complete data set when using the same model.	For patients with missing laboratory and nursing assessment data, a model trained especially for this scenario performed significantly better than the implemented model. The combination of procedure data and demographic data achieved the closest results to a prediction with a complete data set.	An ongoing evaluation of real-time prediction is indispensable.

We performed a retrospective study, identifying all patients admitted with burns sustained during an epileptic seizure within a period of six years.	Totally 7 women with an average age of 45 years were enrolled in this retrospective study. Mean BSAB was 2.4% (range 0.5-6). All burns occurred in a domestic setting during household activities (cooking, ironing). Thermal injury included contact burn (6 patients with deep burns), followed by scald (one patient with superficial burns). 6 of 7 patients (85%) required excision of deep burns and skin grafting procedure. The average duration of hospital stay was 13 days. Collected data were compared with the results and findings of similar studies and analysed. A list of preventive measures is included.	Patients with epilepsy should be informed about all potential threats at the time of neurological diagnosis including also the risk of serious burn injury, which should be emphasised.",Remaining,0,0
170,423003,Journal of neurosurgery,Cerebral hemodynamic changes during plateau waves in brain-tumor patients.,"The plateau wave, one of the wave forms observed in patients with increased intracranial pressure, has previously been extensively investigated, but its pathophysiological aspect is as yet unclear. The authors undertook a study of cerebral hemodynamic changes while the plateau waves were observed in five brain-tumor patients. Although the number of cases studied was small, a remarkable decrease in cerebrovascular resistance was seen in all patients during the plateau waves. It is suggested that the plateau waves are caused by a marked cerebral vasodilatation. The present results support the thesis that cerebral blood volume is increased during the plateau waves. The plateau waves are closely related to the intrinsic vasomotor control of cerebral circulation, and can occur as long as cerebral vasodilating ability is maintained, irrespective of the existence of cerebral autoregulation.",Remaining,0,0
171,32665027,Acta neuropathologica communications,The unfolded protein response is activated in the olfactory system in Alzheimer's disease.,"Olfactory dysfunction is an early and prevalent symptom of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the olfactory bulb is a nexus of beta-amyloid plaque and tau neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology during early AD progression. To mitigate the accumulation of misfolded proteins, an endoplasmic reticulum stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) occurs in the AD hippocampus. However, chronic UPR activation can lead to apoptosis and the upregulation of beta-amyloid and tau production. Therefore, UPR activation in the olfactory system could be one of the first changes in AD. In this study, we investigated whether two proteins that signal UPR activation are expressed in the olfactory system of AD cases with low or high amounts of aggregate pathology. We used immunohistochemistry to label two markers of UPR activation (p-PERK and p-eIF2α) concomitantly with neuronal markers (NeuN and PGP9.5) and pathology markers (beta-amyloid and tau) in the olfactory bulb, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in AD and normal cases. We show that UPR activation, as indicated by p-PERK and p-eIF2α expression, is significantly increased throughout the olfactory system in AD cases with low (Braak stage III-IV) and high-level (Braak stage V-VI) pathology. We further show that UPR activation occurs in the mitral cells and in the anterior olfactory nucleus of the olfactory bulb where tau and amyloid pathology is abundant. However, UPR activation is not present in neurons when they contain NFTs and only rarely occurs in neurons containing diffuse tau aggregates. We conclude that UPR activation is prevalent in all regions of the olfactory system and support previous findings suggesting that UPR activation likely precedes NFT formation. Our data indicate that chronic UPR activation in the olfactory system might contribute to the olfactory dysfunction that occurs early in the pathogenesis of AD.",Remaining,0,0

This study aims to investigate the impact of atrial fibrillation on patients with diagnosed peripheral arterial disease.	This is a retrospective study using The Health Improvement Network database, which contains prospectively collected data from participating primary care practices. Patients with a new diagnosis of peripheral arterial disease between January 8, 1995 and January 5, 2017 were identified in the database alongside relevant demographic information, clinical history, and medications. Every patient in the dataset with peripheral arterial disease and baseline atrial fibrillation (case) was matched to a patient without atrial fibrillation (control) with similar characteristics using propensity score matching. Cox-regression analysis was performed and hazard ratios (HR) calculated for the outcomes of death, stroke, ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and major amputation.	Prevalence of atrial fibrillation in this cohort was 10.2%. All patients with peripheral arterial disease and atrial fibrillation (n = 5685) were matched with 5685 patients without atrial fibrillation but otherwise similar characteristics. After multivariate analysis, atrial fibrillation was independently associated with mortality (HR 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.26; P < .01), cerebrovascular events (HR 1.35; 95% CI, 1.17-1.57; P < .01), and heart failure (HR 1.87; 95% CI, 1.62-2.15; P < .01), but not with ischemic heart disease or limb loss.	In peripheral arterial disease patients, atrial fibrillation is a risk factor for mortality, stroke, and heart failure. This emphasizes the need for proactive surveillance and holistic management of these patients.",Remaining,0,0
173,27180681,Scientific reports,Cancer-associated DDX3X mutations drive stress granule assembly and impair global translation.,"DDX3X is a DEAD-box RNA helicase that has been implicated in multiple aspects of RNA metabolism including translation initiation and the assembly of stress granules (SGs). Recent genomic studies have reported recurrent DDX3X mutations in numerous tumors including medulloblastoma (MB), but the physiological impact of these mutations is poorly understood. Here we show that a consistent feature of MB-associated mutations is SG hyper-assembly and concomitant translation impairment. We used CLIP-seq to obtain a comprehensive assessment of DDX3X binding targets and ribosome profiling for high-resolution assessment of global translation. Surprisingly, mutant DDX3X expression caused broad inhibition of translation that impacted DDX3X targeted and non-targeted mRNAs alike. Assessment of translation efficiency with single-cell resolution revealed that SG hyper-assembly correlated precisely with impaired global translation. SG hyper-assembly and translation impairment driven by mutant DDX3X were rescued by a genetic approach that limited SG assembly and by deletion of the N-terminal low complexity domain within DDX3X. Thus, in addition to a primary defect at the level of translation initiation caused by DDX3X mutation, SG assembly itself contributes to global translation inhibition. This work provides mechanistic insights into the consequences of cancer-related DDX3X mutations, suggesting that globally reduced translation may provide a context-dependent survival advantage that must be considered as a possible contributor to tumorigenesis.",Remaining,0,0
174,7771669,"Alcoholism, clinical and experimental research",The Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale: a self-rated instrument for the quantification of thoughts about alcohol and drinking behavior.,"It has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol 'craving' includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking. An interview-based rating scale, the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-heavy drinkers (YBOCS-hd), has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcohol-dependent individuals. A self-rating scale, the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS) has been developed by us as a modification of the YBOCS-hd. The YBOCS-hd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands. The correlation between the YBOCS-hd and the OCDS total scores obtained on 60 alcohol-dependent individuals was 0.83. The test-retest correlation for the OCDS total score was 0.96, and the obsessive and compulsive subscales test-retest correlations were 0.94 and 0.86, respectively. The internal consistency of the items in the OCDS was high (0.86) and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items. The shared variance between the OCDS scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20%, indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking. As such, it might act as an independent measure of the 'state of illness' for alcohol-dependent individuals. When used during a prospective 12-week treatment research study, initial results indicate that the OCDS seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence, because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinking.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",Remaining,0,0

Students worked in interprofessional teams to plan and implement a social skills training program for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The objectives were to provide a hands-on, student-led clinical experience; facilitate interprofessional collaborative learning through leadership partnerships and teach children with ASD to engage in appropriate social skill behaviors. Concurrently, faculty performed qualitative research to explore how the students worked together to provide intervention to the children. Data were collected via interview, direct observation of student planning sessions and student interprofessional interactions, and collection of posts from an online social network site used for session planning. There were six student participants and two faculty participants. Four themes emerged: learning who I am as a professional, learning to appreciate our professional differences, learning to communicate with each other and figuring it out, for the benefit of the kids. This interprofessional clinical learning experience and research helps ensure that students are adequately prepared to represent their profession as part of a diverse interprofessional health care team.",Remaining,0,0

Previously, the decreased C4b-binding protein (C4BP), a potent circulating soluble inhibitor of the classical and lectin pathways of complement, was reported to be associated with risk of schizophrenia. Here, we analyzed 4 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of C4BPB and 5 SNPs of C4BPA in a group of 556 schizophrenia patients and a matched group of 610 healthy controls to see if the genes C4BPB and C4BPA, which encode C4BP, may confer a susceptibility to schizophrenia. Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of those SNPs between cases and controls, we found no association between the C4BPB/C4BPA variants and schizophrenia. Our results provided preliminary evidence that C4BPB/C4BPA may not confer susceptibility to schizophrenia among Han Chinese. Further genetic studies from large-scale population are required to obtain more conclusive results.",Remaining,0,0

NTD is associated with impaired folate metabolism. We investigated whether schizophrenia is also linked with a dysfunctional folate metabolism. In addition to the prevalence of the 677C-->T mutation in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, we compared plasma and red blood cell (RBC) folate, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and homocysteine (Hcy) concentrations of 35 schizophrenic patients with those of 104 unrelated controls. Schizophrenic patients had significantly lower plasma folate concentrations after adjustment for Hcy levels, and elevated RBC folate levels compared to controls. Vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and Hcy levels did not differ from control values. Plasma folate levels below the 10th percentile of controls were associated with an approximate 4-7-fold (before and after adjustment of folate levels for Hcy, respectively) risk of having schizophrenia. In addition, a significant dose-response relation between plasma folate concentrations and risk for schizophrenia suggested a protective effect by high plasma folate concentrations. Elevated Hcy levels and, in line with this finding, homozygosity for the 677C-->T mutation in the MTHFR gene were not associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia. Evidence is presented suggesting that folate metabolism is disturbed in schizophrenic patients, independently of Hcy.",Remaining,0,0

Blood DNA from 80 control individuals and 118 age-matched Parkinson's disease patients were analyzed for NQO2 gene promoter polymorphisms. The results revealed three allelic variants, designated I-29, I-16, and D. These results were confirmed in fibroblast cell lines. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there was a significant increase in the frequency of the D allele, but there was no difference in the frequency of the alleles in familial compared to sporadic Parkinson's disease. The D and I-16 promoters direct higher NQO2 gene expression that results in higher enzyme activity. Overexpression of NQO2 in the catecholaminergic neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells resulted in increased production of reactive oxygen species when exposed to exogenous dopamine. The results suggest that the association of the D promoter with Parkinson's disease may be due to an increase in expression of the NQO2 gene.",Remaining,0,0

A case-control study.,"Experience in practice has suggested that children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) tend to have higher numbers of diseased, missing and filled teeth (DMFT score) than children without the condition. To date, however, this impression has not been systematically investigated. A case-control study of children in Otago, New Zealand (case DMFT > or = 5; control DMFT <5; case status determined from School Dental Service dental records) was conducted by postal survey and reference to the School Dental Service records.

During a 4-year period, we systematically collected the clinical and polysomnographic variables for all women referred for sleep complaints using preestablished questionnaires, scales, clinical grid, polygraphic montage, and scoring criteria. The variables collected on premenopausal SDB women were analyzed and compared to those of postmenopausal women within 5 years of menopause.	Of 977 women, 316 were premenopausal with SDB. Complaints of chronic insomnia and sleepwalking were the most common reasons for referral, had been present for a mean of 6.4 +/- 5.4 years, and had lead to unsuccessful symptomatic treatment. The normal-weight premenopausal SDB group had anatomically small upper airways, while those with body mass index (BMI) >/= 25 kg/m(2) complained more frequently of snoring and daytime sleepiness and their clinical presentation was closer to those of the postmenopausal SDB comparison group. Premenopausal women often had a low apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), but there was a discrepancy between the low AHI and the amount of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) needed to control the SDB, and there was a need for higher pressures in overweight premenopausal SDB women (mean 9.1 +/- 1.9 and 10.1 +/- 2.6 cmH(2)O).	Normal-weight premenopausal SDB women often present with atypical sleep complaints of chronic insomnia and parasomnias.

We examined predictors of obesity in children with ASD with body mass index data for the proband, 1 sibling, and 2 parents using data from the multisite Simons Simplex Collection.	In a stepwise logistic regression model, proband obesity status was associated with obesity status of the sibling (odds ratio [OR] 2.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.92-3.70), mother (OR 2.10; 95% CI, 1.59-2.77), and father (OR 1.51; 95% CI, 1.15-1.98).

183,21112701,Drug and alcohol dependence,Psychopathic heroin addicts are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity.,"Impulsivity is a hallmark characteristic of drug addiction and a prominent feature of externalizing disorders such as psychopathy that are commonly comorbid with drug addiction. In a previous study (Vassileva et al., 2007) we have shown that psychopathic heroin addicts evidence more impulsive decision-making on the Iowa Gambling Task relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts. The goal of the current study was to investigate whether the observed impulse-control deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts would generalize to other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity, such as delay discounting and behavioral inhibition among a group of relatively 'pure' heroin addicts in Bulgaria who participated in our previous study.	We tested 92 currently abstinent male heroin addicts, classified as psychopathic or non-psychopathic based on the Hare Psychopathy Checklist - Revised (PCL-R). We administered two neurocognitive tasks of impulsivity: (1) Delayed Rewards Discounting Task, a measure of temporal discounting of rewards; and (2) Passive Avoidance Learning Task, a measure of behavioral inhibition.	Psychopathic heroin addicts were not impaired relative to non-psychopathic heroin addicts on the Delayed Rewards Discounting Task and the Passive Avoidance Learning Task, on the latter of which they showed better attentional capacity.	These results indicate that psychopathic heroin users are not uniformly impaired across neurocognitive domains of impulsivity. Combined with our previous findings, results suggest that the presence of psychopathy may exacerbate decision-making deficits in psychopathic heroin addicts, but it may not have significant effect on other neurocognitive domains of impulsivity in this population.",Remaining,0,0
184,17469116,Annals of neurology,Pathological TDP-43 distinguishes sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with SOD1 mutations.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a common, fatal motor neuron disorder with no effective treatment. Approximately 10% of cases are familial ALS (FALS), and the most common genetic abnormality is superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) mutations. Most ALS research in the past decade has focused on the neurotoxicity of mutant SOD1, and this knowledge has directed therapeutic strategies. We recently identified TDP-43 as the major pathological protein in sporadic ALS. In this study, we investigated TDP-43 in a larger series of ALS cases (n = 111), including familial cases with and without SOD1 mutations.	Ubiquitin and TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was performed on postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS (n = 59), ALS with SOD1 mutations (n = 15), SOD-1-negative FALS (n = 11), and ALS with dementia (n = 26). Biochemical analysis was performed on representative cases from each group.	All cases of sporadic ALS, ALS with dementia, and SOD1-negative FALS had neuronal and glial inclusions that were immunoreactive for both ubiquitin and TDP-43. Cases with SOD1 mutations had ubiquitin-positive neuronal inclusions; however, no cases were immunoreactive for TDP-43. Biochemical analysis of postmortem tissue from sporadic ALS and SOD1-negative FALS demonstrated pathological forms of TDP-43 that were absent in cases with SOD1 mutations.	These findings implicate pathological TDP-43 in the pathogenesis of sporadic ALS. In contrast, the absence of pathological TDP-43 in cases with SOD1 mutations implies that motor neuron degeneration in these cases may result from a different mechanism, and that cases with SOD1 mutations may not be the familial counterpart of sporadic ALS.",Remaining,0,0

We sought to determine if CT use for pediatric head trauma has decreased among US emergency departments (EDs).	This was a cross-sectional analysis of the National Hospital Ambulatory Care Medical Survey database of nationally representative ED visits from 2007 to 2015. We included children <18 years of age evaluated in the ED for head injury. Survey weighting procedures were used to estimate the annual proportion of children who underwent CT neuroimaging and to perform multivariable logistic regression.	There were an estimated 14.3 million pediatric head trauma visits during the 9-year study period. Overall, 32% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 29%-35%) of children underwent CT neuroimaging with no significant annual linear trend (P trend = .50). Multivariate analysis similarly revealed no difference by year (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.02; 95% CI: 0.97-1.07) after adjustment for patient- and ED-level covariates. CT use was associated with age ≥2 years (aOR: 1.51; 95% CI: 1.13-2.01), white race (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.10-1.86), highest triage acuity (aOR: 8.24 [95% CI: 4.00-16.95]; P < .001), and presentation to a nonteaching (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.05-2.06) or nonpediatric (aOR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.05-2.23) hospital.

The study included 44 boys with early-onset conduct disorder and 36 healthy controls (8 to 13 years old) together with their biological fathers. Resting heart rate and nonspecific skin conductance fluctuations were assessed as arousal measurements, with electrodermal responses and heart rate changes to pictorial stimuli serving as response measurements. In addition, boys and fathers were subjected to psychometric measurements of antisocial behavior.	The fathers of boys with CD showed significantly lower electrodermal responses to pictures of either emotional quality than the fathers of controls (p between.015 and < .001), and they revealed fewer nonspecific skin conductance fluctuations (p = .001). In addition, they reported a more aggressive, hostile, and impulsive behavioral style. Psychophysiological measurements were highly correlated between fathers and sons (p between .007 and < .001), and fathers' autonomic responses accounted for group differences in electrodermal responses between boys (p < .001).	The fathers of boys with conduct disorder exhibited an abnormal psychophysiological response pattern similar to that of their sons. High father-son correlations in psychophysiological measures raise the question of whether autonomic abnormalities may constitute a biological mediator through which the disposition for antisocial behavior is transmitted within families.",Remaining,0,0

Fifty-eight CD and 83 AC patients operated on over 10 years were carefully evaluated. The patients received a disease-related questionnaire and were invited for a follow-up at the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurosurgery. Thirty-three CD and 52 AC patients returned the questionnaire; 25 CD and 37 AC patients participated personally. CD patients underwent a dexamethasone suppression test, and IGF-1 levels were assessed in AC patients. Data on postoperative therapy were assessed.	84.8% of those with CD and 75.0% of those with AC had been followed by endocrinologists; 9.1% of CD and 1.9% of AC patients had been under no aftercare; 96% of CD patients were in remission. A recurrence occurred in four patients, two were newly detected by our study. IGF-1 was postoperatively normalized in 25 of 37 AC patients (67.6%). Twenty patients remained in remission, five relapsed. One patient received medical therapy upon recurrence and presented normal IGF-1; four patients with relapse had not been treated yet. Ten of 12 patients with elevated early postoperative IGF-1 received medical therapy that was commenced within 6 months in nine cases. The mean duration of medical therapy was 36 months (range 2-92). IGF-1 was still elevated at the last follow-up in eight of these ten patients, all of them receiving monotherapy. In four patients, the dose had been increased once.	The postoperative transfer back to the endocrinologist after operative treatment is achieved well in both groups. In uncured AC, medical therapy is initiated early, but options of therapy offer room for improvement. Therapy of recurrence is delayed in both pathologies.",Remaining,0,0
188,25365615,Archives of Iranian medicine,The same haplotype for two unrelated Wilson disease patients with new ATP7B mutation.,"Wilson disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism caused by mutation in the ATP7B gene. The combination of markers (such as SNPs) on a single chromosome can be used to understand the structure of haplotype in the human genome, in which provide notable information on the origin of the mutation in human genetic disorders. The purpose of this study was to determine a haplotype analysis of two unrelated Wilson disease patients with the same missense mutation, c.2335T>G (g.58164 T>G) in exon 8.	DNA was prepared from two patients with the c.2335T>G mutation, their first-degree relatives, and 50 selected homozygous individuals from consanguineous marriage for eight SNPs around this particular ATP7B mutation. PCR was performed for SNPs of exons 4 (g.47964 C>T), 5 (g.51482G>A), 6 (g.54622A>G), 7 (g.56255G>A), 9 (g.59042G>T), 11 (g.66363G>A), 13 (g.70004 G>C), and 14 (g.72244 A>G), which are located in upstream and downstream of this mutation. Then, restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) for these eight SNPs was designed and performed using eight different restriction enzymes.	Eight different haplotypes were found in the present study and the patients with the same missense mutation had the same haplotype. The most prevalent haplotype in 100 normal studied ATP7B alleles was the same as reference haplotype (C G A G T G G G A) for ATP7B gene (NG_008806.1).	As these two geographically separated families with the same mutation had the same haplotype, we concluded that this mutation possibly had the same origin in this population.",Remaining,0,0

Children's affect dysregulation at 24 and 36 months was defined in the context of mother-child interactions in semistructured play and toy cleanup. Dyads were classified as dysregulated at each age based on high negative affect. Affect dysregulation was associated with less maternal sensitivity and stimulation, more maternal depressive symptoms, and lower family income over the first 36 months of life. Children with early negative mood, lower Bayley Mental Development Index scores and insecure-avoidant (15 months) or insecure-resistant attachment classifications (36 months) were more likely to be in an affect-dysregulated group. Controlling for family and child variables, affect-dysregulated children had more problematic cognitive, social, and behavioral outcomes at 54 months, kindergarten, and first grade. The findings are discussed in terms of the early role played by parents in assisting children with affect regulation, the reciprocal nature of parent-child interactions, and the contribution of affect regulation to children's later cognitive, social, and behavioral competence.",Remaining,0,0

By increasing the number of nurses who are trained to deliver high-quality care to transgender patients, health inequities associated with provider discrimination can be mitigated. At present, baccalaureate nursing curricula do not adequately prepare nurses to care for transgender people, which is a shortcoming that has been attributed to limited teaching time and lack of guidance regarding new topics.	We developed transgender health content for students in a baccalaureate nursing program and used a student-faculty partnership model to integrate new content into the curriculum.	We incorporated new transgender health content into five required courses over three semesters.	We mitigated common barriers to developing and integrating new, diversity-related topics into a baccalaureate nursing curriculum. Added transgender health content was well received by students and faculty. [J Nurs Educ. 2016;55(8):476-479.].",Remaining,0,0
192,34915734,Crisis,Passive Suicidal Ideation in Childhood.,"Background: A growing body of empirical research shows that suicidal behaviors are prevalent in childhood. Yet, few studies have examined risk factors related to suicidal ideation (SI) among children aged 12 and younger. Aims: The current study addresses this gap. Method: A questionnaire was filled out by 1,350 Flemish primary caregivers (94.7% mothers) of 9-year-old children (50.4% boys, Mage = 9.45). Their responses were analyzed using logistic regression and independent samples t tests. Results: The presence of passive SI was reported in 10.5% of the children. A psychiatric, developmental, or behavioral condition (or multiple conditions), a learning disorder, impulsivity, aggression, and experiencing multiple stressful family life events were discovered as potential risk factors of passive SI in childhood. Limitations: The cross-sectional nature of this study meant that causality could not be inferred. In addition, it was based on reports of primary caregivers, rather than on reports from the children themselves. Conclusion: These new empirical findings can be used for the development of prevention programs and be taken into account in risk assessments of SI in clinical practice. Confirmation of our findings in a longitudinal child-reported study is needed.",Remaining,0,0

Impact on growth up to two years of age.,"A study was undertaken to investigate growth in children with different types of early feeding problems without any obvious medical explanation. Altogether 42 children were studied and followed up to the age of two years. Twenty-five children refused to eat (RTE), nine had colic, seven had vomiting and one child displayed hyperirritability at mealtimes. Comparisons were made with controls matched for sex, age and residential area. Attained weight and length were measured frequently; rates of gain were calculated and the growth variables were transformed to standard deviation scores (SD scores). After the onset of the symptoms the SD scores of attained weight and length decreased significantly in the children with RTE and in those with vomiting (p less than 0.05), and the rate of weight gain was significantly lower in the RTE group than in the control group (p less than 0.001). At two years of age the children with vomiting had recovered and showed a complete catch-up growth, while the RTE group had attained significantly lower SD scores of attained weight (p less than 0.001) and length (p less than 0.001) than the control group. It was found that the risk of growth impairment was greatest in children who refused all food or all food except breast milk.",Remaining,0,0

The aim of this research was to investigate the prevalence and determinants of dyspareunia and sexual dysfunction before and after childbirth.	Between November 2013 and April 2014, 109 women in their third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in a prospective cohort study at Ghent University Hospital. Dyspareunia, sexual functioning and quality of life (QOL) were evaluated at enrolment and again 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning and QOL were assessed using validated self-report questionnaires: the Female Sexual Function Index and the Short Form-36 health survey. Dyspareunia was evaluated by a specific self-developed questionnaire.	One hundred and nine women were enrolled; respectively, 71 (65.1%), 66 (60.6%) and 64 (58.7%) women returned the questionnaires prepartum, and 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Sexual functioning at 6 weeks was predictive of sexual functioning at 6 months postpartum (rs = 0.345, p = .015).

The case material embodied those psychiatric problems known to be common in medical populations, namely depression, delirium, dementia, and 'psychogenic' pain. The standardized simulations were punctuated by standardized 'open' questions with followup probes. A panel of experienced clinicians developed rating criteria for each question such that responses could be categorized ad 'good,' 'adequate,' 'inadequate,' or 'poor,' in terms of 'what an internist needs to know.' Blind raters of the exam achieved an interrater reliability of 0.08. The results indicate major deficits in the knowledge needed for assessment and treatment of these common problems. Only 16% of answers were 'good,' where as 42% were 'inadequate' or 'poor'. For example, 88% of the doctors could not name three factors that help distinguish organic from 'functional' psychosis, and 88% could not list three side-effects of tricyclic antidepressants.

However, robust evidence for most of these risk factors is lacking. Effective interventions should target risk factors in the causal pathway to dementia.	To comprehensively disentangle potentially causal aspects of modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) to inspire new drug targeting and improved prevention.	This genetic association study was conducted using 2-sample univariable and multivariable mendelian randomization. Independent genetic variants associated with modifiable risk factors were selected as instrumental variables from genomic consortia. Outcome data for AD were obtained from the European Alzheimer & Dementia Biobank (EADB), generated on August 31, 2021. Main analyses were conducted using the EADB clinically diagnosed end point data. All analyses were performed between April 12 and October 27, 2022.	Genetically determined modifiable risk factors.	Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs for AD were calculated per 1-unit change of genetically determined risk factors.	The EADB-diagnosed cohort included 39 106 participants with clinically diagnosed AD and 401 577 control participants without AD. The mean age ranged from 72 to 83 years for participants with AD and 51 to 80 years for control participants. Among participants with AD, 54% to 75% were female, and among control participants, 48% to 60% were female. Genetically determined high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations were associated with increased odds of AD (OR per 1-SD increase, 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.16]). Genetically determined high systolic blood pressure was associated with increased risk of AD after adjusting for diastolic blood pressure (OR per 10-mm Hg increase, 1.22 [95% CI, 1.02-1.46]). In a second analysis to minimize bias due to sample overlap, the entire UK Biobank was excluded from the EADB consortium; odds for AD were similar for HDL cholesterol (OR per 1-SD unit increase, 1.08 [95% CI, 1.02-1.15]) and systolic blood pressure after adjusting for diastolic blood pressure (OR per 10-mm Hg increase, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.01-1.50]).

202,3418380,Journal of neurosurgery,CSF leukotriene C4 following subarachnoid hemorrhage.,"Leukotrienes derive from arachidonic acid metabolism via the lipoxygenase pathway and modulate several cellular events. In the central nervous system, leukotrienes are mainly synthesized in the gray matter and in vascular tissues. Their production is enhanced in ischemic conditions and in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Previous studies have indicated the ability of the leukotrienes C4 and D4 to constrict arterial vessels in vivo and in vitro and have suggested their involvement in the pathogenesis of cerebral arterial spasm. In the present study, the authors measured lumbar and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of leukotriene C4 in 48 patients who had suffered aneurysmal SAH. In 12 of the cases, symptomatic and radiological spasm was evident. The mean lumbar CSF level of immunoreactive-like activity of leukotriene C4 (i-LTC4) was significantly higher (p less than 0.005) than in control cases, while the cisternal CSF level was higher than the lumbar mean concentration (p less than 0.005). Patients presenting with vasospasm had significantly higher levels of i-LTC4 compared to patients without symptomatic vasospasm. This is the first report concerning monitoring of i-LTC4 levels in the CSF after SAH. The results of this study suggest that: 1) metabolism of arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway is enhanced after SAH; 2) the higher cisternal CSF levels of i-LTC4 may be part of the biological response in the perianeurysmal subarachnoid cisterns after the hemorrhage; and 3) the higher CSF levels of i-LTC4 in patients presenting with vasospasm suggest that a relationship exists between this compound and arterial spasm and/or reflect the development of cerebral ischemic damage.",Remaining,0,0

However, it is not known if individuals with PD display this same endogenous-exogenous asymmetry when needing to terminate, disengage, and reprogram movements.	This study used a novel reaction time (RT) paradigm to test whether patients with mild PD have subclinical deficits of endogenous movement initiation and endogenous movement reprogramming.	Twelve non-demented individuals with PD on medication and 15 demographically similar healthy control (HC)participants completed an experimental paradigm that examined their RTs (key press) following self-selected valid action preparation (endogenous cues) versus valid exogenously presented cues. The paradigm also assessed participants' ability to rapidly stop their endogenous or exogenous preparation following an invalid cue and execute an alternative action (key press).	Participants with PD produced similar RTs as controls following endogenous and exogenous valid cues, and following invalid exogenous cues. However, following invalid endogenous cues, PD participants were slower than HC participants to stop an endogenous preparation and execute an alternative action.	Despite having mild disease and being on dopaminergic medication, these individuals with PD displayed deficits in motor disengagement and reprograming of self-selected actions.

A multicenter prospective study was conducted on otherwise healthy newborns born at ≥35 weeks of gestation and hospitalized for only NNJ in 50 collaborator neonatal intensive care units across Turkey over a 1-year period. Patients were analyzed for their demographic and clinical characteristics, treatment options, and complications.	Of the 5,620 patients enrolled, 361 (6.4%) had a bilirubin level ≥25 mg/dL on admission and 13 (0.23%) developed acute bilirubin encephalopathy. The leading cause of hospital admission was hemolytic jaundice, followed by dehydration related to a lack of proper feeding. Although all infants received phototherapy, 302 infants (5.4%) received intravenous immunoglobulin in addition to phototherapy and 132 (2.3%) required exchange transfusion.

However, little is known about white matter degeneration after stroke. It is unclear whether white matter degeneration occurs throughout the whole brain, or whether patterns of degeneration occur more in specific brain areas.	We prospectively collected National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in patients with acute ischemic stroke within the first week after onset (baseline), and at 1 and 3 months. DTI was processed to produce maps of fractional anisotropy, apparent diffusion coefficients, and axial and radial diffusivity. DTI parameters in specified regions-of-interest corresponding to items on the NIHSS were calculated and changes over time were assessed using linear mixed-effect modeling.	Seventeen patients were included in the study. Mean age (SD) was 71 (11.7) years, and median (IQR) baseline NIHSS 9 (5-13.3). Changes over time were observed in both visual cortices, contralesional primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, and superior temporal gyrus (P < .05). Changes in the ipsilesional motor cortex and inferior parietal lobule were only seen in patients with scores on the respective NIHSS-items (P < .05). No significant changes in global white matter diffusivity parameters were identified (P > .05).	White matter changes after stroke may be localized rather than a global phenomenon.",Remaining,0,0

212,37294375,Research on child and adolescent psychopathology,"Adolescents and Social Media: Longitudinal Links Between Types of Use, Problematic Use and Internalizing Symptoms.","Studies examining the associations between adolescent social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms show inconsistent results and do not elucidate the direction of associations. Differences in how studies operationalize social media use and consider potential moderating effects of sex and extraversion could contribute to inconsistencies. A distinction has been made between three types of social media use: passive, active and problematic. This study examined longitudinal associations between these types of adolescents' social media use and depression/anxiety symptoms and moderation effects of sex or extraversion. At ages 13 (T1) and 14 (T2), 257 adolescents completed an online questionnaire regarding their depression and anxiety symptoms and problematic social media use as well as three social media use diaries. Cross-lagged panel modeling (CLPM) revealed a positive association between problematic use and later anxiety symptoms (β = .16, p = .010). Extraversion moderated the association between active use and anxiety (β = -.14, p = .032). Specifically, active use predicted higher subsequent anxiety symptoms only in adolescents with low to moderate levels of extraversion. No sex moderation was found. While social media use (active or problematic) predicted later anxiety symptoms (but not depression), the reverse was not the case. However, highly extraverted individuals seem to be less vulnerable to potential negative effects of social media use.",Remaining,0,0
213,27981399,AIDS and behavior,The Usefulness of the CRAFFT in Screening for Problematic Drug and Alcohol Use Among Youth Living with HIV.,"Substance use is highly prevalent among youth living with HIV (YLWH) and negatively impacts HIV care. This study sought to determine whether the CRAFFT (Car, Relax, Alone, Forget, Friends, and Trouble), designed to screen for problematic substance use, is reliably associated with substance use behaviors among YLWH. A cross-sectional sample of 2216 youth (ages 12-26) were recruited through the adolescent medicine trials network for HIV/AIDS Interventions. Participants completed a self-administered survey. Over half screened positive on the CRAFFT (i.e., ≥2). Among frequent substance users, those older in age, behaviorally infected, with history of incarceration or unstably housed were more likely to screen positive on the CRAFFT. Study findings suggest that the CRAFFT reliably identifies youth who use substances. Thus, screening measures such as the CRAFFT should be utilized routinely in HIV clinical settings for youth.	El uso de sustancias entre jóvenes que viven con el VIH es muy prevalente y afecta negativamente el cuidado del VIH. Este estudio trató de determinar si el CRAFFT, una prueba diseñada para detectar el uso problemático de sustancias, se asocia con fiabilidad con comportamientos de consumo de sustancias entre los jóvenes que viven con el VIH. Una muestra transversal de 2216 jóvenes (edades 12-26) fueron reclutados a través del Adolescent Medicine Trials Network para Intervenciones contra el VIH/SIDA. Los participantes completaron una encuesta autoadministrada. Más de la mitad fueron seleccionados como positivos por el CRAFFT (es decir, ≥ 2). Entre los usuarios frecuentes de sustancias, los mayores de edad, los infectados por conducta en comparación con aquellos infectados perinatalmente, y aquellos con antecedentes de encarcelamiento y viviendas inestables fueron más propensos a resultados positivos en el CRAFFT. Los hallazgos del estudio sugieren que el CRAFFT identifica de manera fiable a los jóvenes que usan sustancias.

We implemented a two-locus linkage analysis model where a gene 1 genotype increases the risk of a broad phenotype and a gene 2 genotype modifies the expression of gene 1 by conferring susceptibility to a specific phenotype.	Compared to a single-locus analysis within the broad phenotype, the proposed approach had greater power to detect the modifier gene 2 (0.96 vs. 0.54 under a simulation scenario including heterogeneity). In a sample of 12 mixed SZ and BP Eastern Quebec kindreds, D8S1110 at 8p22 showed the strongest evidence of linkage to a gene determining a specific phenotype (SZ or BP) among subjects susceptible to major psychosis because of putative genes at 10p13 (D10S245, conditional maximized LOD (cMOD) = 4.20, p = 0.0003) and 3q21-q23 (D3S2418, cMOD = 4.09, p = 0.0005).

We determined the rates of brain atrophy using serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PDD and compared this finding to rates seen in cognitively intact Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and age-matched control subjects. Thirty-one patients (PD = 18, PDD = 13) and 24 age-matched controls underwent serial volumetric 1.5 T MRI scans, approximately 1 year apart. Baseline and repeat scans were registered and quantification of the brain boundary shift integral was used to determine whole-brain atrophy rates. Rates of brain atrophy were significantly increased in PDD (1.12 +/- 0.98%/year) compared to PD (0.31 +/- 0.69%/year; P = 0.018) and control subjects (0.34 +/- 0.76%/year; P = 0.015). There were no differences in atrophy rates between controls and PD (P = 0.79). No correlations between increased atrophy rates and age or dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination score) were observed.

Clinical, imaging (five CT and 20 MR examinations), and MRS (six studies in five patients) findings in 19 patients with mitochondrial disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Results were critically analyzed and, when applicable, compared with results in the literature.	Patients included four with mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), two with myoclonus, epilepsy, and ragged red fibers (MERRF), two with Kearns-Sayre syndrome, seven with Leigh syndrome, one with progressive cerebral poliodystrophy (Alpers syndrome), and three with trichopoliodystrophy (Menkes disease). MELAS, MERRF, and Kearns-Sayre tended to occur in older children and adults, whereas Leigh syndrome, Alpers syndrome, and Menkes disease occurred in infants and young children. All diseases involved gray matter early in their course, manifest primarily as T2 prolongation, with the deep cerebral nuclei being involved more often than the cerebral cortex. When T2 prolongation was seen in the white matter (MELAS, MERRF, Kearns-Sayre, Leigh), the peripheral and retrotrigonal white matter showed early involvement. Patients with Menkes disease showed rapidly progressive atrophy accompanied by large subdural hematomas. Proton MRS showed an elevated lactate level in involved regions of the brain; the lactate peak disappeared in old areas of T2 prolongation.	Mitochondrial disorders have a wide range of both clinical and imaging findings. Although no one set of findings is diagnostic of these disorders, the combination of deep gray matter involvement and peripheral white matter involvement in young adults or children should suggest the diagnosis, especially when associated with an elevated lactate level on proton MRS.",Remaining,0,0

Their ictal perfusion patterns were analyzed in relation to temporal and frontal hyperperfusion during TLE seizures using SPECT subtraction.	Thirty-three TLE patients had interictal and ictal SPECT, video-electroencephalographic (EEG) monitoring, and volumetric MRI. SPECT subtraction with MRI coregistration was performed using commercial software. The presence of ictal hyperperfusion was determined in the ipsilateral and contralateral temporal lobe, frontal lobe, cerebellum, and basal ganglia.	All patients showed ictal hyperperfusion in the temporal lobe of seizure origin. Vermian cerebellar hyperperfusion (CH) was observed in 26 patients (78.8%) and hemispheric CH was found in 25 (75.8%). Compared with the side of the epileptogenic temporal lobe, there were 7 patients with ipsilateral hemispheric CH (28.0%), 15 with contralateral hemispheric CH (60.0%), and 3 with bilateral hemispheric CH (12.0%). CH was observed more frequently in patients with additional frontal hyperperfusion (14/15, 93.3%; 2 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 10 contralateral, and 2 bilateral) than in patients without frontal hyperperfusion (11/18, 61.1%). Among 18 patients with temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion, 11 patients showed hemispheric CH (5 ipsilateral to seizure focus, 5 contralateral, 1 bilateral). Hyperperfusion in the basal ganglia (BGH) was seen in 11 of the 15 patients with temporal and frontal hyperperfusion (73.3%) and in 11 of the 18 with only temporal hyperperfusion (61.1%). In 17 patients with unilateral BGH (13 ipsilateral to the seizure focus, 4 contralateral), CH contralateral to the BGH was observed in 14 (82.5%), CH ipsilateral to the BGH was found in 2 (11.8%), and CH bilateral to the BGH was found in 1 (5.9%).	During TLE seizures, hemispheric CH occurred not only in contralateral but also in ipsilateral or bilateral cerebellar hemispheres to the side of seizure origin. Although temporal lobe origin seizures associated with additional frontal hyperperfusion produced more frequent hemispheric CH, seizures showing only temporal hyperperfusion without frontal hyperperfusion could produce BGH and CH. To determine the side of hemispheric CH, the most important factor appears to be the side of BGH, not the side of seizure origin.",Remaining,0,0

Subjects were 68 45- to 85-year-old, highly stressed care-givers to spouses with Alzheimer's disease. Results indicate that of the four operationalizations, Satisfaction with Support was the only significant predictor of depression and general psychopathology. The set of four support variables showed the strongest relationship to depression level, next strongest to general psychopathology, and least to physical health. The satisfaction with nine social support dimensions related differentially to the types of adjustment.

221,35124278,Journal of proteomics,"Isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine tags for absolute quantification of clusterin and apolipoprotein E in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and one of the leading causes of death in the United States. In the past decades, extensive efforts have been devoted to biomarker discovery for early diagnosis and treatment of AD. Herein, this study aims to quantify clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) in blood samples from AD patients and evaluate these two proteins as potential biomarkers in AD diagnosis. In-house synthesized 5-plex isotopic N,N-dimethyl leucine (iDiLeu) tags were used to label target peptide standards at different concentrations to construct standard curves. Our study revealed that the levels of CLU and APOE exhibited clear differences in male vs. female AD groups but not in male vs. female non-AD groups. In contrast, the levels of serum CLU and APOE did not show statistically significant differences in the AD groups and non-AD groups. Principal component analysis (PCA) with CLU and APOE showed some separation between the AD and non-AD participants. Significance: Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for sex-related pathways, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: As blood-based biomarkers for AD diagnosis are cost-effective and introduce less invasiveness, discovery and validation of biomarkers in the blood samples of AD patients have become a hot topic in Alzheimer's and dementia research. Thus far, amyloid β (Aβ), total-tau and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in blood show great accuracy and specificity in diagnosis of AD. However, the underlying mechanism of AD pathology remains to be elusive and complex. Besides these well studied proteins, many other proteins, such as clusterin (CLU) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) have also been found to be related to AD development. It has been implicated that these two proteins are involved in Aβ clearance and deposition. In this study, we measure the absolute concentrations of these two proteins in blood and shed some light on the potential roles of CLU and APOE in AD pathology. Dissecting CLU and APOE heterogeneity in AD pathogenesis may therefore facilitate delineating the pathological relevance for specific pathways between different genders, leading to personalized medicine in the future. Collectively, this study introduces a cost-effective absolute quantitative proteomics strategy for target protein quantitation and lays the foundation for future investigation of CLU and APOE as potential biomarkers for AD.",Remaining,0,0

Medical records of 86 consecutive participants who underwent brain biopsy under the guidance of a 1.0-T open MRI scanner with real-time and MR fluoroscopy techniques were evaluated retrospectively. All procedures were performed under local anaesthesia and intravenous conscious sedation. Diagnostic yield, diagnostic accuracy, complication rate and procedure duration were assessed. The lesions were divided into two groups according to maximum diameters: ≤ 1.5 cm (n = 16) and > 1.5 cm (n = 70). The two groups were compared using Fisher's exact test.	Diagnostic yield and diagnostic accuracy were 95.3% and 94.2%, respectively. The diagnostic yield of lesions ≤ 1.5 cm and > 1.5 cm were 93.8% and 95.7%, respectively. There was no significant difference in diagnostic yield between the two groups (p > 0.05). Mean procedure duration was 41 ± 5 min (range 33-49 min). All biopsy needles were placed with one pass.

No significant differences in psychosocial problems were observed between cases and controls in the total sample. Fewer case daughters reported eating problems compared with control daughters, and more case sons reported eating problems compared with control sons. More case daughters than case sons reported somatic stress symptoms and low self-esteem and displayed more caseness of anxiety/depression. These three sex differences were also observed among controls, indicating that they were general sex differences.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies have demonstrated neurochemical alterations in the frontal lobe of alcohol users, although most studies focused on older, alcohol-dependent subjects.	In this study, neurochemical data were acquired using MRS at 4.0 Tesla from emerging adults (18 to 24 years old) who were binge alcohol drinkers (BD, n = 23) or light drinkers (LD, n = 31). Since binge drinking is also associated with increased prevalence of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, BD were stratified into alcohol-induced blackout (BDBO) and non-blackout (BDN) groups.	Overall, BD had significantly lower gamma amino-butyric acid (GABA) and N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) than LD. When stratified by blackout history, BDBO also had lower ACC glutamate (Glu) than LD. No group differences in MRS metabolites were observed in the parietal-occipital cortex. Lower ACC GABA and Glu remained significant after accounting for lower gray matter content in BD, however, NAA differences were no longer evident. In addition, low ACC GABA levels were associated with greater alcohol use consequences, and worse response inhibition and attention/mental flexibility in BD.	These data indicate that binge drinking affects frontal lobe neurochemistry, more so in those who had experienced an alcohol-induced blackout. Characterization of the neurochemical profiles associated with binge alcohol consumption and blackout history may help identify unique risk factors for the later manifestation of alcohol abuse and dependence, in young individuals who are heavy, frequent drinkers, but who do not meet the criteria for alcohol abuse disorders.",Remaining,0,0

A questionnaire was designed consisting of questions about the current practice and estimated need for ECT in this population. This questionnaire was sent electronically (and by post if needed) to the forensic psychiatric hospitals in Germany.	We received replies from 52 hospitals (66%) and 29 of these hospitals stated that they were capable of treating patients with ECT. An indication for ECT treatment was seen in 3.4% of all detained patients across all forensic hospitals. In 1 year (2018) 32 ECT treatment courses were carried out with on average good effectiveness and a mean clinical global impressions (CGI) scale of 2.32. The most frequent reason for not using ECT was lack of structural requirements. Approximately one third of the forensic psychiatric hospitals stated that there was a medium or even high need for ECT in forensic psychiatry.	The use of ECT in German forensic psychiatry is currently very limited. It is striking that the number of applied ECT treatments is eight times lower in comparison to the frequency of indications. Nevertheless, approximately two thirds of the forensic hospitals stated a medium or high need for ECT, which seems to suggest a shortage of ECT in the treatment of forensic psychiatry patients.

To study the relationship between traditional cardiovascular risk factors and intima-media thickness.	Ultrasonic evaluation of the intima-media thickness of the common carotid artery was included in the 5-year follow-up examination of participants of the Edinburgh Artery Study. We had valid readings of intima-media thickness for 1106 men and women aged 60-80 years. Information on a range of cardiovascular risk factors had been collected during the baseline examination.	For men, in addition to age, lifetime smoking (measured in terms of pack years) was the only cardiovascular risk factor associated with increased intima-media thickness (P< or = 0.01) in the univariate analysis. Both systolic blood pressure (P < or = 0.001) and the high-density lipoprotein (HDL: total cholesterol ratio (P < or = 0.01) were correlated with intima-media thickness for women. When all the variables had been included in a multivariate analysis, pack years of smoking and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with early atherosclerotic development in men. In an equivalent analysis for women, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure and the HDL:total cholesterol ratio were associated with intima-media thickness.	These data suggest that risk factors affecting intima-media thickness differ for men and women.

Conventionally, the assessment process relies heavily on clinical experience and lacks quantitative analysis. In order to objectively quantify the upper-limb motor impairments in patients with post-stroke hemiparesis, this study proposes a novel assessment approach based on motor synergy quantification and multi-modality fusion. Fifteen post-stroke hemiparetic patients and fifteen age-matched healthy persons participated in this study. During different goal-directed tasks, kinematic data and surface electromyography(sEMG) signals were synchronously collected from these participants, and then motor features extracted from each modal data could be fed into the respective local classifiers. In addition, kinematic synergies and muscle synergies were quantified by principal component analysis (PCA) and k weighted angular similarity (k WAS) algorithm to provide in-depth analysis of the coactivated features responsible for observable movement impairments. By integrating the outputs of local classifiers and the quantification results of motor synergies, ensemble classifiers can be created to generate quantitative assessment for different modalities separately. In order to further exploit the complementarity between the evaluation results at kinematic and muscular levels, a multi-modal fusion scheme was developed to comprehensively analyze the upper-limb motor function and generate a probability-based function score. Under the proposed assessment framework, three types of machine learning methods were employed to search the optimal performance of each classifier. Experimental results demonstrated that the classification accuracy was respectively improved by 4.86% and 2.78% when the analysis of kinematic and muscle synergies was embedded in the assessment system, and could be further enhanced to 96.06% by fusing the characteristics derived from different modalities. Furthermore, the assessment result of multi-modality fusion framework exhibited a significant correlation with the score of standard clinical tests (R = - 0.87, P = 1.98e - 5). These promising results show the feasibility of applying the proposed method to clinical assessments for post-stroke hemiparetic patients.",Remaining,0,0
233,15370733,Journal of rehabilitation medicine,How to interpret normal electromyographic findings in patients with an alleged history of polio.,"In some patients with a history of polio, the electromyography is normal, not showing the typical neurogenic signs. The aim of this study was to explain the normal findings in electromyography, especially in paralytic polio.	Retrospective study.	Concentric needle electromyography, macro electromyography (including single fibre electromyography) and neurography were performed in various combinations in 688 patients with an alleged history of polio.	Thirty-five patients with paralytic polio had normal or minimally abnormal neurophysiology. In 6 patients the diagnosis of polio was rejected and was instead found to be other diagnoses. Three patients had a very atypical history. Of the 26 with possible paralytic polio, 17 showed a strong suspicion of previous paralytic polio without any neurophysiological signs of degeneration of the anterior horn cells.	If neurophysiological findings are normal in patients with a history of polio, the original diagnosis may be incorrect. However, the absence of electromyography changes does not entirely exclude a previous history of polio with transient functional loss without degeneration of anterior horn cells vulnerable for later functional impairment.",Remaining,0,0
234,18580596,Alzheimer disease and associated disorders,Assessing impulsivity changes in Alzheimer disease.,"Impulsive behaviors are common in brain-damaged patients including those with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease (AD). The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale assessing changes on 4 different dimensions of impulsivity, namely urgency, (lack of) premeditation, (lack of) perseverance, and sensation seeking, arising in the course of a neurodegenerative disease. To this end, caregivers of 83 probable AD patients completed a short questionnaire adapted from the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of the data were performed and revealed that a model with 4 distinct but related latent variables corresponding to 4 different dimensions of impulsivity fit the data best. Furthermore, the results showed that lack of perseverance, followed by lack of premeditation and urgency, increased after the onset of the disease, whereas sensation seeking decreased. Overall, the multifaceted nature of impulsivity was confirmed in a sample of AD patients, whose caregivers reported significant changes regarding each facet of impulsivity. Consequently, the short version of the UPPS Impulsive Behavior Scale opens up interesting prospects for a better comprehension of behavioral symptoms of dementia.",Remaining,0,0

In-depth interviews with staff working at 11 dedicated community-based personality disorder services in England together with a cross-sectional staff survey using the Maslach Burnout Inventory.	Levels of burnout were generally lower than those reported in previous studies among mental health workers and levels of personal accomplishment were higher. Staff reported positive as well as negative experiences of working with people with PD. Strong team-work, clear leadership and opportunities for reflective practice were thought to protect staff from burnout.	The low levels of burnout we found may reflect the early stage of the development of these services. However, it is also possible that working with people with PD does not in itself lead to burnout, especially when services are organized to share and contain work-related anxiety.",Remaining,0,0

However, its application has been partially impeded by the lack of comprehensive knowledge about the mechanical properties of various tissues within the plaque. Twenty-one human carotid plaques were collected from endarterectomy. The plaque was cut into rings, and different type of atherosclerotic tissues, including media, fibrous cap (FC), lipid and intraplaque haemorrhage/thrombus (IPH/T) was dissected for uniaxial extension testing. In total, 65 media strips from 17 samples, 59 FC strips from 14 samples, 38 lipid strips from 11 samples, and 21 IPH/T strips from 11 samples were tested successfully. A modified Mooney-Rivlin strain energy density function was used to characterize the stretch-stress relationship. The stiffnesses of media and FC are comparable, as are lipid and IPH/T. However, both media and FC are stiffer than either lipid or IPH/T. The median values of incremental Young's modulus of media, FC, lipid and IPH/T at λ=1 are 290.1, 244.5, 104.4, 52.9, respectively; they increase to 1019.5, 817.4, 220.7 and 176.9 at λ=1.1; and 4302.7, 3335.0, 533.4 and 268.8 at λ=1.15 (unit, kPa; λ, stretch ratio). The material constants of each tissue type are suggested to be: media, c1=0.138kPa, D1=3.833kPa and D2=18.803; FC, c1=0.186kPa, D1=5.769kPa and D2=18.219; lipid, c1=0.046kPa, D1=4.885kPa and D2=5.426; and IPH/T, c1=0.212kPa, D1=4.260kPa and D2=5.312.

Prospective study.	This study was hospital-based and included 62 inpatients with stroke.	The primary outcome was swallowing ability at discharge. The swallowing ability was assessed using the Food Intake Level Scale (FILS). The FILS change was calculated by subtracting FILS at admission from FILS at discharge. Ultrasound images were acquired at admission using B-mode ultrasound imaging. Muscle mass and intramuscular adipose tissue of the quadriceps were assessed based on muscle thickness and echo intensity, respectively. The mean muscle thickness and echo intensity of the right and left quadriceps were used in the analysis. A multiple regression analysis was performed to identify the factors independently associated with the FILS at discharge and FILS change. The independent variables were the muscle thickness and echo intensity of the quadriceps, FILS at admission, age, sex, body mass index, days from stroke onset, C-reactive protein, updated Charlson comorbidity index, number of medications, unit number of rehabilitation therapy, and Barthel Index score at admission.	Muscle thickness of the quadriceps was significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.27) and FILS change (β = 0.40). Echo intensity of the quadriceps was not significantly and independently associated with FILS at discharge (β = 0.22) and FILS change (β = 0.31).	Our results indicated that greater quadriceps muscle mass at post-acute care admission was associated with better swallowing ability at discharge in patients with stroke. Assessing muscle mass of the quadriceps at admission is important for predicting recovery of swallowing ability and interventions for quadriceps muscle mass may be effective for improving swallowing ability of patients with stroke.",Remaining,0,0

Findings based on children's self-reports were compared to findings based on mothers' reports about the children. Children's data support a depression-specific transmission. In contrast, mothers' data show an increased risk for all psychiatric syndromes covered in the study (including depression, anxiety, oppositionalism, inattention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, and antisocial acts). Results from multivariate analysis support the hypothesis that the discrepancy between mothers and children is in part a function of the tendency of depressed mothers to view their children as more symptomatic. The use of probands as informants may lead to an overestimation of familial aggregation, if the affected probands suffer from major depression or depressive symptoms.",Remaining,0,0
239,2708041,Headache,Cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction in muscle contraction headache and migraine.,"There have been some recent reports proposing that muscle contraction headache (MCH) and migraine are similar and may have a common etiology. It has been hypothesized that derangement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of migraine. However, reports on the ANS function in MCH have rarely been submitted. Therefore, in this report, MCH patients were investigated as well as migraine patients. The cardiovascular reflex responses by orthostatic test, isometric work test and the pulse rate (R-R interval) variation in fifteen MCH patients and fifteen migraine patients were recorded during headache-free intervals. The plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels were also measured throughout the orthostatic tests. Fifteen healthy subjects served as the age-matched control group. In the MCH group and the migraine group, blood pressure immediately after going from the supine to the erect position decreased more significantly than in the control group. The basal NE level was significantly low in both the MCH group and the migraine group, in comparison with the control group. MCH patients as well as migraine patients showed cardiovascular sympathetic hypofunction.",Remaining,0,0

Complaints of snoring are examined, and its prevalence, risk factors and screening reliability are discussed. The subjects who participated in the study were 6445 new outpatients from a general hospital. They were asked to answer a sleep questionnaire that consisted of 34 items with seven demographic items; each item was composed of four grades of frequency. In order to offset possible seasonal variations in sleep habits, data were collected across four seasons. Sleep patterns, insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnia and circadian rhythm sleep disorders were covered. Habitual snoring was seen in 16.0% of males and 6.5% of females. Male predominance was noted. From these data, the relationship between habitual snoring and sleep complaints was statistically analyzed. Habitual snorers (HS) were observed to wake up more frequently during sleep (17.8% of males, 21.5% of females) than were non-habitual snorers (NHS; 6.6% of males, 9.7% of females). Mid-sleep awakening of HS was also more frequent than it was for NHS; however, there were no differences in difficulty in falling asleep and early morning awakening.

The formula is based on 4 descriptive factors which characterize the lesion severity and potential outcome on the subject. The factors are, type of lesion, intensity of lesion, location and time of lesion duration before therapy is applied (TILT). A relative value is assigned to each TILT factor and the sum of these values determines the severity of the injury or traumindex. The relative benefit of specific therapy can then be assessed quickly and objectively by applying its effect on TILT. Three examples picked at random from the literature, illustrate application of TILT comparing 'claimed' and 'apparent' benefit of specific treatments. The formula is useful for both model-induced basic and sustained clinical injuries of the brain.",Remaining,0,0

The WPV1 isolate from this resident was genetically most closely related to WPV1 isolated in Angola in 2010. Subsequent investigation, including active case finding, revealed increased acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) hospital admissions beginning in September. Weekly admissions rose from approximately 10 AFP patients in early October to approximately 80 by the end of October and November. With response immunization activities, weekly AFP admissions fell to fewer than five by the end of December. A provisional total of 554 AFP cases were identified nationally, with paralysis onset from September 20, 2010, to February 27, 2011; 374 (68%) of the AFP cases were among males. Overall, 465 (84%) AFP cases were among residents of the neighboring departments of Kouilou and Pointe Noire, where the outbreak apparently began and where approximately 21% of ROC's 4.2 million persons reside. The case-fatality rate (CFR) in Kouilou and Pointe Noire was 40% (187 deaths of 465 cases), compared with 11% (10 of 89) elsewhere in ROC.

With strictly defined MRI diagnostic criteria, the electroencephalographic (EEG) focus was correctly lateralized in 86% of patients. Excluding patients with structural lesions, the criteria provided for correct lateralization of the epileptogenic focus in 78% and false lateralization in 5%. Hippocampal atrophy on T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity from mesial structures on T2-weighted scans were highly reliable for lateralization. Postoperative outcome did not differ between the patients with normal and those with abnormal findings on MRI, but the group sample was inadequate to assess the issue of surgical outcome. These findings suggest that with appropriate techniques and strictly defined diagnostic criteria, MRI can provide reliable seizure lateralization in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy.",Remaining,0,0

246,29052307,Developmental science,Instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress.,"Children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation. Early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms. To explore this possibility, we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning and/or cognitive flexibility as adolescents. Fifty-three 14-17-year-old adolescents (31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress, 22 control) completed an fMRI task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings. Adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes, but did so more slowly than their peers. Furthermore, these stress-exposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility; they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed. These learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning- and attention-related brain circuitry. Both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced. Taken together, the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress. These general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals.",Remaining,0,0

(1982) revealed a high degree (23%) of grade retention in a group of children with significant short stature secondary to growth hormone deficiency (GHD), constitutional delay (CD); or Turner's Syndrome (TS). Parents indicated in a free response format that 'immaturity' and 'small size' were the reasons for retention. The present follow-up study obtained academic achievement data on 47 of the 56 short children from the Holmes et al. (1982) study to assess what role academic factors, not spontaneously mentioned by parents, may have had in the retention decision. Results indicated that despite repeating a year in the primary grades, the group of retained children were still functioning 6 months below grade expectation, compared to grade appropriate achievement in the never-retained group. Parents and teachers were both accurate in their perceptions of children's academic achievement. Behavioural ratings by teachers indicated more adjustment difficulties for retained children, while parent ratings of behaviour showed a similar high level of problems for short children regardless of retention status. Although both groups of children possessed average intellectual abilities, the retained children obtained lower IQ scores than the never retained children. In summary, a majority of short children were achieving appropriate grade levels, but a substantial minority were experiencing under-achievement, behaviour problems, and grade retention, despite average intelligence.",Remaining,0,0
248,30108144,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,Oligodendrocyte precursor survival and differentiation requires chromatin remodeling by Chd7 and Chd8.,"Oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) constitute the main proliferative cells in the adult brain, and deregulation of OPC proliferation-differentiation balance results in either glioma formation or defective adaptive (re)myelination. OPC differentiation requires significant genetic reprogramming, implicating chromatin remodeling. Mounting evidence indicates that chromatin remodelers play important roles during normal development and their mutations are associated with neurodevelopmental defects, with CHD7 haploinsuficiency being the cause of CHARGE syndrome and CHD8 being one of the strongest autism spectrum disorder (ASD) high-risk-associated genes. Herein, we report on uncharacterized functions of the chromatin remodelers Chd7 and Chd8 in OPCs. Their OPC-chromatin binding profile, combined with transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analyses of Chd7-deleted OPCs, demonstrates that Chd7 protects nonproliferative OPCs from apoptosis by chromatin closing and transcriptional repression of p53 Furthermore, Chd7 controls OPC differentiation through chromatin opening and transcriptional activation of key regulators, including Sox10, Nkx2.2, and Gpr17 However, Chd7 is dispensable for oligodendrocyte stage progression, consistent with Chd8 compensatory function, as suggested by their common chromatin-binding profiles and genetic interaction. Finally, CHD7 and CHD8 bind in OPCs to a majority of ASD risk-associated genes, suggesting an implication of oligodendrocyte lineage cells in ASD neurological defects. Our results thus offer new avenues to understand and modulate the CHD7 and CHD8 functions in normal development and disease.",Remaining,0,0
249,22733427,Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and subtypes of Parkinson's disease.,"Numerous studies have explored the potential relationship between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and manifestations of PD. Our aim was to perform an expanded extensive assessment of motor and nonmotor manifestations in PD to identify whether RBD was associated with differences in the nature and severity of these manifestations. PD patients underwent polysomnography (PSG) to diagnose the presence of RBD. Participants then underwent an extensive evaluation by a movement disorders specialist blinded to PSG results. Measures of disease severity, quantitative motor indices, motor subtypes, therapy complications, and autonomic, psychiatric, visual, and olfactory dysfunction were assessed and compared using regression analysis, adjusting for disease duration, age, and sex. Of 98 included patients, 54 had RBD and 44 did not. PD patients with RBD were older (P = 0.034) and were more likely to be male (P < 0.001). On regression analysis, the most consistent links between RBD and PD were a higher systolic blood pressure (BP) change while standing (-23.9 ± 13.9 versus -3.5 ± 10.9; P < 0.001), a higher orthostatic symptom score (0.89 ± 0.82 versus 0.44 ± 0.66; P = 0.003), and a higher frequency of freezing (43% versus 14%; P = 0.011). A systolic BP drop >10 could identify PD patients with RBD with 81% sensitivity and 86% specificity. In addition, there was a probable relationship between RBD and nontremor predominant subtype of PD (P = 0.04), increased frequency of falls (P = 0.009), and depression (P = 0.009). Our results support previous findings that RBD is a multifaceted phenomenon in PD.

To address this issue, we performed a genome-wide association study among 6345 apparently healthy women in which we evaluated 336,108 SNPs as potential determinants of plasma CRP concentration. Overall, seven loci that associate with plasma CRP at levels achieving genome-wide statistical significance were found (range of p values for lead SNPs within the seven loci: 1.9 x 10(-)(8) to 6.2 x 10(-)(28)). Two of these loci (GCKR and HNF1A) are suspected or known to be associated with maturity-onset diabetes of the young, one is a gene-desert region on 12q23.2, and the remaining four loci are in or near the leptin receptor protein gene, the apolipoprotein E gene, the interleukin-6 receptor protein gene, or the CRP gene itself. The protein products of six of these seven loci are directly involved in metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, beta cell function, weight homeostasis, and/or premature atherothrombosis. Thus, common variation in several genes involved in metabolic and inflammatory regulation have significant effects on CRP levels, consistent with CRP's identification as a useful biomarker of risk for incident vascular disease and diabetes.",Remaining,0,0

The purpose of this study was to examine whether the pathway from ADI to AUD symptoms by early adulthood is moderated by ethnicity and possessing an alcohol-metabolizing gene ALDH2*2 variant allele.	We used multigroup structural equation modeling, including 5 groups split by ethnicity and ALDH2*2, to examine the consistency of the path from ADI to AUD symptoms in 604 Chinese-, Korean-, and White-American college students. We further examined the effects of ALDH2*2, ethnicity, and their interaction in Asians to better understand their unique contributions to the moderation.	The association between ADI and AUD symptoms was moderated, with ADI negatively associated with AUD symptoms among Koreans without ALDH2*2 and Whites, but not among Koreans with ALDH2*2 or Chinese regardless of ALDH2*2. Both ALDH2*2 and ethnicity within Asians contributed unique variability in the effect.	Ethnicity and ALDH2*2 altered the relationship of ADI as a risk factor for AUD symptoms. Being Chinese and possessing an ALDH2*2 allele within Koreans both buffered against the risk for AUD symptoms associated with earlier ADI, indicating that this relationship can be attenuated by protective factors.",Remaining,0,0

In this study, we investigated the pathophysiology of this HDL deficiency by examining both HDL samples from NPD-B patients and nascent high density lipoprotein (LpA-I) generated by incubation of lipid-free apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with NPD-B fibroblasts. Interestingly, both LpA-I and HDL isolated from patient plasma had a significant increase in sphingomyelin (SM) mass (approximately 50-100%). Analysis of LCAT kinetics parameters (V(max) and K(m)) revealed that either LpA-I or plasma HDL from NPD-B, as well as reconstituted HDL enriched with SM, exhibited severely decreased LCAT-mediated cholesterol esterification. Importantly, we documented that SM enrichment of NPD-B LpA-I was not attributable to increased cellular mass transfer of SM or unesterified cholesterol to lipid-free apoA-I. Finally, we obtained evidence that the conditioned medium from HUVEC, THP-1, and normal fibroblasts, but not NPD-B fibroblasts, contained active secretory sphingomyelinase (S-SMase) that mediated the hydrolysis of [(3)H]SM-labeled LpA-I and HDL(3). Furthermore, expression of mutant SMase (DeltaR608) in CHO cells revealed that DeltaR608 was synthesized normally but had defective secretion and activity. Our data suggest that defective S-SMase in NPD leads to SM enrichment of HDL that impairs LCAT-mediated nascent HDL maturation and contributes to HDL deficiency. Thus, S-SMase and LCAT may act in concert and play a crucial role in the biogenesis and maturation of nascent HDL particles.",Remaining,0,0

Overall, 87% of the replication attempts were statistically significant in the expected direction. The replication effects were typically 77% as strong as the corresponding original effects, which represents a significant decline in effect size. The replicability of individual effects was predicted by the effect size and design of the original study, as well as the sample size and statistical power of the replication.

However, recent research suggests that focusing on pain status (i.e., the presence or absence of chronic pain) at treatment initiation may not reflect the clinical significance of pain over the long-term course of OUD. Reports of variability in chronic pain and its clinical significance over time have yet to be investigated in patients with prescription OUD. The present study examined variability in chronic pain status from entry into prescription OUD treatment through 3.5-year follow-up. Additionally, we examined the association between concurrent chronic pain and opioid use at three follow-up time points.	This secondary analysis (N = 309) of a national, randomized, controlled trial of prescription OUD treatment used generalized estimating equations to assess variability in the prevalence of chronic pain from study entry to 3.5-year follow-up, and the association between chronic pain status and concurrent opioid use.	Fifty-three percent of participants reported variability in chronic pain status over time. The prevalence of chronic pain decreased from study entry through follow-up (aOR = 0.47, p < 0.001). Chronic pain was associated with increased opioid use at each follow-up assessment (aOR = 3.56, p < 0.001).	Chronic pain status may vary over time in those with prescription OUD, and chronic pain appears to be associated with concurrent opioid use. The present findings highlight the importance of assessing chronic pain throughout the course of prescription OUD.",Remaining,0,0
258,29554099,PLoS computational biology,The Pathway Coexpression Network: Revealing pathway relationships.,"A goal of genomics is to understand the relationships between biological processes. Pathways contribute to functional interplay within biological processes through complex but poorly understood interactions. However, limited functional references for global pathway relationships exist. Pathways from databases such as KEGG and Reactome provide discrete annotations of biological processes. Their relationships are currently either inferred from gene set enrichment within specific experiments, or by simple overlap, linking pathway annotations that have genes in common. Here, we provide a unifying interpretation of functional interaction between pathways by systematically quantifying coexpression between 1,330 canonical pathways from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) to establish the Pathway Coexpression Network (PCxN). We estimated the correlation between canonical pathways valid in a broad context using a curated collection of 3,207 microarrays from 72 normal human tissues. PCxN accounts for shared genes between annotations to estimate significant correlations between pathways with related functions rather than with similar annotations. We demonstrate that PCxN provides novel insight into mechanisms of complex diseases using an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) case study. PCxN retrieved pathways significantly correlated with an expert curated AD gene list. These pathways have known associations with AD and were significantly enriched for genes independently associated with AD. As a further step, we show how PCxN complements the results of gene set enrichment methods by revealing relationships between enriched pathways, and by identifying additional highly correlated pathways. PCxN revealed that correlated pathways from an AD expression profiling study include functional clusters involved in cell adhesion and oxidative stress. PCxN provides expanded connections to pathways from the extracellular matrix. PCxN provides a powerful new framework for interrogation of global pathway relationships. Comprehensive exploration of PCxN can be performed at http://pcxn.org/.",Remaining,0,0

This study also examined the effects of ADHD on the academic and social lives of college students. The sample consisted of 219 university students. These students were interviewed by a psychiatrist with regard to ADHD symptoms according to the DSM-IV. The Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS), the Teen Interpersonal Influence Scale, and a demographic information form were used as measurement devices. The ADHD and control groups were classified in three different ways: (1) met the ADHD criteria for both Clinical Diagnosis and the ASRS; (2) met only the criteria for Clinical Diagnosis; or (3) met only the criteria of the ASRS. Our research shows that individuals with ADHD experience more problems with money management and are more affected by the media, friends, and brands compared with individuals without ADHD. Smoking and alcohol use disorders, accidents, being held back, and disciplinary actions often accompany ADHD in college students. To the best of our knowledge, the shopping attitudes of young adults with ADHD and the influence of the media, peers, family, and brands have not been studied until now.",Remaining,0,0
260,35411967,Annals of neurology,Heterozygous PNPT1 Variants Cause Spinocerebellar Ataxia Type 25.,"Dominant spinocerebellar ataxias (SCA) are characterized by genetic heterogeneity. Some mapped and named loci remain without a causal gene identified. Here we applied next generation sequencing (NGS) to uncover the genetic etiology of the SCA25 locus.	Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing were performed in families linked to SCA25, including the French family in which the SCA25 locus was originally mapped. Whole exome sequence data were interrogated in a cohort of 796 ataxia patients of unknown etiology.	The SCA25 phenotype spans a slowly evolving sensory and cerebellar ataxia, in most cases attributed to ganglionopathy. A pathogenic variant causing exon skipping was identified in the gene encoding Polyribonucleotide Nucleotidyltransferase PNPase 1 (PNPT1) located in the SCA25 linkage interval. A second splice variant in PNPT1 was detected in a large Australian family with a dominant ataxia also mapping to SCA25. An additional nonsense variant was detected in an unrelated individual with ataxia. Both nonsense and splice heterozygous variants result in premature stop codons, all located in the S1-domain of PNPase. In addition, an elevated type I interferon response was observed in blood from all affected heterozygous carriers tested. PNPase notably prevents the abnormal accumulation of double-stranded mtRNAs in the mitochondria and leakage into the cytoplasm, associated with triggering a type I interferon response.	This study identifies PNPT1 as a new SCA gene, responsible for SCA25, and highlights biological links between alterations of mtRNA trafficking, interferonopathies and ataxia.

The study was undertaken with 93 children aged from 2 to 8 years to examine whether the items of the PAGS construct a unidimensional scale that can be used to measure children's play ability. The internal scale validity and the person response validity of the PAGS were investigated by examining the goodness-of-fit of the play items and children's play performance to the many-faceted Rasch model for the PAGS. In total, 46 of the 51 play items demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit. Of the 93 children, 90.3% demonstrated acceptable goodness-of-fit on the scale of play items. Overall, the results support both the scale and person response validity for the PAGS, as well as providing preliminary evidence that the PAGS can be used for a more detailed evaluation of children's abilities in play performance within natural day-care contexts. Further research is needed to examine other aspects of the validity and reliability of the PAGS measures.",Remaining,0,0
262,8483863,Preventive medicine,Predictors and reasons for relapse in smoking cessation with nicotine and placebo patches.,"The reasons for relapse to smoking are not fully understood but several factors are of importance. Addiction to nicotine seems to play a prominent role but there are several other contributing factors.	To determine predictors of outcome in smoking cessation, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in a large smoking cessation trial comprising 289 subjects. Weight gain and withdrawal symptoms were analyzed separately as predictors. To determine self-perceived reasons for relapse we created a questionnaire, which was answered by 132 relapsers.	Previous attempts to quit smoking and a low saliva cotinine concentration were significantly associated with abstinence in the nicotine-treated group. A trend toward higher abstinence rates was found among males and among subjects with a low nicotine dependency score. Logistic regression analysis showed higher success rates in subjects with the largest weight gain during the first weeks of quitting in contrast to higher relapse rates in subjects who had the greatest weight gain after 3 months. A high score on withdrawal symptoms was not predictive of relapse. Subjects with 'slips' had a markedly increased relapse rate. Craving for cigarettes was the most often self-reported (48%) reason for relapse.	The relation between weight gain, withdrawal scoring, and outcome seems rather complex. Craving for cigarettes was the most reported reason for relapse.",Remaining,0,0
263,30732635,Orphanet journal of rare diseases,Disease progression in women with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy is slow.,"Over 80% of women with X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) develop spinal cord disease in adulthood for which treatment is supportive only. For future clinical trials quantitative data on disease progression rates are essential. Moreover, diagnosis can be challenging in ALD women, as the most important diagnostic biomarker is normal in 15-20%. Better biomarkers are needed. The purpose of this single centre cross-sectional follow-up study in women with ALD was to assess whether Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), AMC Linear Disability Scale (ALDS) and Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36) can detect disease progression and to model the effect of age and duration of symptoms on the rate of progression. Moreover, we performed a pilot study to assess if a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers.	In this study 46 women (baseline clinical data published by our group previously) were invited for a follow-up visit. Newly identified women at our center were also recruited. We analysed 65 baseline and 34 follow-up assessments. Median time between baseline and follow-up was 7.8 years (range 6.4-8.7). Mean age at baseline was 49.2 ± 14.2 years, at follow-up 55.4 ± 10.1. EDSS increased significantly (+ 0.08 points/year), but the other outcome measures did not. Increasing age and duration of symptoms were associated with more disability. For the pilot study we analysed plasma of 20 ALD women and 10 controls with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry, which identified 100 potential biomarker ratios with strong differentiating properties and non-overlapping data distributions between ALD women and controls.	Progression of spinal cord disease can be detected with EDSS, but not with ALDS or SF-36 after a follow-up period of almost 8 years. Moreover, age and the duration of symptoms seem positively associated with the rate of progression. Although a significant progression was measurable, it was below the rate generally conceived as clinically relevant. Therefore, EDSS, ALDS and SF-36 are not suitable as primary outcome measures in clinical trials for spinal cord disease in ALD women. In addition, a semi-targeted lipidomics approach can identify possible new diagnostic biomarkers for women with ALD.",Remaining,0,0

This syndrome can be differentiated from depression and is recognizable in palliative care settings. It is associated with chronic medical illness, disability, bodily disfigurement, fear of loss of dignity, social isolation, and--where there is a subjective sense of incompetence--feelings of greater dependency on others or the perception of being a burden. Because of the sense of impotence or helplessness, those with the syndrome predictably progress to a desire to die or to commit suicide.

265,29725038,Scientific reports,(Poly)phenol-digested metabolites modulate alpha-synuclein toxicity by regulating proteostasis.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease associated with the misfolding and aggregation of alpha-synuclein (aSyn). The molecular underpinnings of PD are still obscure, but nutrition may play an important role in the prevention, onset, and disease progression. Dietary (poly)phenols revert and prevent age-related cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in model systems. However, only limited attempts were made to evaluate the impact of digestion on the bioactivities of (poly)phenols and determine their mechanisms of action. This constitutes a challenge for the development of (poly)phenol-based nutritional therapies. Here, we subjected (poly)phenols from Arbutus unedo to in vitro digestion and tested the products in cell models of PD based on the cytotoxicity of aSyn. The (poly)phenol-digested metabolites from A. unedo leaves (LPDMs) effectively counteracted aSyn and H2O2 toxicity in yeast and human cells, improving viability by reducing aSyn aggregation and inducing its clearance. In addition, LPDMs modulated pathways associated with aSyn toxicity, such as oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial impairment, and SIR2 expression. Overall, LPDMs reduced aSyn toxicity, enhanced the efficiency of ER-associated protein degradation by the proteasome and autophagy, and reduced oxidative stress. In total, our study opens novel avenues for the exploitation of (poly)phenols in nutrition and health.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In order to study the contribution of neuronal connections and neuron-glia interactions to this variation in neuronal vulnerability, we used hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to various periods of histotoxic ischemia. Organotypic cultures were exposed at 37 degrees C for 0, 7, 30 and 60 min to a glucose-free NaCN-containing medium. Histological analysis using thionin staining and MAP2 immunostaining showed differences in the temporal profile of neuronal damage in hippocampal and neocortical structures, i.e., in decreasing order, CA1 (7 min) > CA3 and neocortical layers II, III, V, VI (30 min) > DG and neocortical layer IV (60 min). In parallel to the neurodegeneration study, the time course and the regional pattern of microglial and astroglial changes were also examined using GS-B4 isolectin and GFAP as immunohistochemical markers, respectively. The GS-B4 isolectin staining revealed an early (at 7 min for the hippocampus) and a specific microglial activation located in areas undergoing neuronal damage. For both organotypic cultures, astrogliosis occurred later (after 30 min of stress) with no specific regional distribution. Both hippocampal and neocortical cultures submitted to histotoxic ischemia allowed the replication of many of the cellular events observed in response to global ischemia in vivo. These findings support the hypothesis that neuron-neuron connections as well as interactions between neurons and glial cells are essential to reproduce in vitro the selective neuronal vulnerability described in vivo.",In-vitro-study,8,0

268,27628239,Scientific reports,α-Synuclein is a Novel Microtubule Dynamase.,"α-Synuclein is a presynaptic protein associated to Parkinson's disease, which is unstructured when free in the cytoplasm and adopts α helical conformation when bound to vesicles. After decades of intense studies, α-Synuclein physiology is still difficult to clear up due to its interaction with multiple partners and its involvement in a pletora of neuronal functions. Here, we looked at the remarkably neglected interplay between α-Synuclein and microtubules, which potentially impacts on synaptic functionality. In order to identify the mechanisms underlying these actions, we investigated the interaction between purified α-Synuclein and tubulin. We demonstrated that α-Synuclein binds to microtubules and tubulin α2β2 tetramer; the latter interaction inducing the formation of helical segment(s) in the α-Synuclein polypeptide. This structural change seems to enable α-Synuclein to promote microtubule nucleation and to enhance microtubule growth rate and catastrophe frequency, both in vitro and in cell. We also showed that Parkinson's disease-linked α-Synuclein variants do not undergo tubulin-induced folding and cause tubulin aggregation rather than polymerization. Our data enable us to propose α-Synuclein as a novel, foldable, microtubule-dynamase, which influences microtubule organisation through its binding to tubulin and its regulating effects on microtubule nucleation and dynamics.",In-vitro-study,8,0
269,25637797,Neuroscience,Enhanced angiogenesis promoted by human umbilical mesenchymal stem cell transplantation in stroked mouse is Notch1 signaling associated.,"Cellular therapy has provided hope for restoring neurological function post stroke through promoting endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. The current study was based on the observation that transplantation of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) promoted the neurological function improvement in stroked mice and meanwhile enhanced angiogenesis in the stroked hemisphere. Grafted hUCMSCs secreted human vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). Notch1 signaling was activated after stroke and also in the grafted hUCMSCs. To address the potential mechanism that might mediate such pro-angiogenic effect, we established a hUCMSC-neuron co-culture system. Neurons were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) injury before co-culturing to mimic the in vivo cell transplantation. Consistent with the in vivo data, co-culture medium claimed from hUCMSC-OGD neuron co-culture system significantly promoted the capillary-like tube formation of brain-derived endothelial cells. Moreover, coincident with our in vivo data, Notch 1 signaling activation was detected in hUCMSCs after co-cultured with OGD neurons as demonstrated by the up-regulation of key Notch1 signaling components Notch1 and Notch1 intercellular domain (NICD). In addition, OGD-neuron co-culture also increased the VEGF-A production by hUCMSCs. To verify whether Notch1 activation was involved in the pro-angiogenic effect, γ-secretase inhibitor N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-L-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) was added into the co-culture medium before co-culture. It turned out that DAPT significantly prevented the Notch1 activation in hUCMSCs after co-culture with OGD neurons. More importantly, the pro-angiogenic effect of hUCMSCs was remarkably abolished by DAPT addition as demonstrated by inhibited capillary-like tube formation and less VEGF-A production. Regarding how Notch1 signaling was linked with VEGF-A secretion, we provided some clue that Notch1 effector Hes1 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated by OGD-neuron co-culturing and down-regulated after additional treatment of DAPT. In summary, our data provided evidence that the VEGF-A secretion from hUCMSCs after being triggered by OGD neurons is Notch1 signaling associated. This might be a possible mechanism that contributes to the angiogenic effect of hUCMSC transplantation in stroked brain.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In this study, midbrain organoids were yielded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to prepare cells for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. Neural stem/precursor cells (NSCs) isolated from midbrain organoids (Og-NSCs) expanded stably and differentiated into midbrain-type dopamine(mDA) neurons, and an unprecedentedly high proportion expressed midbrain-specific factors, with relatively low cell line and batch-to-batch variations. Single cell transcriptome analysis followed by in vitro assays indicated that the majority of cells in the Og-NSC cultures are ventral midbrain (VM)-patterned with low levels of cellular senescence/aging and mitochondrial stress, compared to those derived from 2D-culture environments. Notably, in contrast to current methods yielding mDA neurons without astrocyte differentiation, mDA neurons that differentiated from Og-NSCs were interspersed with astrocytes as in the physiologic brain environment. Thus, the Og-NSC-derived mDA neurons exhibited improved synaptic maturity, functionality, resistance to toxic insults, and faithful expressions of the midbrain-specific factors, in vitro and in vivo long after transplantation. Consequently, Og-NSC transplantation yielded potent therapeutic outcomes that are reproducible in PD model animals. Collectively, our observations demonstrate that the organoid-based method may satisfy the demands needed in the clinical setting of PD cell therapy.",In-vitro-study,8,0

We examined which secretory pathway trypsinogen takes to the surface of this endocrine-derived cell line. The 'constitutive' pathway externalizes proteins rapidly and in the absence of an external stimulus. In the alternate, 'regulated' pathway, proteins are stored in secretory granules until the cells are stimulated to secrete with 8-Br-cAMP. On the basis of indirect immunofluorescence localization, stimulation of release, and subcellular fractionation, we find that trypsinogen is targeted into the regulated secretory pathway in AtT-20 cells. In contrast, laminin, an endogenous secretory glycoprotein, is shown to be secreted constitutively. Thus it appears that the transport apparatus for the regulated secretory pathway in endocrine cells can recognize not only endocrine prohormones, but also the exocrine protein trypsinogen, which suggests that a similar sorting mechanism is used by endocrine and exocrine cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0

275,22363216,PLoS genetics,GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of Parkinson's disease-associated LRRK2 is regulated by ArfGAP1.,"Mutations in the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene are the most common cause of autosomal dominant familial Parkinson's disease (PD) and also contribute to idiopathic PD. LRRK2 encodes a large multi-domain protein with GTPase and kinase activity. Initial data indicates that an intact functional GTPase domain is critically required for LRRK2 kinase activity. PD-associated mutations in LRRK2, including the most common G2019S variant, have variable effects on enzymatic activity but commonly alter neuronal process morphology. The mechanisms underlying the intrinsic and extrinsic regulation of LRRK2 GTPase and kinase activity, and the pathogenic effects of familial mutations, are incompletely understood. Here, we identify a novel functional interaction between LRRK2 and ADP-ribosylation factor GTPase-activating protein 1 (ArfGAP1). LRRK2 and ArfGAP1 interact in vitro in mammalian cells and in vivo in brain, and co-localize in the cytoplasm and at Golgi membranes. PD-associated and functional mutations that alter the GTPase activity of LRRK2 modulate the interaction with ArfGAP1. The GTP hydrolysis activity of LRRK2 is markedly enhanced by ArfGAP1 supporting a role for ArfGAP1 as a GTPase-activating protein for LRRK2. Unexpectedly, ArfGAP1 promotes the kinase activity of LRRK2 suggesting a potential role for GTP hydrolysis in kinase activation. Furthermore, LRRK2 robustly and directly phosphorylates ArfGAP1 in vitro. Silencing of ArfGAP1 expression in primary cortical neurons rescues the neurite shortening phenotype induced by G2019S LRRK2 overexpression, whereas the co-expression of ArfGAP1 and LRRK2 synergistically promotes neurite shortening in a manner dependent upon LRRK2 GTPase activity. Neurite shortening induced by ArfGAP1 overexpression is also attenuated by silencing of LRRK2. Our data reveal a novel role for ArfGAP1 in regulating the GTPase activity and neuronal toxicity of LRRK2; reciprocally, LRRK2 phosphorylates ArfGAP1 and is required for ArfGAP1 neuronal toxicity. ArfGAP1 may represent a promising target for interfering with LRRK2-dependent neurodegeneration in familial and sporadic PD.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Studies in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms of cellular dysfunction associated with the expression of faulty PD genes.	We developed a yeast model for full-length LRRK2 studies. We expressed wild-type (wt) LRRK2 and mutations and evaluated their role during oxidative stress conditions. The involvement of mitochondria was assessed by using rho-zero mutants and by evaluating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane potential by flow cytometry. The involvement of endocytosis was also studied by testing several endocytic mutants and by following the vacuolar delivery of the probe FM4-64.	Expression of LRRK2 in yeast was associated to increased hydrogen peroxide resistance. This phenotype, which was dependent on mitochondrial function, was not observed for PD-mutants G2019S and R1441C or in the absence of the kinase activity and the WD40 repeat domain. Expression of the pathogenic mutants stimulated ROS production and increased mitochondrial membrane potential. For the PD-mutants, but not for wild-type LRRK2, endocytic defects were also observed. Additionally, several endocytic proteins were required for LRRK2-mediated protection against hydrogen peroxide.	Our results indicate that LRRK2 confers cellular protection during oxidative stress depending on mitochondrial function and endocytosis.	Both the loss of capacity of LRRK2 pathogenic mutants to protect against oxidative stress and their enhancement of dysfunction may be important for the development of PD during the aging process.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In recent years, many studies have focused on the mechanism(s) of PQ neurotoxicity. In this study, we examined the neuroprotective effect of manganese (III) meso-tetrakis (N,N'-diethylimidazolium) porphyrin (MnTDM), a superoxide dismutase/catalase mimetic, on PQ-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in 1RB3AN27 (N27) cells, a dopaminergic neuronal cell line. The results indicated that MnTDM significantly attenuated PQ-induced loss of cell viability, glutathione depletion, and reactive oxygen species production. MnTDM also ameliorated PQ-induced morphological nuclear changes of apoptosis and increased rates of apoptosis. In addition, our data provide direct evidence that MnTDM suppressed PQ-induced caspase-3 cleavage, possibly a key event of PQ neurotoxicity. These observations suggested that oxidative stress and apoptosis are implicated in PQ-induced neurotoxicity and this toxicity could be prevented by MnTDM.

Its protective effect has been investigated in oxidative stress related diseases such as cerebral ischemia in recent years. However, experimental evidence also shows that ebselen causes cell death in several different cell types.

Herein, we studied the effect of ebselen on C6 glioma cells under oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), an in vitro ischemic model. We found that ebselen significantly enhanced cell death after 3 h of OGD as observed by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH) release and cellular morphological changes. Further studies revealed that depletion of cellular glutathione level by the combined action of ebselen and OGD played a role in enhanced cell death as demonstrated by the following evidence: (1) cellular GSH was significantly depleted by the combined effort of ebselen and OGD, compared to that of ebselen or OGD insult alone; (2) exogenous addition of N-acetyl cysteine completely diminished the cell damage induced by ebselen and OGD; (3) supplement of glucose, which provides cellular reducing agents and thus maintains cellular GSH level, to the OGD medium diminished C6 cell damage induced by ebselen. We conclude that depleting cellular glutathione plays an important role in ebselen-induced cell death with OGD. Our results suggest that ebselen can have a beneficial or toxic effect, depending on the availability of GSH.",In-vitro-study,8,0
280,21978081,Rejuvenation research,Neuroinflammation in delirium: a postmortem case-control study.,"Delirium can be hypothesized to be an extreme manifestation of sickness behavior in elderly persons with neurodegenerative disease. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether increased cerebral inflammation with microglial, astrocyte, and cytokine activation exists in patients with delirium compared to nondelirious patients.	Postmortem brain tissue from 9 cases with delirium was compared to 6 age-matched controls without delirium. Human leukocyte antigen-DR (HLA-DR) and CD68 cell count and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6,β-amyloid, and tau protein immunoreactivity were determined in hippocampus, frontal cortex, and white matter.	There were no significant differences in the patients with delirium compared to the controls with respect to age 73 versus 70.5 years (p=0.72) or dementia (22% versus 0%, p=0.22). Both markers for microglial activity showed significantly higher scores in delirium brain specimens than controls in the total brain score (HLA-DR 129 vs. 20 and CD68 30 vs. 8.5) as well as in the various brain areas separately. The immunoreactivity of astrocyte activity (GFAP) was higher in the total brain score in patients with delirium (5.2 vs. 4.0, p=0.05), but in the various brain areas this was only significant in the dentate gyrus. IL-6 immunoreactivity was higher in patients with delirium in all brain areas and IL-1β was not detectable. Coexisting infectious disease or dementia did not influence the overall results.	These preliminary study results show an association between human brain activity of microglia, astrocytes, and IL-6 and delirium in elderly patients and add to the accumulating evidence that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in delirium.",In-vitro-study,8,0
281,19701582,Sheng li xue bao : [Acta physiologica Sinica],[Cerebral lymphatic blockage aggravates apoptosis of hippocampal neurons induced by cerebrospinal fluid from experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage].,"This work was performed to determine the role of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway in the development of neural injury following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH and cerebral lymphatic blockage (CLB) models in adult New Zealand rabbits were used. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was obtained from experimental animals 5 d after modeling and was added into cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The neurons were randomly divided into blank control, normal CSF, SAH, and SAH+CLB groups. At different points of time, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage was detected by colorimetric method. Flow cytometry was used to detect the apoptosis of neurons. Expressions of Bax and heat-shock protein 70 (Hsp70) were determined by immunohistochemical staining. LDH leakage detection revealed that, compared with blank control group, CSF from normal rabbit did not damage the neurons, whereas the leakage of LDH increased in SAH group and SAH+CLB group. The increasing effect was more obvious in SAH+CLB group than that in SAH group. Normal CSF did not induce the apoptosis of neurons, whereas neuron apoptosis was found in SAH group and the apoptosis was even more severe in SAH+CLB group. Bax and Hsp70 protein expressions were found in both SAH and SAH+CLB groups. Expression of Bax protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group in a time-dependent manner. At 0.5 h and 1 h, the expression of Hsp70 protein in SAH+CLB group was stronger than that in SAH group, whereas the expression became weaker at 2 h and 4 h. These results suggest that blockage of cerebral lymphatic drainage pathway deteriorates the damage of neurons treated with CSF from SAH, indicating this pathway may act as an endogenous protective role in SAH.",In-vitro-study,8,0
282,23768781,Biomaterials,The effect of cationic albumin-conjugated PEGylated tanshinone IIA nanoparticles on neuronal signal pathways and neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia.,"Targeted treatment of ischemic stroke remains problem due to the complex pathogenesis of this disease and the difficulty in drug delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In the present study, the delivery efficiency of cationic bovine serum albumin-conjugated tanshinone IIA PEGylated nanoparticles (CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs) in rat brain was investigated. We further explored whether the protective mechanism of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs in cerebral ischemia was associated with modulating neuronal signaling pathways. The experimental cerebral ischemia model was established to evaluate the treatment efficacy of CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs. The pharmacokinetics demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs could obviously prolong circulation time and increase plasma concentration compared with intravenously administrated TIIA solution. The biodistribution and brain uptake study confirmed that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs possessed better brain delivery efficacy with a high drug accumulation and fluorescence quantitative level in brain. CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs effectively reduced infarction volume, neurological dysfunctions, neutrophils infiltration and neuronal apoptosis. Moreover, CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs significantly suppressed the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and IL-8; upregulated the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and increase TGF-β1 level in the ischemic brain. In addition, treatment with CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs markedly inhibited the mRNA expressions of GFAP, MMP-9, COX-2, p38MAPK, ERK1/2 and JNK, downregulated the protein levels of GFAP, MMP-9 and COX-2, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, p38MAPK and JNK. These results demonstrated that CBSA-PEG-TIIA-NPs displayed remarkable neuroprotective effects on ischemic stroke through modulation of MAPK signal pathways involved in the cascades of neuroinflammation.",In-vitro-study,8,0
283,25413246,Cell transplantation,Human umbilical cord blood cells induce neuroprotective change in gene expression profile in neurons after ischemia through activation of Akt pathway.,"Human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) cell therapies have shown promising results in reducing brain infarct volume and most importantly in improving neurobehavioral function in rat permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion, a model of stroke. In this study, we examined the gene expression profile in neurons subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) with or without HUCB treatment and identified signaling pathways (Akt/MAPK) important in eliciting HUCB-mediated neuroprotective responses. Gene chip microarray analysis was performed using RNA samples extracted from the neuronal cell cultures from four experimental groups: normoxia, normoxia+HUCB, OGD, and OGD+HUCB. Both quantitative RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out to verify the microarray results. Using the Genomatix software program, promoter regions of selected genes were compared to reveal common transcription factor-binding sites and, subsequently, signal transduction pathways. Under OGD condition, HUCB cells significantly reduced neuronal loss from 68% to 44% [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 16)=11, p=0.0003]. Microarray analysis identified mRNA expression of Prdx5, Vcam1, CCL20, Alcam, and Pax6 as being significantly altered by HUCB cell treatment. Inhibition of the Akt pathway significantly abolished the neuroprotective effect of HUCB cells [one-way ANOVA, F(3, 11)=8.663, p=0.0031]. Our observations show that HUCB neuroprotection is dependent on the activation of the Akt signaling pathway that increases transcription of the Prdx5 gene. We concluded that HUCB cell therapy would be a promising treatment for stroke and other forms of brain injury by modifying acute gene expression to promote neural cell protection.",In-vitro-study,8,0
284,rayyan-1270414108,Cytotherapy,Fifty-Hertz electromagnetic fields facilitate the induction of rat bone mesenchymal stromal cells to differentiate into functional neurons,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Research results have shown that bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) can different into neural cells. Electromagnetic fields (EMF) play a role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, but the mechanisms behind this are unknown. In the present study, we explored the efficacy of EMF on the induction of rat BMSC differentiation into neurons in vitro. METHODS: First, rat BMSC were induced in a nerve cell culture environment and divided into three groups: an EMF induction treatment group (frequency of 50 Hz, magnetic induction of 5 mT, 60 min per day for 12 days), an induction-only group and a control group. Second, we observed cell phenotypes in a confocal microscope, tested gene expression through the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and detected postsynaptic currents by means of a cell patch-clamp. We analyzed the cell cycles and the portion of cells expressing neural cell markers with the use of flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results indicated that EMF can facilitate BMSC differentiation into neural cells, which expressed neuronal-specific markers and genes; they formed synaptic junctions and pulsed excitatory postsynaptic currents. At the same time, the G0-G1 phase ratio recorded by means of flow cytometry gradually decreased under the EMF treatment, whereas there was an increase of S-phase ratio, and the portion of cells expressing neuronal-specific markers increased. CONCLUSIONS: Given that a noninvasive treatment of 50-Hz EMF could significantly facilitate BMSC to differentiate into functional neurons, EMF appears to be a promising clinical option for stem cell transplantation therapies to combat central nervous system diseases.",In-vitro-study,8,0
285,8558175,Journal of neuropathology and experimental neurology,Transfection of an invasive human astrocytoma cell line with a TIMP-1 cDNA: modulation of astrocytoma invasive potential.,"Malignant astrocytomas are highly invasive tumors which infiltrate diffusely into regions of normal brain. The degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) by matrix metalloproteinases is thought to be one of the most important steps in the process of tumor invasion. However, the activity of most matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) can be modulated by simultaneously secreted inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, TIMPs). We have previously shown that an imbalance between the levels of MMPs and TIMPs may be essential in the determination of the invasiveness of certain human malignant astrocytoma cell lines. To determine if the up-regulation of TIMP genes and gene products could modulate the invasiveness of human malignant astrocytoma cells, in the present study we have transfected a highly invasive astrocytoma cell line, SF-188, with an expression vector carrying a full-length TIMP-1 cDNA. The parental SF-188 astrocytoma cell line overexpresses the 72-kDa and 92-kDa type IV collagenases with little expression of TIMPs-1 and -2. Following transfection with TIMP-1, SF-188 astrocytoma clones expressed the 0.9 kb TIMP-1 message by northern analysis, and produced a 21 kDa metalloproteinase inhibitor by reverse zymography. The stable TIMP-1 SF-188 transformants demonstrated morphological changes and diminished growth rates in soft agar when compared to controls. The invasion of successfully TIMP-1 transfected astrocytoma cells across matrigel-coated filters was significantly decreased over controls. These results suggest that upregulation of TIMP-1 expression in SF-188 astrocytoma cells has decreased their in vitro invasive potential.",In-vitro-study,8,0
286,33211254,Cardiovascular drugs and therapy,Effectiveness and Safety of Direct Oral Anticoagulants in an Asian Population with Atrial Fibrillation Undergoing Dialysis: A Population-Based Cohort Study and Meta-Analysis.,"Whether direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are more effective and safer than warfarin among Asian patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) undergoing dialysis remains unclear.	We first compared the risks of ischemic stroke/systemic embolism (IS/SE) and major bleeding associated with DOACs compared with warfarin, in NVAF Asians undergoing dialysis using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) (Aim 1). Next, we searched PubMed and Medline from January 1, 2010 until January 31, 2020, to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational real-world studies comparing DOACs with warfarin specifically focused on NVAF patients with stage 4 or 5 chronic kidney disease undergoing dialysis (Aim 2). Finally, we tested the hypothesis whether AF patients undergoing dialysis treated with OACs (warfarin and DOACs) would be associated with lower risk of adverse clinical outcomes as compared to those without OACs using the Taiwan NHIRD (Aim 3).	From June 1, 2012, to December 31, 2017, a total of 3237 and 9263 NVAF patients comorbid with ESRD receiving oral anticoagulant (OACs) (490 on DOAC, 2747 on warfarin) or no OACs, respectively, were enrolled. Propensity score matching was used to balance covariates across the study groups. For the comparison of DOAC vs. warfarin (Aim 1), DOACs had comparable risks of IS/SE and major bleeding to warfarin in our present cohort. From the original 85 results retrieved, nine studies (including our study) with a total of 6490 and 22,494 patients treated with DOACs and warfarin were included in the meta-analysis, respectively. There were 5343 (82%) and 20,337 (90%) patients treated with DOACs and warfarin undergoing dialysis, respectively. The pooled meta-analysis also indicated no difference of the effectiveness (HR:0.90; [95%CI:0.74-1.10]; P = 0.32) and safety outcomes (HR:0.75; [95%CI:0.54-1.05]; P = 0.09) between DOACs and warfarin (Aim 2). For the comparison of OAC (+) vs. OAC (-) (Aim 3), OAC-treatment was associated with a higher risk of IS/SE (hazard ratio (HR):1.54; [95% confidential interval (CI):1.29-1.84];P < 0.0001) and comparable risk of major bleeding compared to those without OAC treatment.	DOACs did not provide benefit over warfarin regarding effectiveness and safety in AF patients undergoing dialysis. The use of OAC was not associated with a lower risk of IS/SE in ESRD AF patients when compared to those without OAC use.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
287,16249421,Jama,Suicide prevention strategies: a systematic review,"CONTEXT: In 2002, an estimated 877,000 lives were lost worldwide through suicide. Some developed nations have implemented national suicide prevention plans. Although these plans generally propose multiple interventions, their effectiveness is rarely evaluated. OBJECTIVES: To examine evidence for the effectiveness of specific suicide-preventive interventions and to make recommendations for future prevention programs and research. DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Relevant publications were identified via electronic searches of MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and PsychINFO databases using multiple search terms related to suicide prevention. Studies, published between 1966 and June 2005, included those that evaluated preventative interventions in major domains; education and awareness for the general public and for professionals; screening tools for at-risk individuals; treatment of psychiatric disorders; restricting access to lethal means; and responsible media reporting of suicide. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted on primary outcomes of interest: suicidal behavior (completion, attempt, ideation), intermediary or secondary outcomes (treatment seeking, identification of at-risk individuals, antidepressant prescription/use rates, referrals), or both. Experts from 15 countries reviewed all studies. Included articles were those that reported on completed and attempted suicide and suicidal ideation; or, where applicable, intermediate outcomes, including help-seeking behavior, identification of at-risk individuals, entry into treatment, and antidepressant prescription rates. We included 3 major types of studies for which the research question was clearly defined: systematic reviews and meta-analyses (n = 10); quantitative studies, either randomized controlled trials (n = 18) or cohort studies (n = 24); and ecological, or population- based studies (n = 41). Heterogeneity of study populations and methodology did not permit formal meta-analysis; thus, a narrative synthesis is presented. DATA SYNTHESIS: Education of physicians and restricting access to lethal means were found to prevent suicide. Other methods including public education, screening programs, and media education need more testing. CONCLUSIONS: Physician education in depression recognition and treatment and restricting access to lethal methods reduce suicide rates. Other interventions need more evidence of efficacy. Ascertaining which components of suicide prevention programs are effective in reducing rates of suicide and suicide attempt is essential in order to optimize use of limited resources.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

RESULTS: Six published studies fulfilled our criteria for inclusion, with only three studies large enough to have the power to detect an association. There appears to be a small but significantly, increased risk of late pregnancy SSRI exposure associated with PPHN in one case-control study; OR 5.1 (95% CI, 1.9-13.3) and two large cohort studies; RR 2.56; (95% CI, 1.17-4.85) and OR 2.1 (95% CI, 1.5-3.0) The other three studies did not find an association. CONCLUSION: the absolute risk cannot be determined, but it is very small, probably less than 1%.

289,36897426,Archives of sexual behavior,Prevalence of Intoxicating Substance Use Before or During Sex Among Young Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Drug use before or during sex is a high-risk sexual behavior associated with adverse health risks and outcomes, such as increasing the likelihood of overdoses and of acquiring sexually-transmitted diseases. This systematic review and meta-analysis of three scientific databases examined the prevalence of the use of intoxicating substances, those tending to excite or stupefy the user on a psychoactive level, before or during sex, among young adults (18-29 years old). A total of 55 unique empirical studies met the inclusion criteria (48,145 individuals; 39% males), were assessed for risk of bias using the tools of Hoy et al. (2012), and were analyzed via a generalized linear mixed-effects model. The results produced a global mean prevalence of this sexual risk behavior of 36.98% (95% CI: 28.28%, 46.63%). Nonetheless, significant differences were identified between different intoxicating substances, with the use of alcohol (35.10%; 95% CI: 27.68%, 43.31%), marijuana (27.80%; 95% CI: 18.24%, 39.92%), and ecstasy (20.90%; 95% CI: 14.34%, 29.45%) significantly more prevalent than that of cocaine (4.32%; 95% CI: 3.64%, 5.11%), heroin (.67%; 95% CI: .09%, 4.65%), methamphetamine (7.10%; 95% CI: 4.57%, 10.88%), and GHB (6.55%; 95% CI: 4.21%, 10.05%). Moderator analyses showed that the prevalence of alcohol use before or during sex differed according to geographical sample origin, and increased as the proportion of ethnic whites in samples increased. The remaining demographic (e.g., gender, age, reference population), sexual (e.g., sexual orientation, sexual activity), health (e.g., drug consumption, STI/STD status), methodological (e.g., sampling technique), and measurement (e.g., timeframe) variables that were examined did not moderate prevalence estimates.

290,28753768,Eur Urol Focus,A Quality Assessment of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures for Sexual Function in Neurologic Patients Using the Consensus-based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments Checklist: A Systematic Review,"CONTEXT: Impaired sexual function has a significant effect on quality of life. Various patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are available to evaluate sexual function. The quality of the PROMs to be used for neurologic patients remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review which validated PROMs are available to evaluate sexual function in neurologic patients and to critically assess the quality of the validation studies and measurement properties for each identified PROM. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: A systematic review was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis statement. The included publications were assessed according to the Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments checklist. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Twenty-one studies for PROMs regarding sexual function were identified for the following patient groups: spinal cord injury (11 studies), multiple sclerosis (MS; 6 studies), Parkinson's disease (2 studies), traumatic brain injury (1 study), and epilepsy (1 study). The evidence for the quality of PROMs was found to be variable, and overall evaluation of measurement properties was lacking in 71% of the studies. The measurement error and responsiveness were not studied in any of the publications. CONCLUSIONS: Several PROMs have been identified to evaluate sexual function in neurologic patients. Strong evidence was found only for the Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-15 and Multiple Sclerosis Intimacy and Sexuality Questionnaire-19 for patients with MS, although evidence was lacking for certain measurement properties as well. Future research should focus on identifying relevant PROMs and establishing adequate quality for all measurement properties in studies with high methodological quality. PATIENT SUMMARY: A quality assessment of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) for sexual function in neurologic patients was made. The evidence found for good PROMs was limited. Studies with high methodological quality are needed to improve the quality of PROMs to evaluate sexual function in neurologic patients.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
291,35466396,Cochrane Database Syst Rev,Psychological treatments for depression and anxiety in dementia and mild cognitive impairment,"BACKGROUND: Experiencing anxiety and depression is very common in people living with dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). There is uncertainty about the best treatment approach. Drug treatments may be ineffective and associated with adverse effects. Guidelines recommend psychological treatments. In this updated systematic review, we investigated the effectiveness of different psychological treatment approaches. OBJECTIVES: Primary objective To assess the clinical effectiveness of psychological interventions in reducing depression and anxiety in people with dementia or MCI. Secondary objectives To determine whether psychological interventions improve individuals' quality of life, cognition, activities of daily living (ADL), and reduce behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia, and whether they improve caregiver quality of life or reduce caregiver burden. SEARCH METHODS: We searched ALOIS, the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's register, MEDLINE, Embase, four other databases, and three trials registers on 18 February 2021. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared a psychological intervention for depression or anxiety with treatment as usual (TAU) or another control intervention in people with dementia or MCI. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A minimum of two authors worked independently to select trials, extract data, and assess studies for risk of bias. We classified the included psychological interventions as cognitive behavioural therapies (cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), behavioural activation (BA), problem-solving therapy (PST)); 'third-wave' therapies (such as mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT)); supportive and counselling therapies; and interpersonal therapies. We compared each class of intervention with control. We expressed treatment effects as standardised mean differences or risk ratios. Where possible, we pooled data using a fixed-effects model. We used GRADE methods to assess the certainty of the evidence behind each result. MAIN RESULTS: We included 29 studies with 2599 participants. They were all published between 1997 and 2020. There were 15 trials of cognitive behavioural therapies (4 CBT, 8 BA, 3 PST), 11 trials of supportive and counselling therapies, three trials of MBCT, and one of interpersonal therapy. The comparison groups received either usual care, attention-control education, or enhanced usual care incorporating an active control condition that was not a specific psychological treatment. There were 24 trials of people with a diagnosis of dementia, and five trials of people with MCI. Most studies were conducted in community settings. We considered none of the studies to be at low risk of bias in all domains.  Cognitive behavioural therapies (CBT, BA, PST) Cognitive behavioural therapies are probably slightly better than treatment as usual or active control conditions for reducing depressive symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.23, 95% CI -0.37 to -0.10; 13 trials, 893 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). They may also increase rates of depression remission at the end of treatment (risk ratio (RR) 1.84, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.88; 2 studies, with one study contributing 2 independent comparisons, 146 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were very uncertain about the effect of cognitive behavioural therapies on anxiety at the end of treatment (SMD -0.03, 95% CI -0.36 to 0.30; 3 trials, 143 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Cognitive behavioural therapies probably improve patient quality of life (SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.50; 7 trials, 459 participants; moderate-certainty evidence) and activities of daily living at end of treatment compared to treatment as usual or active control (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; 7 trials, 680 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). Supportive and counselling interventions Meta-analysis showed that supportive and counselling interventions may have little or no effect on depressive symptoms in people with dementia compared to usual care at end of treatment (SMD -0.05, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.07; 9 trials, 994 participants; low-certainty evidence). We were very uncertain about the effects of these treatments on anxiety, which was assessed only in one small pilot study. Other interventions There were very few data and very low-certainty evidence on MBCT and interpersonal therapy, so we were unable to draw any conclusions about the effectiveness of these interventions. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CBT-based treatments added to usual care probably slightly reduce symptoms of depression for people with dementia and MCI and may increase rates of remission of depression. There may be important effect modifiers (degree of baseline depression, cognitive diagnosis, or content of the intervention). CBT-based treatments probably also have a small positive effect on quality of life and activities of daily living. Supportive and counselling interventions may not improve symptoms of depression in people with dementia. Effects of both types of treatment on anxiety symptoms are very uncertain. We are also uncertain about the effects of other types of psychological treatments, and about persistence of effects over time. To inform clinical guidelines, future studies should assess detailed components of these interventions and their implementation in different patient populations and in different settings.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
292,26000815,The International journal of neuroscience,Neural overexpression of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 and refractory epilepsy: a meta-analysis of nine studies.,"Overexpression of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ATP-binding cassette (ABC)) transporters may contribute to intractable epilepsy (IE) by reducing brain accumulation of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). We conducted a meta-analysis of studies on expression and cellular distribution of multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) in IE patients to evaluate the contribution of this protein to AED resistance. In addition, we summarize experiments examining MRP1 expression and substrates in animal models of IE.	The literature search based on pre-established inclusion and exclusion criteria, as well as quality assessment, data extraction and statistical analyses were conducted concurrently by two independent researchers. We identified nine high-quality studies (Jadad score ≥3) published between 2000 and 2014 on the expression and cellular distribution of MRP1 in IE patients. A fixed effect model was used to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). Forest and funnel plots were constructed to assess study heterogeneity and publication bias, respectively.	MRP1 expression was significantly higher in both astrocytes (OR = 17.04, 95% CI: 7.69-37.76, P < 0.00001) and neurons (OR = 22.13, 95% CI: 8.52-57.46, P < 0.00001) of IE patients compared to controls, while there was no significant difference in endothelial cell MRP1 expression (OR: 1.47, 95% CI: 0.09-1.79, P = 0.48). Funnel plot symmetry indicated no substantial publication bias. Most relevant preclinical studies from 2000 to 2014 found higher MRP1 expression in IE model rodents. Furthermore, MRP1 overexpression reduced the extracellular concentration of AEDs in brain, while MRP1 inhibitors enhanced brain AED concentrations.	Pooled results strongly suggest that MRP1 is overexpressed in both neurons and astrocytes of IE patients. Inhibition of MRP1 may enhance AED efficacy by increasing local drug availability.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

The objective of this study is to assess the relationship of IL-10 -1082G/A polymorphism and AD risk by using meta-analysis.	All eligible case-control studies were searched in Pubmed and Embase. Odds ratios (OR) with the 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to assess the association.	A total of 2158 cases and 2088 controls in 12 case-control studies were included. The results indicated that the A allele carriers (AA+AG) had a 27% increased risk of AD, when compared with the homozygote GG (OR=1.27, 95%CI=1.02-1.58 for AA+AG vs. GG). In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, significant elevated risks were associated with A allele carriers in Europeans (OR=1.27 and 95%CI=1.01-1.59 for AA+AG vs. GG), but not in Asians (OR=1.37 and 95%CI=0.32-5.88 for AA+AG vs. GG).	This meta-analysis suggested that the -1082G/A polymorphism of IL-10 gene would be a risk factor for AD. To further evaluate gene-to-gene and gene-to-environmental interactions between polymorphisms of IL-10 gene and AD risk, more studies with large groups of patients are required.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

The present review aims to describe the current status of intraoperative AR for the treatment of cerebrovascular pathology. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The following databases were searched: PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, and EMBASE up to December, 2020. The search strategy consisted of ""augmented reality,"" ""AR,"" ""cerebrovascular,"" ""navigation,"" ""neurovascular,"" ""neurosurgery,"" and ""endovascular"" in both AND and OR combinations. Studies included were original research articles with intraoperative application. The manuscripts were thoroughly examined for study design, outcomes, and results. Sixteen studies were identified describing the use of intraoperative AR in the treatment of cerebrovascular pathology. A total of 172 patients were treated for 190 cerebrovascular lesions using intraoperative AR. The most common treated pathology was intracranial aneurysms. Most studies were cases and there was only a case-control study. A head-up display system in the microscope was the most common AR display. AR was found to be useful for tailoring the craniotomy, dura opening, and proper identification of donor and recipient vessels in vascular bypass. Most AR systems were unable to account for tissue deformation. This systematic review suggests that intraoperative AR is becoming a promising and feasible adjunct in the treatment of cerebrovascular pathology. It has been found to be a useful tool in the preoperative planning and intraoperative guidance. However, its clinical benefits remain to be seen.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the similarities and differences between HD and HDL2 by establishing the clinical phenotype of HDL2 with the published cases. METHODS: A literature review of all clinically described cases of HDL2 until the end of 2016 was performed and a descriptive analysis was carried out. RESULTS: Sixty-nine new cases were described between 2001 and 2016. All cases had likely African ancestry, and most were found in South Africa and the USA. Many features were found to be similar to HD, including a strong negative correlation between repeat length and age of onset. Chorea was noted in 48/57 cases (84%). Dementia was reported in 74% patients, and Parkinsonism in 37%. Psychiatric features were reported in 44 out of 47 cases. Patients with chorea had lower expanded repeat lengths compared to patients without chorea. Eye movements were described in 19 cases, 8 were abnormal. Acanthocytes were detected in 4 of the 13 patients tested. Nineteen out of 20 MRIs were reported as abnormal with findings similar to HD. CONCLUSION: This review clarifies some aspects of the HDL2 phenotype and highlights others which require further investigation. Features that are unique to HDL2 have been documented in a minority of subjects and require prospective validation.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
296,32086598,Current neurology and neuroscience reports,State of the Evidence Traffic Lights 2019: Systematic Review of Interventions for Preventing and Treating Children with Cerebral Palsy.,"Cerebral palsy is the most common physical disability of childhood, but the rate is falling, and severity is lessening. We conducted a systematic overview of best available evidence (2012-2019), appraising evidence using GRADE and the Evidence Alert Traffic Light System and then aggregated the new findings with our previous 2013 findings. This article summarizes the best available evidence interventions for preventing and managing cerebral palsy in 2019.	Effective prevention strategies include antenatal corticosteroids, magnesium sulfate, caffeine, and neonatal hypothermia. Effective allied health interventions include acceptance and commitment therapy, action observations, bimanual training, casting, constraint-induced movement therapy, environmental enrichment, fitness training, goal-directed training, hippotherapy, home programs, literacy interventions, mobility training, oral sensorimotor, oral sensorimotor plus electrical stimulation, pressure care, stepping stones triple P, strength training, task-specific training, treadmill training, partial body weight support treadmill training, and weight-bearing. Effective medical and surgical interventions include anti-convulsants, bisphosphonates, botulinum toxin, botulinum toxin plus occupational therapy, botulinum toxin plus casting, diazepam, dentistry, hip surveillance, intrathecal baclofen, scoliosis correction, selective dorsal rhizotomy, and umbilical cord blood cell therapy.

297,35948447,Neurology,Leisure Activities and the Risk of Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Leisure activities are major components of modifiable and healthy lifestyles and are proposed to help prevent the development of dementia. This study aimed to assess the effects of different types of leisure activities, including cognitive, physical, and social activities, on the incidence of all-cause dementia (ACD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and vascular dementia (VD). METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the Cochrane, PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases to identify longitudinal studies that examined associations between leisure activities and dementia. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% CIs were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were used to estimate potential effect modifiers. The study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42019116857). RESULTS: A total of 38 longitudinal studies, with 2,154,818 participants at baseline, 74,700 ACD cases, 2,848 AD cases, and 1,423 VD cases during follow-up, were included in the meta-analysis. The subgroup analyses showed that physical (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.78-0.88), cognitive (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.68-0.87), and social (RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87-0.99) activities were associated with a decreased incidence of ACD. In addition, physical (RR 0.87; 95% CI 0.78-0.96) and cognitive (RR 0.66; 95% CI 0.52-0.85) activities were related to a reduced risk of AD. Physical activity (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.53-0.85) was associated with a lower incidence of VD. DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that leisure activities are inversely associated with a risk of ACD, AD, and VD.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
298,19284431,J Clin Nurs,"A literature review of the application of the Geriatric Depression Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist to community nursing cohorts","AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: To explore through literature review the appropriateness of three common tools for use by community nurses to screen war veteran and war widow(er) clients for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. BACKGROUND: War veterans and, to a lesser extent, war widow(er)s, are prone to mental health challenges, especially depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Community nurses do not accurately identify such people with depression and related disorders although they are well positioned to do so. The use of valid and reliable self-report tools is one method of improving nurses' identification of people with actual or potential mental health difficulties for referral to a general practitioner or mental health practitioner for diagnostic assessment and treatment. The Geriatric Depression Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist are frequently recommended for mental health screening but the appropriateness of using the tools for screening war veteran and war widow(er) community nursing clients who are often aged and have functional impairment, is unknown. DESIGN: Systematic review. CONCLUSIONS: Current literature informs that the Geriatric Depression Scale accurately predicts a diagnosis of depression in community nursing cohorts. The three Depression Anxiety Stress Scales subscales of depression, anxiety and stress are valid; however, no studies were identified that compared the performance of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales in predicting diagnoses of depression or anxiety. The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist predicts post-traumatic stress disorder in community cohorts although no studies meeting the selection criteria included male participants. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This review provides recommendations for the use of the Geriatric Depression Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales and The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist based on examination of the published evidence for the application of these screening tools in samples approximated to community nursing cohorts. Findings and recommendations would guide community nurses, managers and health planners in the selection of mental health screening tools to promote holistic community nursing care.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
299,27184287,Adv Nutr,The Effects of Breakfast and Breakfast Composition on Cognition in Children and Adolescents: A Systematic Review,"Breakfast is thought to be beneficial for cognitive and academic performance in school children. However, breakfast is the most frequently skipped meal, especially among adolescents. The aim of the current article was to systematically review the evidence from intervention studies for the effects of breakfast on cognitive performance in children and adolescents. The effects of breakfast were evaluated by cognitive domain and breakfast manipulation. A total of 45 studies reported in 43 articles were included in the review. Most studies considered the acute effect of a single breakfast (n = 34). The acute studies looked at breakfast compared with no breakfast (n = 24) and/or comparisons of breakfast type (n = 15). The effects of chronic school breakfast program interventions were evaluated in 11 studies. The findings suggest that breakfast consumption relative to fasting has a short-term (same morning) positive domain-specific effect on cognition. Tasks requiring attention, executive function, and memory were facilitated more reliably by breakfast consumption relative to fasting, with effects more apparent in undernourished children. Firm conclusions cannot be made about the acute effects of breakfast composition and the effects of chronic breakfast interventions because there are too few studies and these largely report inconsistent findings. This review also highlights methodologic limitations of the existing research. These include a lack of research on adolescents, few naturalistic breakfast manipulations or testing environments, small samples, and insensitive cognitive tests.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
300,22309074,Physical & occupational therapy in pediatrics,Reproducibility of tactile assessments for children with unilateral cerebral palsy.,"A systematic review identified tactile assessments used in children with cerebral palsy (CP), but their reproducibility is unknown. Sixteen children with unilateral CP and 31 typically developing children (TDC) were assessed 2-4 weeks apart. Test-retest percent agreements within one point for children with unilateral CP (and TDC) were Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments: 75% (90%); single-point localization: 69% (97%); static two-point discrimination: 93% (97%); and moving two-point discrimination: 87% (97%). Test-retest reliability for registration and unilateral spatial tactile perception tests was high in children with CP (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.79-0.96). Two tests demonstrated a learning effect for children with CP, double simultaneous and tactile texture perception. Stereognosis had a ceiling effect for TDC (ICC = 0) and variability for children with CP (% exact agreement = 47%-50%). The Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments, single-point localization, and both static and moving two-point discrimination are recommended for use in practice and research. Although recommended to provide a comprehensive assessment, the measures of double simultaneous, stereognosis, and tactile texture perception may not be responsive to change over time in children with unilateral CP.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

A systematic review of approaches to benzodiazepine discontinuation in general practice and out-patient settings was undertaken. Routine care was compared with three treatment approaches: brief interventions, gradual dose reduction (GDR) and psychological interventions. GDR was compared with GDR plus psychological interventions or substitutive pharmacotherapies.	Inclusion criteria were met by 24 studies, and a further eight were identified by future search. GDR [odds ratio (OR) = 5.96, confidence interval (CI) = 2.08-17.11] and brief interventions (OR = 4.37, CI = 2.28-8.40) provided superior cessation rates at post-treatment to routine care. Psychological treatment plus GDR were superior to both routine care (OR = 3.38, CI = 1.86-6.12) and GDR alone (OR = 1.82, CI = 1.25-2.67). However, substitutive pharmacotherapies did not add to the impact of GDR (OR = 1.30, CI = 0.97-1.73), and abrupt substitution of benzodiazepines by other pharmacotherapy was less effective than GDR alone (OR = 0.30, CI = 0.14-0.64). Few studies on any technique had significantly greater benzodiazepine discontinuation than controls at follow-up.	Providing an intervention is more effective than routine care. Psychological interventions may improve discontinuation above GDR alone. While some substitutive pharmacotherapies may have promise, current evidence is insufficient to support their use.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
302,36423207,J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol,Blood Biomarkers for the Diagnosis of Neurodegenerative Dementia: A Systematic Review,"IMPORTANCE: Accurately diagnosing neurodegenerative dementia is often challenging due to overlapping clinical features. Disease specific biomarkers could enhance diagnostic accuracy. However, CSF analysis procedures and advanced imaging modalities are either invasive or high-priced, and routinely unavailable. Easily accessible disease biomarkers would be of utmost value for accurate differential diagnosis of dementia subtypes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of blood-based biomarkers for the differential diagnosis of AD from Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD), or AD from Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB). METHODS: Systematic review. Three databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched. Studies assessing blood-based biomarkers levels in AD versus FTLD, or AD versus DLB, and its diagnostic accuracy, were selected. When the same biomarker was assessed in three or more studies, a meta-analysis was performed. QUADAS-2 criteria were used for quality assessment. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included in this analysis. Collectively, 905 AD patients were compared to 1262 FTLD patients, and 209 AD patients were compared to 246 DLB patients. Regarding biomarkers for AD versus FTLD, excellent discriminative accuracy (AUC >0.9) was found for p-tau181, p-tau217, synaptophysin, synaptopodin, GAP43 and calmodulin. Other biomarkers also demonstrated good accuracy (AUC = 0.8-0.9). For AD versus DLB distinction, only miR-21-5p and miR-451a achieved excellent accuracy (AUC >0.9). CONCLUSION: Encouraging results were found for several biomarkers, alone or in combination. Prospective longitudinal designs and consensual protocols, comprising larger cohorts and homogeneous testing modalities across centres, are essential to validate the clinical value of blood biomarkers for the precise etiological diagnosis of dementia.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
303,33326573,Gerontologist,Person-Centered Care in Persons Living With Dementia: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The concept of person-centered care has been utilized/adapted to various interventions to enhance health-related outcomes and ensure the quality of care delivered to persons living with dementia. A few systematic reviews have been conducted on the use of person-centered interventions in the context of dementia care, but to date, none have analyzed intervention effect by intervention type and target outcome. This study aimed to review person-centered interventions used in the context of dementia care and examine their effectiveness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. We searched through 5 databases for randomized controlled trials that utilized person-centered interventions in persons living with dementia from 1998 to 2019. Study quality was assessed using the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence checklist. The outcomes of interest for the meta-analysis were behavioral and psychological symptoms in dementia (BPSD) and cognitive function assessed immediately after the baseline measurement. RESULTS: In total, 36 studies were systematically reviewed. Intervention types were reminiscence, music, and cognitive therapies, and multisensory stimulation. Thirty studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results showed a moderate effect size for overall intervention, a small one for music therapy, and a moderate one for reminiscence therapy on BPSD and cognitive function. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Generally speaking, person-centered interventions showed immediate intervention effects on reducing BPSD and improving cognitive function, although the effect size and significance of each outcome differed by intervention type. Thus, health care providers should consider person-centered interventions as a vital element in dementia care.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
304,30842305,Journal of neurointerventional surgery,Endovascular mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke in young children.,"Mechanical thrombectomy has emerged as a standard of care for acute stroke from large vessel occlusion in adults but remains controversial in children. Cerebral vessels are nearly adult size by 5 years of age but the technical feasibility of achieving recanalization in younger and smaller children with current endovascular tools remains unclear.	To systematically review the literature on mechanical thrombectomy for stroke in children less than 5 years of age.	Mechanical thrombectomy for acute stroke has been reported in 11 children under the age of 5 years (range 9 months to 4 years). The mean time from symptom onset to groin puncture was 12 hours (range 4-50 hours). Complete recanalization was achieved in 7/12 (58%) vessels attempted, and partial recanalization in 4/12 (33%). Two procedure related complications were reported, with small vessel size felt to be contributory to basilar vasospasm in one case. Favorable neurological outcomes were reported in 7 cases (64%).	Our review of the literature demonstrates that mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke may be feasible in carefully selected infants and young children less than 5 years of age using currently available devices. Efficacy in promoting better neurologic outcomes remains unproven, and other questions persist, including whether complications such as vasospasm occur more frequently in young children compared with adults. Further study is needed to determine the safety and efficacy of pediatric mechanical thrombectomy. These data suggest that young children should not be excluded from future studies or clinical treatment on the basis of age alone.",Human-systematic-review,7,0

OBJECTIVE: To provide surgeons and other health care professionals with guidelines for surgical reconstruction of metastatic spine disease based on evidence and expert opinion. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: The surgical treatment of spinal metastases is controversial. Specifically two aspects of surgical reconstruction are addressed in this study: (i) choice of bone graft used during surgery for metastatic spine tumors and (ii) the design of reconstruction or construct to stabilize. METHODS: A systematic review of the available medical literature from 1980 to 2015 was conducted, and combined with consensus expert opinion from a recent survey of spine surgeons who treat metastatic spine tumors. RESULTS: There is very little evidence in the literature to provide guidance on the use of bone graft in metastatic tumor reconstruction. There is little evidence in the literature to support the preferential use of one graft type over the other. Approximately, 41% of respondents said they used bone graft or bone graft substitutes to accomplish fusion. There were 17 studies that described the use of a prefabricated prosthetic, 10 studies describing the use of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) bone cement, and only three studies describing the use of bone graft for anterior column reconstruction. The use of structural allograft was most popular among the experts for anterior reconstruction, followed by cage reconstruction, and PMMA bone cement. CONCLUSION: Achieving bony union may be of importance for the maintenance of spinal stability in the long term after reconstruction. Whether bony union is required for patients with shorter life expectancies is debatable. The literature supports the use of anterior reconstruction with either a prefabricated prosthetic or PMMA bone cement. It also supports the use of an anterior construct reinforced with bilateral posterior instrumentation when performing a three-column reconstruction.

307,34871380,Eur J Prev Cardiol,Statin use and risk of dementia or Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"AIMS: As the potential impact of statins on cognitive decline and dementia is still debated, we conducted a meta-analysis of observational studies to examine the effect of statin use on the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. METHODS AND RESULTS: PubMed, Cochrane, and EMBASE were searched since inception to January 2021. Inclusion criteria were: (i) cohort or case-control studies; (ii) statin users compared to non-users; and (iii) AD and/or dementia risk as outcome. Estimates from original studies were pooled using restricted maximum-likelihood random-effect model. Measure of effects were reported as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). In the pooled analyses, statins were associated with a decreased risk of dementia [36 studies, OR 0.80 (CI 0.75-0.86)] and of AD [21 studies, OR 0.68 (CI 0.56-0.81)]. In the stratified analysis by sex, no difference was observed in the risk reduction of dementia between men [OR 0.86 (CI 0.81-0.92)] and women [OR 0.86 (CI 0.81-0.92)]. Similar risks were observed for lipophilic and hydrophilic statins for both dementia and AD, while high-potency statins showed a 20% reduction of dementia risk compared with a 16% risk reduction associated with low-potency statins, suggesting a greater efficacy of the former, although a borderline statistical significance (P = 0.05) for the heterogeneity between estimates. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the absence of a neurocognitive risk associated with statin treatment and suggest a potential favourable role of statins. Randomized clinical trials with an ad hoc design are needed to explore this potential neuroprotective effect.",Human-systematic-review,7,0
308,31778847,Addictive behaviors,Voices of hope: A feasibility study of telephone recovery support.,"Substance use disorders (SUDs) are chronic disorders frequently managed with crisis stabilization or short-term treatment. To improve rates of sustained remission from SUD, there is a need to shift the existing treatment paradigm away from an acute care model and toward a model of ongoing recovery management. Telephone recovery support (TRS) is a promising recovery management tool, consisting of weekly calls from volunteers, including peer workers, to people in recovery to offer support and connect participants with resources. The aim of this study was to evaluate feasibility and acceptability of a TRS program in Central Kentucky, United States.	Participants (n = 506) were recruited for the program from a variety of settings, such as sober living/halfway houses, drug court, residential treatment transitional living, and outpatient and intensive outpatient treatment. For each call, participant status (e.g., experiencing psychosocial stressors, concerned about relapse) was recorded. To assess acceptability, we performed semi-structured interviews with participants (n = 7), which were subsequently transcribed and analyzed via content analysis.	Volunteers completed 35.7% of calls (a completed call was defined as either answered or returned) with 88% of participants reporting being okay, 9% reporting psychosocial stressors, and 3% reporting relapse or concerns about relapse. Participants reported that TRS provided a felt sense of support and consistent recovery engagement, and appreciated that volunteers took the initiative to reach out to them. Multiple participants reported a desire to increase the frequency of TRS contact.	TRS holds promise as a resource to promote long-term recovery support. More research is needed to determine the efficacy and adequate dosing of TRS calls.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new site-specific, manual soft-tissue therapy in increasing orgasm and reducing dyspareunia (painful intercourse) in women with histories indicating abdominopelvic adhesion formation. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: A total of 29 new patients presenting with infertility or abdominopelvic pain-related problems, and also indicating sexual pain or dysfunction, received a series of treatments (mean, 19.5 hours) designed to address biomechanical dysfunction and restricted mobility due to adhesions affecting the reproductive organs and adjacent structures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were post-test vs pretest scores on: (1) the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) full scale, orgasm domain, and pain domain; and (2) 3 supplemental 10-point rating scales of sexual pain levels. Secondary outcome measures were post-test vs pretest scores in the other 4 FSFI domains (desire, arousal, lubrication, and satisfaction). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for all statistical analyses. RESULTS: For the 23 patients available for follow-up, the paired FSFI post-test vs pretest scores were significant (P < or = .003) on all measures. Of the 17 patients who completed the 3 sexual pain scales, the paired post-test vs pretest scores were significant (P < or = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Many cases of inhibited orgasm, dyspareunia, and other aspects of sexual dysfunction seem to be treatable by a distinctive, noninvasive manual therapy with no risks and few, if any, adverse effects. The therapy should be considered a new adjunct to existing gynecologic and medical treatments.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

To report our single-centre preliminary experience, focusing on feasibility, safety and short-term efficacy of this procedure.	Patients implanted from December 2013 to February 2014 were included. The procedure, performed under general anaesthesia, was guided by fluoroscopy and transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Efficacy was defined as the ability to implant the WM with no peridevice leak; safety was defined as the occurrence of in-hospital and 45-day events, including stroke, pericardial effusion and device migration.	Twenty-three patients (mean age: 77.6 years; 16 men [69.6%]; mean CHA2DS2-VASc score: 5) underwent WM implantation. The indication was gastrointestinal bleeding in 14 (60.9%) patients, cerebral haemorrhage in eight (34.8%) and need for long-term ticagrelor after stent thrombosis on clopidgrel in one (4.3%). Procedural success was 95.7% (95% confidence interval: 77.3-100.0); efficacy was 90.9% (95% confidence interval: 71.0-98.7). The size of the implanted WATCHMAN™ device was in agreement with the prespecified size, based on measurement of the LAA, in 56.5% of cases. In five cases, the criteria were not met, but the device was successfully implanted in four of these, with a good result (80.0%). Treatment at discharge was a reduced dose of anticoagulant plus aspirin in three cases (13.0%) or antiplatelet therapy alone in 20 cases (90.9%). No adverse event occurred during the index hospitalization or at 45 days. At 45 days, the LAA was sealed in 18/19 patients (94.7%) on TOE, with no difference between those who did or did not have an implanted device of the prespecified size.	When performed by an operator trained in the procedure, WM implantation appears to be safe and effective. This procedure may be considered in patients at high-risk of stroke who are ineligible for long-term OAC.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Treatment in supine position including field verification as a prerequisite for anesthesia without intubation.,"For craniospinal axis irradiation in young children sometimes anesthesia is required. In order to minimize risks from the anesthesist's point of view supine position would be preferable to standard prone position. In case of irradiation in supine position verification of the 3-field junction in the cervical region causes problems, because there is no direct visual control. For such situations the clinical application of a new technique is presented.	For treatment planning a modern 3D planning system was necessary. Patient's positioning was done by using a vacuum-form body immobilizer and an integrated head mask. Radiation fields were placed only by table movements being calculated by the planning system in relation to a reference point at the patient's surface. In addition to common verification films specially prepared small films were used for the 3-field junction in the cervical region. These films were placed close to the patient for the whole time of each radiation session being exposed by every radiation field.	Two children (age 3 and 5 years, respectively) were irradiated as described. Twenty-eight of those specially prepared films were exposed. Two films (7%) had to be excluded because of inadequate exposure. An overlap of radiation fields was seen on 1 of the 26 remaining films (4%), whereas an unacceptable gap was not found. Acute skin reactions were comparable to those observed in patients being irradiated in standard prone position.	The presented technique for craniospinal axis irradiation in supine position including field verification was not only precise and reproducable, but also comfortable and safe for the patient. We suggest it as a new option for craniospinal axis irradiation in children.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A concomitant effect of multilevel fusion is a restriction of cervical spine mobility. This retrospective study on DCM-patients with at least 4 laminectomy and fusion levels, compares data between objective and subjective restriction of the postoperative cervical spine mobility. The patient-reported restriction of cervical spine mobility was acquired by a five-step score. Measurements of cervical range of motion were performed using the CROM device and were correlated with the subjective scores. Fusion was performed over 6 levels in most of the 36 patients. For the subjective cervical spine mobility, 52.8% reported none to medium, 38.9% severe and 8.3% complete restriction. Mean objective cervical range of motion was 45.0° for flexion-extension, 26.3° for total lateral flexion and 51.4° for total rotation and therefore evidently reduced compared to non-operated patient cohorts in literature. There was a significant medium, negative correlation between the objective measurements and the patient-reported general restriction of cervical spine mobility, and with the physical component summary of SF-8. The significant objective reduction of cervical range of motion after laminectomy and multilevel fusion correlates with the patient-reported assessment for general restriction.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
313,24714669,PloS one,Disturbed small-world networks and neurocognitive function in frontal lobe low-grade glioma patients.,"Brain tumor patients often associated with losses of the small-world configuration and neurocognitive functions before operations. However, few studies were performed on the impairments of frontal lobe low-grade gliomas (LGG) after tumor resection using small-world network features.	To detect differences in the whole brain topology among LGG patients before and after operation, a combined study of neurocognitive assessment and graph theoretical network analysis of fMRI data was performed. We collected resting-state fMRI data of 12 carefully selected frontal lobe LGG patients before and after operation. We calculated the topological properties of brain functional networks in the 12 LGG, and compared with 12 healthy controls (HCs). We also applied Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) in a subset of patients (n = 12, including before and after operation groups) and HCs (n = 12). The resulting functional connectivity matrices were constructed for all 12 patients, and binary network analysis was performed. In the range of 0.05 ≤ Kcos t ≤ 0.35, the functional networks in preoperative LGG and postoperative one both fitted the definition of small-worldness. We proposed Knet = 0.20 as small-world network interval, and the results showed that the topological properties were found to be disrupted in the two LGG groups, meanwhile the global efficiency increased and the local efficiency decreased. Lnet in the two LGG groups both were longer than HCs. Cnet in the LGG groups were smaller than HCs. Compared with the Hcs, MoCA in the two LGG groups were lower than HCs with significant difference, and the disturbed networks in the LGG were negatively related to worse MoCA scores.	Disturbed small-worldness preperty in the two LGG groups was found and widely spread in the strength and spatial organization of brain networks, and the alterated small-world network may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction in frontal lobe LGG patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Supplementum,Schizophrenia--a national emergency: preliminary observations on SANELINE.,"In May 1992 the British mental health charity SANE inaugurated a telephone helpline for people suffering from or copying with severe mental illness. From its first days the line has been inundated by people needing information and help about their illness. The line is open from 1400 to midnight every day of the year, and is manned by almost 100 trained volunteers supervised by professional staff. In total more than 100,000 people have called the SANELINE number since it opened. For every call taken, a detailed log is written up immediately. The service is, of course, confidential. We recognized even before the line was opened that these logs would provide unique information on which a wide range of research could be based.

A single center experience.,"Information about extrapulmonary small cell carcinoma (EPSCC) is limited and the role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) is unknown.	Disease presentation and outcome of all EPSCC at our hospital between 1990 and 2009 were retrospectively analyzed.	Of 30 EPSCC, the male:female ratio was 58%:42%; 83% had a performance status of 0-2. Median age was 71 years (32-80). Seventeen (57%) had limited stage (LS), 13 (43%) extensive stage (ES). The location of the primary tumor was gastrointestinal (n = 8), unknown (6), gynecological (6), urogenital (5), and ear nose throat (5). Four (13%) developed brain metastases (2 ES, 2 LS). In ES, first line chemotherapy (CT) was given in 85%, mostly platinum-etoposide (64%). Response rate was 90%. In LS, CT and radiotherapy (RT) ± resection resulted in persistent remissions in 67% of patients. Median survival was 16 months (1-107 months), 18 months (1-107 months), and 9 months (0.4-25 months) for LS + ES, LS, and ES, respectively. Weight loss ≥5 % and ECOG performance status 3 + 4 were associated with poorer survival (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively).	The incidence of brain metastases was relatively low (13%). More studies are necessary, before routinely offering PCI to patients with EPSCC. Best survival outcomes in LS were achieved with multimodality treatment including CT and RT.

EVT records in 2010-2019 were screened. Exclusion criteria included the occurrence of immediate post-procedural intracranial haemorrhage (ICH). Hyperdense areas on iodine overlay maps were scored according to the Alberta Stroke Programme Early CT Score (ASPECTS), thus forming a CE-ASPECTS. Maximum parenchymal iodine concentration and maximum iodine concentration relative to the torcula were recorded. Follow-up imaging was reviewed for ICH. The primary outcome measure was the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 90 days.	Out of 651 records, 402 patients were included. CE was found in 318 patients (79%). Thirty-five patients developed ICH on follow-up imaging. Fourteen ICHs were symptomatic. Stroke progression occurred in 59 patients. Multivariable regression showed a significant association between decreasing CE-ASPECTS and the mRS at 90 days (adjusted (a)cOR: 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18), NIHSS at 24-48 h (aβ: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.29-0.84), stroke progression (aOR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.03-1.26) and ICH (aOR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.06-1.39), but not symptomatic ICH (aOR 1.19, 95% CI: 0.95-1.38). Iodine concentration was significantly associated with the mRS (acOR: 1.18, 95% CI: 1.06-1.32), NIHSS (aβ: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.30-1.06), ICH (aOR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.04-1.81) and symptomatic ICH (aOR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02-1.38), but not stroke progression (aOR: 0.99, 95% CI: 0.86-1.15). Results of the analyses with relative iodine concentration were similar and did not improve prediction.	CE-ASPECTS and iodine concentration are both associated with short- and long-term stroke outcomes. CE-ASPECTS is likely a better predictor for stroke progression.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
318,25929206,Spine,A Comparison of Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion Combined With Artificial Disc Replacement and Cage Fusion in Patients With Multilevel Cervical Spondylotic Myelopathy.,"A retrospective study.	The aim of this study was to compare clinical and radiological outcomes of anterior cervical corpectomy and fusion (ACCF) combined with artificial disc replacement (C-ADR) and ACCF combined with anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) in patients with consecutive 3-level cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM).	The optimal surgical strategy for multilevel CSM (MCSM) remains undefined. C-ADR maintains motion at the level of the surgical procedure and decreases strain on the adjacent segments. The clinical results of multilevel C-ADR have not yet been elucidated. ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR for the treatment of consecutive 3-level CSM may be a reasonable alternative to 3-level fusion.	We retrospectively reviewed the histories of patients who underwent surgery for consecutive 3-level CSM between C3-4 and C6-7 from June 2007 to August 2011. A total of 42 patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A (n = 19) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level C-ADR; group B (n = 23) underwent ACCF combined with 1-level ACDF. We compared perioperative parameters, clinical parameters, and radiological parameters.	There were no significant differences in the average age, sex ratio, the preoperative heights of the disc space or average blood loss between the 2 groups. Group A had longer operation times than group B (P < 0.05). During the follow-up period, group A showed a better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery (P < 0.05) at 24 months postoperatively, and less visual analogue scale scores at 12 and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Moreover, group A exhibited better C2-C7 range of motion recovery at 6, 12, and 24 months postoperatively (P < 0.05, respectively).	Group A was superior to Group B in terms of better Neck Dysfunction Index recovery, less intermediate term pain, and better C2-C7 ROM recovery. ACCF hybrid 1-level C-ADR may be a suitable choice for the management of 3-level CSM in appropriate patients.	3.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

A Multicenter Retrospective Comparative Analysis.,"Surgery in patients with highly eloquent glioblastoma (GB) remains challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate influence of use of intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging (iMRI) on extent of resection (EOR), clinical outcome, and survival in patients with preoperatively intended subtotal resection of GB.	Retrospective assessment was performed in 3 neurosurgical centers (2008-2013). All patients with primary GB, unilocular growth, and adjuvant radiochemotherapy in whom subtotal resection was intended were included. Imaging data were pseudonymized and volumetrically assessed by a central reviewer. Clinical outcome was evaluated based on complications, new permanent neurologic deficits, and survival. Based on subtraction of potential EOR (as defined by reviewer) from effective EOR, EOR change (ΔEOR) was calculated for each case. We calculated multivariate linear regressions to assess influence on effective EOR and ΔEOR, binary regressions to assess influence on complications and new permanent neurologic deficits, and Cox regression models to assess survival.	Assessment included 70 patients. In iMRI group, a significantly lower ΔEOR (4% vs. 22%, P = 0.008) was found. In linear regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, only iMRI influenced ΔEOR significantly (P = 0.03, odds ratio 0.27). In binary regression model controlling for age, tumor volume, effective EOR, neurophysiologic mapping, and iMRI, none of the variables showed a significant difference concerning complications and new permanent neurologic deficits. Overall survival was significantly influenced by age (P = 0.03, odds ratio 1.02) and iMRI (P = 0.026, odds ratio 0.51).	Maximum safe resection is an important prognostic factor for patients with eloquent GBs. iMRI seems to be a relevant tool to achieve this goal.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

This study investigates whether IMRS can be an adequate dosimetric alternative to DCARS for cranial stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).	Forty-five SRS procedures for solitary brain metastasis (range: 0.44-29.18 cm 3) performed at our institution were selected for this study. Two plans were generated per patient: One IMRS plan using a multileaf collimation (MLC) of 5 mm, and one DCARS plan designed with a 3 mm micro-MLC. Dosimetric comparison metrics include the target coverage (Cov), conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), gradient index (GI), and volume of the normal brain tissue receiving ≥12 Gy (V12). In addition, maximum doses to organs at risk (OAR) (brainstem, optic apparatus and cochlea) were compared for both techniques.	Compared to DCARS, IMRS improved mean CI (IMRS: 0.81 vs.	0.63, P < 0.001), with no significant difference in target Cov (IMRS: 0.99 vs.	0.99, P > 0.05), HI (IMRS: 1.22 vs.	1.24, P > 0.05), GI (IMRS: 5.44 vs.	5.44, P > 0.05). A weak significant difference in V12 (IMRS: 4.6 cm 3 vs. 5.2 cm 3, P = 0.033) was obtained. Subgroup analysis per target volume (small: <1 cm 3, intermediate: ≤1 cm 3 and <5 cm 3 and large: ≥5 cm 3) only revealed the statistically difference for CI metric (P < 0.001). No significant differences were found for maximum dose to the OAR.	We have shown that IMRS provides the dosimetric advantages compared with DCARS. Based on the dosimetric findings in this study, fixed gantry IMRS technique can be adopted as a standard procedure for cranial SRS when micro-MLC technology is not available on the linear accelerator.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
323,31875461,Disability and rehabilitation,A short work-directed rehabilitation to promote work capacity while depressed and anxious: a qualitative study of workers' experiences.,"Most people with common mental disorders are working despite symptoms. This study explores individuals' experiences of a work-directed rehabilitation, provided by occupational therapists and physiotherapists, aiming to promote work capacity in persons with common mental disorders.	A qualitative content analysis was used, and 11 women and 8 men with depression or anxiety disorder were interviewed. They were 25-66 years old, had different occupations and were working full or part-time.	The participants experienced a process interpreted as Increasing belief in one's capacity through supported reflection and practice. This theme reflects the shifting between 'reflecting' and 'doing' through rehabilitation and the growing hope for change. The increasing belief in one's capacity was developed through three stages, comprised of the categories To be supported by a professional, To realise things about oneself and To try new strategies for change.	Strategies suggested by occupational therapists and physiotherapists have the potential to promote work capacity in people who are working while depressed and anxious. The results may deepen the understanding among rehabilitation professionals about the importance of a person-centred approach to people with common mental disorders, and to combine reflection and practical exercises to support the development of work-related strategies.Implications for rehabilitationWork-directed rehabilitation provided by occupational therapists and/or physiotherapists is beneficial to people with common mental disorders.Rehabilitation professionals should focus on facilitating self-efficacy among people with common mental disorders.An individualised person-centred approach seems important in order to initiate change.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
324,33667828,Journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry,Change talk and sustain talk in treatment of generalized anxiety disorder: A secondary analysis of cognitive behavioral therapy and metacognitive therapy in adult outpatients.,"Measures of patient motivation have proven elusive, showing inconsistent results in relation to psychotherapy outcome. How patients talk about change is an alternative measure of motivation, with potential value in predicting treatment outcome. This study had two aims: (1) to examine if change talk and sustain talk (including its subcategories) predicted reduction in worry levels at post-treatment and 2-year follow-up, and (2) if there were differences between the cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and metacognitive therapy (MCT) conditions with respect to change talk.	This study investigated 24 patients receiving CBT and 27 patients receiving MCT for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), and coded patients' utterances in sessions 1 and 4.	Change talk was significantly associated with lower worry levels at post-treatment and 2-year follow-up, beyond initial worry severity and treatment condition. Change talk in session 4, and reduction in sustain talk from session 1 to 4, was positively associated with improvement, whilst sustain talk in session 4 showed a negative relationship. More specifically, commitment statements in session 1 and expressing signs of taking steps at session 4 were associated with reduction in worry levels. Moreover, patients in the MCT condition argued more both for and against change during session 1, but not session 4.	The sample size was relatively small.	These results indicate that change talk sustain talk could be important in the treatment of GAD.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The influence of recanalization on DST outcome has not yet been thoroughly evaluated.	Thirty-seven consecutive patients with DST were prospectively examined. Neurological deficits were graded with the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) on hospital admission and discharge. Functional outcome was assessed with the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) on hospital discharge and after 12 months. All patients were treated with intravenous heparin in the acute stage of illness, followed by oral anticoagulation for 12 months. Imaging follow-up with MR angiography and, in a few cases, with CT or conventional angiography was performed on hospital discharge and after 6 and 12 months.	Twelve-month functional outcome was excellent in 89% of patients with an mRS of 0 or 1. A recanalization rate of 60% was already observed on hospital discharge (22+/-6 days); thereafter, recanalization rates increased insignificantly. Early recanalization was not related to NIHSS score on hospital discharge or an mRS of 0 on discharge or after 12 months.	We found a high frequency of early recanalization but without influence on clinical outcome parameters.

327,28403387,JAMA psychiatry,Skin Conductance Responses and Neural Activations During Fear Conditioning and Extinction Recall Across Anxiety Disorders.,"The fear conditioning and extinction neurocircuitry has been extensively studied in healthy and clinical populations, with a particular focus on posttraumatic stress disorder. Despite significant overlap of symptoms between posttraumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorders, the latter has received less attention. Given that dysregulated fear levels characterize anxiety disorders, examining the neural correlates of fear and extinction learning may shed light on the pathogenesis of underlying anxiety disorders.	To investigate the psychophysiological and neural correlates of fear conditioning and extinction recall in anxiety disorders and to document how these features differ as a function of multiple diagnoses or anxiety severity.	This investigation was a cross-sectional, case-control, functional magnetic resonance imaging study at an academic medical center. Participants were healthy controls and individuals with at least 1 of the following anxiety disorders: generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and panic disorder. The study dates were between March 2013 and May 2015.	Two-day fear conditioning and extinction paradigm.	Skin conductance responses, blood oxygenation level-dependent responses, trait anxiety scores from the State Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait Form, and functional connectivity.	This study included 21 healthy controls (10 women) and 61 individuals with anxiety disorders (36 women). P values reported for the neuroimaging results are all familywise error corrected. Skin conductance responses during extinction recall did not differ between individuals with anxiety disorders and healthy controls (ηp2 = 0.001, P = .79), where ηp2 is partial eta squared. The anxiety group had lower activation of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) during extinction recall (ηp2 = 0.178, P = .02). A similar hypoactive pattern was found during early conditioning (ηp2 = 0.106, P = .009). The vmPFC hypoactivation was associated with anxiety symptom severity (r = -0.420, P = .01 for conditioning and r = -0.464, P = .004 for extinction recall) and the number of co-occuring anxiety disorders diagnosed (ηp2 = 0.137, P = .009 for conditioning and ηp2 = 0.227, P = .004 for extinction recall). Psychophysiological interaction analyses revealed that the fear network connectivity differed between healthy controls and the anxiety group during fear learning (ηp2 range between 0.088 and 0.176 and P range between 0.02 and 0.003) and extinction recall (ηp2 range between 0.111 and 0.235 and P range between 0.02 and 0.002).	Despite no skin conductance response group differences during extinction recall, brain activation patterns between anxious and healthy individuals differed. These findings encourage future studies to examine the conditions longitudinally and in the context of treatment trials to improve and guide therapeutics via advanced neurobiological understanding of each disorder.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Therefore, they would benefit from teaching procedures that minimize their difficulties in acquiring these relations. This study compared two teaching procedures, an error prevention procedure and an error correction procedure, for teaching relations between objects and pictures.	Participants were two groups of children with autism, aged between 3 and 7 years. In the context of picture-to-object requesting, one group was taught using an error correction method and the other group with an error prevention method. The measures for each child were accuracy of correspondences between taught picture and object pairs and accuracy of delayed correspondences in learning outcome tests with all combinations of object and picture pairs presented to them throughout the study.	The group receiving the error prevention-based teaching made significantly fewer errors during the teaching phases and in their learning outcome test for correspondences between all combinations of pictures and objects.	The error prevention teaching procedure would seem to provide a more efficient and ecologically valid method than the error correction procedure for teaching relations between objects and their graphic-based referents. Improvements in the methodology were suggested for providing a stronger basis for comparison between error correction and error prevention teaching methods.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Between April 1994 and August 2000, 450 patients (270 men; mean age 70.2 years, range 27-89) had stents implanted to treat 472 cervical carotid artery stenoses. Over half (257, 57%) of the patients were symptomatic. A variety of stents were implanted percutaneously after predilation of the lesion; a third of the patients received glycoprotein IIb/ IIIa inhibitors intraprocedurally in addition to a standard oral antiplatelet regimen (aspirin and ticlopidine or clopidogrel). Occurrence and management of neurological complications within the 30-day periprocedural period were reviewed.	There were 14 (3.1%) transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), 10 (2.2%) minor strokes, and 3 (0.7%) major strokes. Among 6 (1.3%) procedure-related deaths, 4 had neurological causes. The total stroke and death rate was 4.2% (n = 19). All the TIAs, 4 of which occurred between 1 and 14 days poststenting, were treated medically, as were the minor strokes, 3 of which occurred >24 hours after stenting. Only 2 minor stroke patients had mild residual upper extremity motor deficits. Intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy was administered in 5 cases (2 major strokes survivors and 3 patients who suffered a neurologically-related death); occlusions were identified in the proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) in 3 and the distal MCA in 2. Angiographic improvement was noted in 4 (80%), but only the 2 (40%) with distal MCA occlusions did well clinically.	Neurological complications following carotid artery stenting are inevitable. The occurrence of minor strokes >24 hours following stenting may indicate a possible late embolic phenomenon, which warrants investigation. Likewise, the marginal efficacy of intra-arterial thrombolytic therapy demonstrates an inability to lyse embolic plaque and underscores the need for effective distal protection.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a reasonable alternative for inoperable or high-risk lesions requiring treatment. Few series evaluate overall results that include data from both modalities as they more often focus on their treatment method of choice. In this study, we evaluated our AVM database of 129 patients seen over the past eight years at our institution: 73 were treated with microsurgery (57%) while 37 (29%) were treated with SRS. We reviewed angiographic obliteration rates, complication rates, and outcome data, excluding seven patients treated with SRS as they did not have at least two years of angiographic follow-up. Patients undergoing microsurgery had smaller AVM (mean 2.2 cm compared to 3.5 cm for SRS), a smaller proportion of eloquent AVM (53% compared to 83% for SRS), a greater proportion of AVM with superficial drainage only (75% compared to 40% for SRS), and more grade 1 and 2 AVM (78% compared to 17% for SRS). The overall obliteration rate was 80%: 92% for microsurgery and 50% for SRS. The latter increased to 92% for AVM <3 cm, but the obliteration rate was 18% for those AVM >3 cm. Transient complications, including post-SRS hemorrhage, were seen in 11% of patients overall (8% after microsurgery, 17% after SRS). At follow-up, 53% of patients had improved, 37% remained the same, 7% had become worse and 3% had died. As a result of post-SRS hemorrhage, a greater proportion of patients was worse or had died after SRS (20%) compared to those who had been treated with microsurgery (5%).",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, psychiatric inpatients and nurses routinely suffer from anxiety. A music intervention may possibly be useful, but knowledge as to how useful and how effective it is in patients with different levels of anxiety is limited. DESIGN: The study design was a three-group, repeated-measures experimental study. METHODS: Subjects were 22 psychiatric patients who were divided into three groups based on their level of anxiety. They listened to 20 minutes of music each day for 10 days and were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory before and after the music intervention and at a one-week follow-up; an electroencephalogram and finger temperature were monitored before and during the music intervention. RESULTS: Anxiety levels of all three groups showed a significant difference (p = 0·0339) after the intervention. The difference alpha and beta electroencephalogram percentages for all three groups showed a significant difference (p = 0·04; p = 0·01). The finger temperature showed a non-significant difference (p = 0·41). CONCLUSIONS: A music intervention can effectively alleviate the anxiety of hospitalised psychiatric patients who suffer from all levels of anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study recommends a practice in alleviating anxiety. Effective lower-cost interventions to reduce anxiety in psychiatric inpatient settings would be of interest to nurses and benefit patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Evidence to date is mixed and impeded by inadequate methodology. This study examined the extent to which fear activation and reduction within and across exposures predicted treatment outcomes for social anxiety disorder within a paradigm suitable for their measurement.	Sixty-eight adults with social anxiety disorder and fear of public speaking completed seven exposure sessions, each consisting of seven speeches conducted in virtual reality. Exposures were identical in duration, task requirements, and virtual public speaking situation. Fear was measured with skin conductance and subjective distress ratings. At baseline and post-treatment, participants completed a public speaking behavioral approach test with a panel of confederate judges; subjective fear was measured. A standardized questionnaire of anxiety symptoms was administered at baseline, post-treatment, and one-month follow-up.	No indices of within- or between-session fear reduction, measured by subjective distress and skin conductance response, predicted treatment outcome. One measure of fear activation was associated with outcomes such that less activation predicted greater symptom reduction; remaining indices did not predict outcomes.	Data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial of scopolamine; drug group was included in analytic models to account for drug influence. VR exposures elicited mild levels of distress that may underestimate levels of distress in clinical settings.	Findings failed to support fear activation or reduction within or across exposure sessions as significant predictors of treatment outcome for social anxiety.

DESIGN: This is a controlled trial evaluating the effects of a motor intervention program on the neuropsychiatric symptoms. SETTING: The intervention was performed on community patients from two university centers specializing in physical exercise for the elderly. SUBJECTS: Patients with Alzheimer's disease were divided into two groups: sixteen received the motor intervention and sixteen controls (five controls were excluded because of clinical intercurrences). INTERVENTIONS: Aerobic exercises (flexibility, strength, and agility) and functional balance exercises were conducted over six months for 60 minutes three times per week. MAIN MEASURES: Psychopathological features of patients were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Caregivers were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Distress and Burden Interview. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to observe interactions (pre- vs. post-intervention; participants vs. controls). RESULTS: Patients from the intervention presented a significant reduction in neuropsychiatric conditions when compared to controls (Neuropsychiatric Inventory: F: 11.12; p = 0.01; Cornell Depression scale: F: 11.97; p = 0.01). The burden and stress of caregivers responsible for patients who participated in the intervention significantly decreased when compared to caregivers responsible for controls (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Distress: F: 9.37; p = 0.01; Burden Interview: F: 11.28; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was associated with a reduction in the neuropsychiatric symptoms and contributed to attenuate the caregivers' burden. However, the researchers were not blinded to the patient's intervention status, which constitutes an important limitation of this study.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
336,32810378,Brain and behavior,Efficacy and safety profile of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage in severe intraventricular hemorrhage patients.,"The present study was conducted to explore the effect of neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation in severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH).	Totally 81 patients with severe IVH in our hospital from November 2017 to March 2019 were divided into the intervention group (38 cases who received neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage) and the control group (40 cases who received trepanation drainage). The perioperative condition, hematoma clearance rate, Glasgow coma score (GCS), hematoma recurrence rate, and prognosis were observed and compared between the two groups after treatment.	The operative time, time of cerebrospinal fluid drainage, and intracranial infection rate in the intervention group elicited superior results to those in the control group (p < .05). The clearance rate of hematoma in the intervention group was higher than that in the control group at 6 hr, 1, 3, and 7 days postoperatively (p < .05). The postoperative 3- and 7-day GCS scores in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group, and the recurrence rate of hematoma in the intervention group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p < .05), and the good/excellent rate of ADL in the intervention group was significantly higher than that in the control group (p < .05).	Neuroendoscopic hematoma evacuation combined with intraventricular lavage showed evident beneficial outcomes in patients with severe IVH. It can effectively improve the perioperative condition and improve the hematoma clearance rate and is beneficial to the prognosis of patients with severe IVH.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
337,30611915,J Affect Disord,Combined sleep deprivation and light therapy: Clinical treatment outcomes in patients with complex unipolar and bipolar depression,"BACKGROUND: The combination of sleep deprivation and light therapy, called combined chronotherapy, may yield positive short- and long-term results, even in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). The implementation of combined chronotherapy in daily clinical practice is rare. This study describes the implementation and the effectiveness in a clinical setting. METHODS: Twenty six depressed patients with unipolar or bipolar depression received combined chronotherapy consisting of three nights of sleep deprivation with alternating recovery nights, light therapy, and continuation of antidepressant medication. Inventory of Depressive Symptoms C (IDS-C) scores were determined before chronotherapy and at week 1, 2, and 4. Paired t-tests were used to compare the IDS-C scores over time. RESULTS: The mean pre-treatment IDS-C score was 39.3 ± 9.6, the mean score in week 2 was 28.4 ± 10.2, and 28.6 ± 14.0 in week 4. A subsample of patients with psychiatric co-morbidities showed a reduction in depression severity from a mean score of 42.9 ± 11.0 to a mean score of 34.9 ± 13.0 after 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 34.6%, the remission rate 19.2%. LIMITATIONS: This open label case series has a relative small sample size and no control group CONCLUSION: In a clinical setting patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder benefited significantly from combined chronotherapy. This chronotherapeutic intervention appears to have a rapid effect that lasts for at least several weeks, even in patients with psychiatric comorbidity or TRD. Indicating that chronotherapy can be a valuable treatment addition for depressed patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
338,30900693,Zhurnal voprosy neirokhirurgii imeni N. N. Burdenko,[Evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in acromegaly using different remission criteria].,"For a long time, surgical removal of somatotropinoma using the transsphenoidal approach has been the first stage of treatment in most acromegaly patients. For the past decades, the efficacy criteria for surgical treatment of acromegaly have significantly changed, which requires appropriate correction.	We aimed to evaluate the results of transsphenoidal adenomectomy in acromegaly patients using various criteria for disease remission.	The study included patients with newly diagnosed acromegaly who underwent transnasal transsphenoidal endoscopic adenomectomy performed by a single neurosurgeon. The surgical treatment outcomes were evaluated 6 months after operative intervention based on levels of IGF-1, OGTT, and GH. The obtained data were analyzed using different threshold values for the level of GH nadir during OGTT: criteria A <2.0 ng/ml, criteria B <1.0 ng/ml, and criteria C <0.4 ng/ml to assess acromegaly remission, along with matching of the IGF-1 level to the reference range for a given gender and age.	The study included 70 patients (52 females and 18 males) with a mean age of 52.2±11.5 years (29 to 73 years). The baseline IGF-1 level exceeded the upper limit of the reference range 3.3±1.4 (1.1-7.3)-fold, on average. The baseline mean basal GH level was 34.2±41.7 (1.2-192.0) ng/ml. The mean pituitary adenoma size was 16.7±8.6 (4.3-46.0) mm; 18 (26%) out of 70 patients had pituitary microadenoma, and 52 (74%) patients had macroadenoma. Six months after surgery, acromegaly remission met criteria A in 47 (67%) patients, criteria B in 28 (40%) patients, and criteria C in 18 (26%) patients.	Our findings demonstrate that evaluation of transsphenoidal adenomectomy outcomes in treatment of acromegaly patients depends on the criteria chosen for assessing remission. This feature should be considered when comparing outcomes of surgical treatment for acromegaly in different years. Probably, introduction of the 2010 criteria should be accompanied by revision of the previous remission indicators.	Уже давно первым этапом лечения пациентов с акромегалией в подавляющем большинстве случаев является хирургическое удаление соматотропиномы транссфеноидальным доступом. В течение последних десятилетий критерии эффективности хирургического лечения акромегалии значительно изменились, что требует сегодня соответствующей коррекции. Цель исследования - оценить результаты транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии у пациентов с акромегалией с использованием различных критериев ремиссии заболевания. Материал и методы. В исследование включили пациентов с впервые выявленной акромегалией, которым была выполнена трансназальная транссфеноидальная эндоскопическая аденомэктомия одним нейрохирургом. Результаты хирургического лечения оценили через 6 мес после оперативного вмешательства путем определения уровня ИФР-1 и ОГТТ с определением ГР. Полученные данные проанализировали, используя различные пороговые значения уровня ГР в ОГТТ: критерии А <2,0 нг/мл, критерии В <1,0 нг/мл, критерии С <0,4 нг/мл для оценки ремиссии акромегалии наряду с соответствием уровня ИФР-1 референсному диапазону для данного пола и возраста. Результаты. В исследование включены 70 пациентов (52 женщины и 18 мужчин), средний возраст которых составил 52,2±11,5 года (от 29 до 73 лет). Исходный уровень ИФР-1 превышал верхнюю границу референсного диапазона в среднем в 3,3±1,4 (1,1-7,3) раза. Исходно средний базальный уровень ГР составил 34,2±41,7 (1,2-192,0) нг/мл. Размер аденомы гипофиза - 16,7±8,6 (4,3-46,0) мм; 18 (26%) из 70 пациентов имели микроаденому гипофиза, 52 (74%) пациента - макроаденому. Через 6 мес после хирургического лечения критериям А ремиссии акромегалии соответствовали 47 (67%) пациентов, критериям В - 28 (40%) пациентов, критериям С - 18 (26%) пациентов. Выводы. Согласно данным нашего исследования, оценка результатов транссфеноидальной аденомэктомии при лечении больных акромегалией зависит от выбранных критериев оценки ремиссии. Эту особенность следует учитывать при сравнительном анализе результатов хирургического лечения акромегалии в разные годы. Очевидно, что с введением критериев 2010 г. прежние показатели ремиссии требуют пересмотра.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
339,20377818,Psychogeriatrics,Effect of aromatherapy on patients with Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVE: Recently, the importance of non-pharmacological therapies for dementia has come to the fore. In the present study, we examined the curative effects of aromatherapy in dementia in 28 elderly people, 17 of whom had Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: After a control period of 28 days, aromatherapy was performed over the following 28 days, with a wash out period of another 28 days. Aromatherapy consisted of the use of rosemary and lemon essential oils in the morning, and lavender and orange in the evening. To determine the effects of aromatherapy, patients were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Gottfries, Brane, Steen scale (GBSS-J), Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (FAST), a revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), and the Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) four times: before the control period, after the control period, after aromatherapy, and after the washout period. RESULTS: All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular, patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores. Result of routine laboratory tests showed no significant changes, suggesting that there were no side-effects associated with the use of aromatherapy. Results from Zarit's score showed no significant changes, suggesting that caregivers had no effect on the improved patient scores seen in the other tests. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found aromatherapy an efficacious non-pharmacological therapy for dementia. Aromatherapy may have some potential for improving cognitive function, especially in AD patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Between 1988 and 2006, 133 subjects underwent modified superficial vestibulectomies. At 4 time intervals, portions of the expanding cohort were queried with a mailed questionnaire. Results were compared to the clinical findings. Questionnaires had closed questions, ranked and non-ranked, as well as open questions and visual analogue scales. Percentages were calculated by SPSS statistical software.	A total of 119 women (89%) returned questionnaires, allowing a mean follow-up interval of 2.8 years; 68% reported that dyspareunia was cured completely, and for 24% it was lessened. Twenty-two percent said they perceived a different pain after surgery, many identifying it as muscular. Eighty-seven percent said they would have the procedure again. Qualitative responses revealed the importance of physical therapy, the complexities of pain issues, the toll on emotions and relationships and suggestions for more education of health practitioners and women generally about this entity.	A large majority of women who underwent superficial vestibule surgery for vestibulodynia found it quite acceptable and instrumental in treating dyspareunia. Many wished they had had it sooner. Individualized, superficial surgery is very effective and should not be withheld if short-term medical and physical therapy have proven to be incomplete therapies.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

The secondary aim of the study was to report preliminary data and in particular potency recovery data.	This was a single-centre, single-arm prospective study, enrolling all patients with localised prostate cancer scheduled for RARP with five-item version of the International Index of Erectile Function scores of >17, from July 2015 to September 2016. All patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. The demographics, perioperative, postoperative and complications data were evaluated. Potency recovery data were evaluated in particular and any sign/symptom of local allergy/intolerance to the ChiMe was recorded and evaluated.	In all, 140 patients underwent NS-RARP with ChiMe applied on the NVBs. Applying the ChiMe was easy in almost all the cases, and did not compromise the safety of the procedure. None of the patients reported signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging.	In our experience, ChiMe applied on the NVBs after NS-RARP was feasible and safe, without compromising the duration, difficulty or complication rate of the 'standard' procedure. No patients had signs of intolerance/allergy attributable to the ChiMe and potency recovery data were encouraging. A comparative cohort would have added value to the study.

344,31403948,J Alzheimers Dis,"A Clinical Trial of Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment in Alzheimer's Disease: Cognitive Enhancement and Associated Changes in Cerebrospinal Fluid, Blood, and Brain Imaging","BACKGROUND: Small aggregates (oligomers) of the toxic proteins amyloid-β (Aβ) and phospho-tau (p-tau) are essential contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In mouse models for AD or human AD brain extracts, Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT) disaggregates both Aβ and p-tau oligomers, and induces brain mitochondrial enhancement. These apparent ""disease-modifying"" actions of TEMT both prevent and reverse memory impairment in AD transgenic mice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and initial clinical efficacy of TEMT against AD, a comprehensive open-label clinical trial was performed. METHODS: Eight mild/moderate AD patients were treated with TEMT in-home by their caregivers for 2 months utilizing a unique head device. TEMT was given for two 1-hour periods each day, with subjects primarily evaluated at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 2 weeks following treatment completion. RESULTS: No deleterious behavioral effects, discomfort, or physiologic changes resulted from 2 months of TEMT, as well as no evidence of tumor or microhemorrhage induction. TEMT induced clinically important and statistically significant improvements in ADAS-cog, as well as in the Rey AVLT. TEMT also produced increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, cognition-related changes in CSF oligomeric Aβ, a decreased CSF p-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio, and reduced levels of oligomeric Aβ in plasma. Pre- versus post-treatment FDG-PET brain scans revealed stable cerebral glucose utilization, with several subjects exhibiting enhanced glucose utilization. Evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy) scans in individual subjects provided support for TEMT-induced increases in functional connectivity within the cognitively-important cingulate cortex/cingulum. CONCLUSION: TEMT administration to AD subjects appears to be safe, while providing cognitive enhancement, changes to CSF/blood AD markers, and evidence of stable/enhanced brain connectivity.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
345,22133242,Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation,Effects of therapeutic gait training using a prosthesis and a treadmill for ambulatory patients with hemiparesis.,"To examine the short-term effects of a newly developed hemiparetic gait training in which patients walk with a prosthesis applied to the nonparetic leg in the flexed knee position.	Pre-post nonrandomized controlled trial.	Rehabilitation center and gait laboratory of a university hospital.	Community-dwelling ambulatory volunteers (N=22) with chronic hemiparesis caused by a unilateral stroke.	Study subjects participated in a gait training program using either a below-knee prosthesis or a treadmill. Treadmill gait training was performed at a speed approximating the maximum gait velocity for each patient. The 3-week program consisted of a 5-minute gait training session 2 to 3 times a day.	The ground reaction forces, stance time, step length and cadence during walking at a comfortable speed, and maximum gait speed, as well as the Berg Balance Score, were estimated before and after each training program.	In comparison with changes after the treadmill gait training, analyses of covariance demonstrated a significant increase of the fore-aft ground reaction forces during the paretic propulsion phase and a significant increase in the relative durations of the paretic and nonparetic single stance involved in a gait cycle after the prosthetic gait training (P<.05).	Prosthetic gait training would have different effects on a hemiparetic gait than treadmill gait training. The gait-related task inducing the dominant use of the paretic leg to support the body may be useful as a rehabilitative treatment to improve the kinetic abilities in the paretic stance period.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0
346,33221715,J Affect Disord,Efficacy and neurophysiological predictors of treatment response of adjunct bifrontal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in treating unipolar and bipolar depression,"BACKGROUND: Although add-on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising intervention for treating unipolar (UD) and bipolar depression (BD), its moderate antidepressant efficacy urges research into biomarkers for predicting therapeutic response and achieving highly targeted applications. METHODS: This open-label trial enrolled UD (N=58) and BD (N=22) patients who had failed 1 or more trials of adequate pharmacologic interventions (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03287037). Bifrontal tDCS (anode/cathode: F3/F4) was applied using a 2 mA current for 20 min, twice daily, for 5 consecutive weekdays. Depression was measured with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD) at baseline, after 10-session stimulation, 1- and 4-week follow-ups. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured at baseline, during the initial 5 min of the 1(st) session, after 10-session stimulation, 1- and 4-week follow-ups. Cognitive performance and other outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Bifrontal tDCS rapidly and equally improved depression in both groups. The effects persisted until the end of the trial. Both groups had similar improvements in cognitive performance, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Compared with baseline, increased vagally-mediated HRV was observed one month after tDCS for both groups. A positive correlation was found between HR deceleration within the 1(st) session and treatment response after 10-session tDCS only among UD patients, explaining 20% of the variance. CONCLUSION: tDCS as an adjunct therapy is effective for both UD and BD. Data suggest that the greater the increase in parasympathetic signaling during the 1(st) session, the better the clinical response after 10-session tDCS for UD patients.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

Five males with tetraplegia (TP) and four males with paraplegia (PR) exercised 1) sitting, 2) supine, and 3) sitting with the addition of a) an anti-gravity suit (anti-G), b) elastic stockings and abdominal binder, and c) functional electrical stimulation of the leg muscles. Compared to sitting, the following significant changes were observed: in the supine position, heart rate (HR) decreased (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 76 vs 92 b/min) and stroke volume (SV) increased (PR: 132 vs 116 ml, TP: 96 vs 83 ml). The anti-G suit induced a decrease in heart rate (PR: 104 vs 118 b/min, TP: 87 vs 92 b/min) and a decrease in oxygen uptake (VO2) in PR. Stockings only affected TP, i.e. a decrease in heart rate with 5 b/min and an increase in stroke volume with 13 ml/beat. Functional electrical stimulation produced an increase in VO2 (PR: 1.00 vs 0.95 l/min, TP: 0.68 vs 0.53 l/min) and a rise in stroke volume in TP. Results indicate that the methods employed to support the circulatory redistribution have different working mechanisms and, in addition, that the effects are different for TP and PR probably because of differences in active muscle mass, sympathetic impairment and blood pressure values.",Human-non-RCT-non-drug-intervention,2,0

349,27520275,Molecular neurobiology,Intranasal Delivery of a Caspase-1 Inhibitor in the Treatment of Global Cerebral Ischemia.,"Caspase-1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation, a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration. However, it is unknown whether a caspase-1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia (GCI) and whether intranasal administration of a caspase-1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following GCI. The present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of post-ischemic intranasal administration of the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK in a 4-vessel occlusion model of GCI in the rat. Herein, we show that intranasal Boc-D-CMK readily penetrated the central nervous system, subsequently inhibiting caspase-1 activity, decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction, and attenuating caspase-3-dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemia-vulnerable hippocampal CA1 region. Further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying Boc-D-CMK's neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis, as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Intranasal Boc-D-CMK post-treatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of NeuN-positive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of TUNEL-positive and PARP1-positive cells in hippocampal CA1. Correspondingly, behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance, and long-term recognition memory following GCI were significantly improved in the Boc-D-CMK post-treated animals. In summary, the current study demonstrates that the caspase-1 inhibitor Boc-D-CMK coordinates anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal CA1 region following GCI. Furthermore, our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase-1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient GCI.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
350,20598917,Seizure,Baccoside A suppresses epileptic-like seizure/convulsion in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"The 1 mm long Caenorhabditis elegans is one of the prime research tools to study different human neurodegenerative diseases. We have considered the case in which increase in the surrounding temperature of this multicellular model leads to abnormal bursts of neuronal cells that can be linked to seizure or convulsion. The induction of such seizure/convulsion mechanism was done by gradually increasing the temperature with 1x buffer (100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl(2)) in adult C. elegans. In the present experiment it is demonstrated that Baccoside A can significantly reduce the seizure/convulsion in C. elegans at higher temperatures (26-28+/-1 degrees C). Furthermore, in T-type Ca(2+) channel cca-1 mutant worms, no convulsion was recorded. Our experimental results suggest that plant molecules from Bacopa monnieri may be useful in suppressing the seizure/convulsion in worms.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
351,34207317,Biomolecules,Pharmacokinetics and Molecular Modeling Indicate nAChRα4-Derived Peptide HAEE Goes through the Blood-Brain Barrier.,"One of the treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the use of pharmacological agents capable of binding to beta-amyloid (Aβ) and blocking its aggregation in the brain. Previously, we found that intravenous administration of the synthetic tetrapeptide Acetyl-His-Ala-Glu-Glu-Amide (HAEE), which is an analogue of the 35-38 region of the α4 subunit of α4β2 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and specifically binds to the 11-14 site of Aβ, reduced the development of cerebral amyloidogenesis in a mouse model of AD. In the current study on three types of laboratory animals, we determined the biodistribution and tissue localization patterns of HAEE peptide after single intravenous bolus administration. The pharmacokinetic parameters of HAEE were established using uniformly tritium-labeled HAEE. Pharmacokinetic data provided evidence that HAEE goes through the blood-brain barrier. Based on molecular modeling, a role of LRP1 in receptor-mediated transcytosis of HAEE was proposed. Altogether, the results obtained indicate that the anti-amyloid effect of HAEE, previously found in a mouse model of AD, most likely occurs due to its interaction with Aβ species directly in the brain.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
352,21801595,Neurological research,Differential effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury.,"Previously we have reported that endothelin receptor A and B antagonists elicit differential effects on cerebral blood flow and cellular damage. In summary, endothelin receptor A antagonists restore microcirculation and diminish cellular damage after injury, while endothelin receptor B antagonists had no effect on either parameter. However, what is not known is the effect of either antagonist on behavioral outcome. Therefore, this work was designed to test the effects of endothelin receptor A and B antagonism on behavioral outcome following traumatic brain injury (TBI).	A total of 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats (400-450 g) were used in this study. Four groups (n = 12 per group) were generated as follows: sham operation, trauma+vehicle (0·9% saline), trauma+40 nmol BQ-123 (a selective endothelin receptor A antagonist) and trauma +20 nmol BQ-788 (a selective endothelin receptor B antagonist). All treatments were delivered via intracerebroventricular injection. Trauma was induced using a weight acceleration impact device. Twenty-four hours post-injection animals were tested for 21 days on a radial arm maze task to determine cognitive outcome.	Our data indicated that endothelin receptor A antagonism significantly reduced the extent of behavioral deficits following TBI while endothelin receptor B and vehicle injection had no effect.	The results suggest that endothelin receptor A, but not endothelin receptor B, antagonism improves behavioral outcome following TBI. Furthermore, these data provide a functional correlate to previously published findings in our laboratory showing that endothelin receptor A antagonism improves both blood flow and cellular outcome following TBI. In a broader sense, this work demonstrates that hypoperfusion following TBI likely contributes to poor outcome following head injury.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
353,31207861,Psychiatry research,Early antipsychotic exposure affects NMDA and GABAA receptor binding in the brains of juvenile rats.,"Antipsychotics were developed to treat schizophrenia in adults; however they have been increasingly prescribed in children and adolescents. The NMDA and GABAA receptors are involved in neurodevelopment and the pathophysiology of various mental disorders in children and adolescents. Male and female juvenile rats were treated orally with risperidone (0.3 mg/kg, 3 times/day), aripiprazole (1 mg/kg), olanzapine (1 mg/kg) or vehicle (control), starting from postnatal day (PD) 23 (±1 day) for 3 weeks (corresponding to the childhood-adolescent period in humans). Quantitative autoradiography was used to detect the binding density of [[3]H]MK-801 (an NMDA receptor antagonist) and [[3]H]muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist). Aripiprazole elevated the [[3]H]MK801 binding levels in the NAcC of male rats, and the NAcS and CPu of female rats. Risperidone increased [[3]H]MK801 levels in the CPu of female rats, and the NAcS of male rats. Aripiprazole upregulated [[3]H]muscimol binding levels in the CPu and NAcC of male rats, while it elevated the [[3]H]muscimol levels in the PFC of female rats, compared to controls. These results suggest that early treatment with these antipsychotics modulates NMDA and GABAA neurotransmission in juveniles, which may play a role in their clinical efficacy in the control of mental disorders in children and adolescents.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
354,29439368,Restor Neurol Neurosci,Systemic administration of donepezil attenuates the efficacy of environmental enrichment on neurobehavioral outcome after experimental traumatic brain injury,"BACKGROUND: The acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) donepezil (DON) is recommended as a potential treatment for cognition after clinical traumatic brain injury (TBI) and therefore may be prescribed as an adjunct therapy during rehabilitation. However, a dose-response study evaluating DON after a controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in rats did not reveal cognitive benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of DON on behavioral and histological outcome when combined with environmental enrichment (EE), a preclinical model of neurorehabilitation. It was hypothesized that the combined treatments would produce a synergistic effect yielding improved recovery over neurorehabilitation alone. METHODS: Isoflurane-anesthetized adult male rats received a CCI or sham injury and then were randomly assigned to EE or standard (STD) housing plus systemic injections of DON (0.25 mg/kg) or vehicle (VEH; 1.0 mL/kg saline) once daily for 19 days beginning 24 hr after injury. Function was assessed by established motor and cognitive tests on post-injury days 1-5 and 14-19, respectively. Cortical lesion volume was quantified on day 19. RESULTS: DON was ineffective when administered alone. In contrast, EE conferred significant motor and cognitive benefits, and reduced cortical lesion volume vs. STD (p < 0.05). Combining the therapies weakened the efficacy of rehabilitation as revealed by diminished motor and cognitive recovery in the TBI+EE+DON group vs. the TBI+EE+VEH group (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: These data replicate previous findings showing that EE is beneficial and DON is ineffective after CCI and add to the literature a novel and unpredicted finding that supports neither the hypothesis nor the use of DON for TBI. Investigation of other AChEIs after CCI injury is necessary to gain further insight into the value of this therapeutic strategy.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The effect of the triglyceride form of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (TG-DHA) was assayed in vitro and in vivo to assess the protective and anti-inflammatory activity of this compound. In the in vitro study, BV-2 microglia cells were previously treated with TG-DHA and then activated with Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ). TG-DHA treatment protected BV-2 microglia cells from oxidative stress toxicity attenuating NO production and suppressing the induction of inflammatory cytokines. When compared with DHA in the ethyl-ester form, a significant difference in the ability to inhibit NO production in favor of TG-DHA was observed. TG-DHA inhibited significantly splenocyte proliferation but isolated CD4+ lymphocyte proliferation was unaffected. In a mice model of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), 250 mg/kg/day oral TG-DHA treatment was associated with a significant amelioration of the course and severity of the disease as compared to untreated animals. TG-DHA-treated EAE mice showed a better weight profile, which is a symptom related to a better course of encephalomyelitis. TG-DHA may be a promising therapeutic agent in neuroinflammatory processes and merit to be more extensively studied in human neurodegenerative disorders.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
356,19250803,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,Baclofen prevents drug-induced reinstatement of extinguished nicotine-seeking behaviour and nicotine place preference in rodents,"The gamma-aminobutyric acid(GABA)-B receptor agonist baclofen is known to reduce drug intake in both animals and humans and to prevent reinstatement of cocaine-, opioid-, and alcohol-seeking in rats after a period of extinction, but its effect on nicotine reinstatement is unknown. This study investigated the effect of baclofen on nicotine-seeking reinstatement both using the extinction/reinstatement model of nicotine self-administration and conditioned place preference (CPP). Results showed that in rats previously trained to intravenously self-administer nicotine (30 microg/kg/inf) under a FR-1 schedule of reinforcement, acute nicotine (0.15 mg/kg) priming effectively reinstates nicotine-seeking behaviour following extinction. At doses used in this study (up to 2.5 mg/kg) baclofen alone did not affect locomotor activity and did not reinstate responding. However, baclofen dose-dependently attenuated drug-induced reinstatement of nicotine-seeking in rats. Moreover, baclofen (1.25 mg/kg) completely blocked nicotine-induced reinstatement of extinguished nicotine (0.3 mg/kg) CPP in mice. Altogether, our results showed that baclofen is able to antagonise reinstatement of nicotine-seeking and CPP triggered by nicotine primings, suggesting its potential clinical utility as an anti-relapse agent.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
357,28481536,Journal of medicinal chemistry,Discovery of a Small Molecule Probe That Post-Translationally Stabilizes the Survival Motor Neuron Protein for the Treatment of Spinal Muscular Atrophy.,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the leading genetic cause of infant death. We previously developed a high-throughput assay that employs an SMN2-luciferase reporter allowing identification of compounds that act transcriptionally, enhance exon recognition, or stabilize the SMN protein. We describe optimization and characterization of an analog suitable for in vivo testing. Initially, we identified analog 4m that had good in vitro properties but low plasma and brain exposure in a mouse PK experiment due to short plasma stability; this was overcome by reversing the amide bond and changing the heterocycle. Thiazole 27 showed excellent in vitro properties and a promising mouse PK profile, making it suitable for in vivo testing. This series post-translationally stabilizes the SMN protein, unrelated to global proteasome or autophagy inhibition, revealing a novel therapeutic mechanism that should complement other modalities for treatment of SMA.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
358,18346734,Experimental neurology,AAV2-mediated gene transfer of GDNF to the striatum of MPTP monkeys enhances the survival and outgrowth of co-implanted fetal dopamine neurons.,"Neural transplantation offers the potential of treating Parkinson's disease by grafting fetal dopamine neurons to depleted regions of the brain. However, clinical studies of neural grafting in Parkinson's disease have produced only modest improvements. One of the main reasons for this is the low survival rate of transplanted neurons. The inadequate supply of critical neurotrophic factors in the adult brain is likely to be a major cause of early cell death and restricted outgrowth of fetal grafts placed into the mature striatum. Glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent neurotrophic factor that is crucial to the survival, outgrowth and maintenance of dopamine neurons, and so is a candidate for protecting grafted fetal dopamine neurons in the adult brain. We found that implantation of adeno-associated virus type 2 encoding GDNF (AAV2-GDNF) in the normal monkey caudate nucleus induced overexpression of GDNF that persisted for at least 6 months after injection. In a 6-month within-animal controlled study, AAV2-GDNF enhanced the survival of fetal dopamine neurons by 4-fold, and increased the outgrowth of grafted fetal dopamine neurons by almost 3-fold in the caudate nucleus of MPTP-treated monkeys, compared with control grafts in the other caudate nucleus. Thus, the addition of GDNF gene therapy to neural transplantation may be a useful strategy to improve treatment for Parkinson's disease.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
359,9255596,Epilepsy research,AWD 140-190: a new anticonvulsant with a very good margin of safety.,"The anticonvulsant activity of the novel drug AWD 140-190 (4-(p-bromophenyl)-3-morpholino-1H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid methyl ester) was evaluated in animal models of epileptic seizures. AWD 140-190 was active at nontoxic doses after oral and intraperitoneal administration in rats and mice in a range of anticonvulsant tests. The compound was active against electrically-induced seizures (MES, ED50 rat p.o. = 2.47 mg/kg), in a genetic animal model the DBA/2 mouse, and in corneally kindled rats. It was not active against seizures induced chemically by pentylenetetrazole, bicuculline and strychnine. Effective doses in mice following both oral and intraperitoneal administration are similar indicating good oral absorption. During 14 days chronic oral treatment of mice with 10 mg/kg, no development of tolerance was observed. The protective indices (TD50/MES ED50) in rats and mice following oral administration are favorable when compared to phenytoin, carbamazepine and valproate. No motor impairment, evaluated with the rotarod test and by observation in the open field test, was observable following oral administration of doses up to 500 mg/kg. There was no influence on spontaneous motility and learning performance in rats and no interaction with ethanol in mice after administration of doses which are above anticonvulsant effective doses indicating the absence of central side effects. AWD 140-190 thus presents an orally active and safe anticonvulsant agent, which is structurally unrelated to anticonvulsants currently used.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
360,2908897,J Neuropathol Exp Neurol,Morphologic alterations in rat brain following systemic and intraventricular methotrexate injection: light and electron microscopic studies,"To determine the morphological substrate of acute methotrexate (MTX) encephalopathy, light and electron microscopic studies were performed on rat brains after short-term intraperitoneal (IP) and intraventricular (IV) injections of MTX. In both models, Alzheimer type II astrocytosis was the initial and major pathologic alteration seen by light microscopy. The neurons, oligodendrocytes, myelin and endothelial cells were relatively spared. Ultrastructural studies showed pleomorphism and condensation of mitochondria, membrane-bound vacuoles, prominent stacks of sparsely granular, rough endoplasmic reticulum and progressive hydropic swelling of astrocytic perikarya and their processes. The astroglial alterations were reversible after cessation of the drug but persisted for a longer time with repeated IP administration. Gastrointestinal complications and overall mortality were also greater with higher doses and increasing frequency of IP MTX injection. White matter necrosis was noted only after IV injection of high-dose MTX. The neuropathologic changes of MTX leukoencephalopathy can be replicated in an animal model by IV injection of the drug. The reversibility of the changes that were seen following IP administration correlates with the transient neurologic deficits observed in some patients after high-dose systemic MTX therapy. The initially selective astroglial effect suggests that astrocytes might be a target for MTX toxicity, although other central nervous system components may also be adversely affected by the drug.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
361,2755582,Neurosurgery,The efficacy of intravenous nimodipine in the treatment of focal cerebral ischemia in a primate model,"The clinical and pathological effects of nimodipine on cerebral infarction were investigated in 12 male baboons. In randomized/blind trials, six animals given intravenous nimodipine (2 micrograms/kg/min load, 1 microgram/kg/min maintenance) for 96 hours starting 50 minutes before 6-hour double-clip occlusion of the middle cerebral artery were compared to 6 control animals. Standardized neurological examinations were performed by examiners blinded to the animals' therapy on Day 7 and Day 14 after stroke. On Day 14 the animals were killed. The brains were studied pathologically, and the relative areas of infarction were quantified. Intracranial pressure was lower in nimodipine-treated animals; however, the range of intracranial pressure values in each group was broad. Two control animals with high intracranial pressure died. There were no deaths among the nimodipine-treated animals. The neurological scores on Days 7 (P less than or equal to 0.01) and 14 (P less than or equal to 0.05) were significantly different between the two groups. The nimodipine-treated animals had less clinical evidence of infarction compared to controls. Nimodipine-treated animals tended to have smaller areas of infarction; however, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant. The infusion of nimodipine in the treatment of focal cerebral ischemia is safe and does not appear to aggravate the extent of infarction or to exacerbate intracranial hypertension. The clinical neurological evaluations indicate that nimodipine may improve or preserve neurological outcome after stroke.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
362,35446941,Brain : a journal of neurology,Clearance of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prions in vivo by the Hsp70 disaggregase system.,"The metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase protects neurons from proteotoxicity that arises from the accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates. Hsp70 and its co-chaperones disassemble and extract polypeptides from protein aggregates for refolding or degradation. The effectiveness of the chaperone system decreases with age and leads to accumulation rather than removal of neurotoxic protein aggregates. Therapeutic enhancement of the Hsp70 protein disassembly machinery is proposed to counter late-onset protein misfolding neurodegenerative disease that may arise. In the context of prion disease, it is not known whether stimulation of protein aggregate disassembly paradoxically leads to enhanced formation of seeding competent species of disease-specific proteins and acceleration of neurodegenerative disease. Here we have tested the hypothesis that modulation of Hsp70 disaggregase activity perturbs mammalian prion-induced neurotoxicity and prion seeding activity. To do so we used prion protein (PrP) transgenic Drosophila that authentically replicate mammalian prions. RNASeq identified that Hsp70, DnaJ-1 and Hsp110 gene expression was downregulated in prion-exposed PrP Drosophila. We demonstrated that RNAi knockdown of Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila enhanced neurotoxicity, whereas overexpression mitigated toxicity. Strikingly, prion seeding activity in variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease prion-exposed human PrP Drosophila was ablated or reduced by Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 overexpression, respectively. Similar effects were seen in scrapie prion-exposed ovine PrP Drosophila with modified Hsp110 or DnaJ-1 gene expression. These unique observations show that the metazoan Hsp70 disaggregase facilitates the clearance of mammalian prions and that its enhanced activity is a potential therapeutic strategy for human prion disease.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

The Folts model was used in 60 rabbits. After anesthesia, the carotid artery was exposed and a 75% stenosis was induced. A compression injury of the artery triggered a series of cyclic flow reductions (CFRs). After counting baseline CFRs, animals were assigned randomly to one of four groups (n = 15 in each): control, PRP, rFVIIa and placebo. Control animals received 10 mL.kg(-1) of saline while 10 mL.kg(-1) of a hydroxyethyl starch solution (200,000/6%/0.5) were infused in the three other groups. CFRs were measured again, followed by treatment with PRP, rFVIIa or placebo and by a final measurement of CFRs. At the end of each observation period, an ear immersion bleeding time (BT) was measured and a blood sample was drawn for the evaluation of hematological variables. Microvascular bleeding was evaluated at the end of the experiment in grams of blood shed from liver and spleen sections. Results are presented as median (range).	rFVIIa shortened the BT and decreased microvascular bleeding as compared with placebo [60 (35-100) sec vs 110 (50-140) sec, P = 0.0019 and 9 (4-24) g vs 17 (5-28) g, P = 0.002, respectively]. rFVIIa did not increase CFRs [3(0-9) vs |(0-5), P = 0.11].	rFVIIa led to a decrease in BT and microvascular bleeding but did not significantly affect arterial thrombosis in rabbits.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
364,26085639,J Neurosci,Omega-3 Fatty Acids Augment the Actions of Nuclear Receptor Agonists in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer's Disease,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a highly prevalent disorder for which there are no effective therapies. Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides in the brain is associated with impaired cognition and memory, pronounced inflammatory dysregulation, and subsequent amyloid plaque deposition. Thus, drugs that promote the clearance of Aβ peptides and resolution of inflammation may represent viable therapeutic approaches. Agonists of nuclear receptors LXR:RXR and PPAR:RXR act to ameliorate AD-related cognitive impairment and amyloid accumulation in murine models of AD. The use of an agonist to the nuclear receptor RXR, bexarotene, as monotherapy against AD, presents potential challenges due to the metabolic perturbations it induces in the periphery, most prominently hypertriglyceridemia. We report that the ω-3 fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in combination with bexarotene, enhances LXR:RXR target gene expression of Abca1 and ApoE, reduces soluble forms of Aβ, and abrogates release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators both in vitro and in a mouse model of AD. Moreover, DHA abrogates bexarotene-induced hypertriglyceridemia in vivo. Importantly, dual therapy promotes reductions in AD pathology and resultant amelioration of cognitive deficits. While monotherapy with either bexarotene or DHA resulted in modest effects in vitro and in vivo, combined treatment with both agents produced a significant additive benefit on associated AD-related phenotypes, suggesting that targeted combinatorial agents may be beneficial over single agents alone in treating AD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
365,15956992,Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology,Constitutively active micro opioid receptors mediate the enhanced conditioned aversive effect of naloxone in morphine-dependent mice.,"Naloxone administration produces a robust conditioned place aversion (CPA) in opiate-naive rodents by blocking the action of enkephalins at mu opioid receptors. This aversive response is potentiated by prior exposure to morphine. In vitro studies indicate that morphine treatment may promote constitutive activity of mu opioid receptors. We hypothesized that such enhanced constitutive activity in vivo may underlie the increased aversive property of naloxone by uncovering the inverse agonist property of this drug. The CPA produced by naloxone was compared with that produced by the neutral antagonists 6-alpha- and 6-beta-naloxol in mice with and without prior morphine exposure. While all three drugs produced CPA, only naloxone CPA was enhanced by morphine given 20 h prior to each naloxone injection. Furthermore, only naloxone produced withdrawal jumping when given 20 h after morphine, even though 6-alpha-naloxol was able to produce jumping when given 4 h after morphine. These data suggest that morphine may enhance naloxone CPA by increasing levels of constitutively active mu receptors and further support the role of such constitutive activity in mediating naloxone-precipitated physical withdrawal. Such long-term changes in constitutive activity of the mu receptor induced by exogenous opiate exposure may thus be an important factor in hedonic homeostatic dysregulation proposed to underlie the addictive process.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Recent studies have demonstrated that several antagonists of NMDA receptors have important cardiovascular effects. In this study, we examined whether the cardiovascular effects of ACPC involve the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and its antioxidant effect in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). Male SHRSP were divided into two groups: a control group and an ACPC group administered ACPC at 50 mg/kg per day for 4 weeks by peritoneal injection. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) and mortality of stroke were significantly lower in the ACPC group than in the control group. Urinary Na(+) and Cl(-) excretion and plasma superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity were increased in the ACPC group. Western analysis detected proteins that were immunoreactive to anti-nitrotyrosine antibody and showed lower levels of expression in the cerebral cortex compared to that in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) formation in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was reduced in the ACPC group. Quantitative reverse-transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that administration of ACPC also significantly decreased the expression of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) mRNA in the hippocampus and endotherial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA in the cerebral cortex, and drastically increased HO-1 mRNA in the cerebral cortex. Enhanced HO-1 staining on sections from the hippocampus and cerebral cortex was observed in the ACPC group. These data suggest that the normalization by ACPC of blood pressure elevation and mortality of stroke involves induction of the expression of HO-1, which exerts antioxidant and vascular relaxation effects, in SHRSP.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
367,31524960,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,Assessment of Acute Motor Effects and Tolerance Following Self-Administration of Alcohol and Edible ∆(9) -Tetrahydrocannabinol in Adolescent Male Mice,"BACKGROUND: Cannabinoids and their principle psychoactive target, the cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R), impact a number of alcohol-related properties, and although alcohol and cannabis are often co-used, particularly in adolescence, few animal models of this phenomenon exist. We modeled the co-use of alcohol and ∆(9) -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in adolescent mice using ingestive methods popular during this developmental period in humans, namely binge-drinking and edible THC. With this model, we assessed levels of use, acute effects, and tolerance to each substance. METHODS: Adolescent male C57BL/6J mice had daily, limited access to 1 of 2 edible doughs (THC or control), to 1 of 2 fluids (ethanol (EtOH) or water), and in 1 of 2 orders (dough-fluid or fluid-dough). Home cage locomotor activity was recorded both during access and after access. On the day following the final access session, a subset of mice were assessed for functional and metabolic tolerance to alcohol using accelerating rotarod and blood EtOH concentrations, respectively. The remaining mice were assessed for tolerance to THC-induced hypothermia, and whole-brain CB1R expression was assessed in all mice. RESULTS: EtOH intake was on par with levels previously reported in adolescent mice. Edible THC was well-consumed, but consumption decreased at the highest dose provided. Locomotor activity increased following EtOH intake and decreased following edible THC consumption, and edible THC increased fluid intake in general. The use of alcohol produced neither functional nor metabolic tolerance to an alcohol challenge. However, the use of edible THC impaired subsequent drug-free rotarod performance and was associated with a reduction in THC's hypothermic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescent mice self-administered both alcohol and edible THC to a degree sufficient to acutely impact locomotor activity. However, only edible THC consumption had lasting effects during short-term abstinence. Thus, this adolescent co-use model could be used to explore sex differences in self-administration and the impact substance co-use might have on other domains such as mood and cognition.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
368,20648652,J Neurosci Res,Potential in vivo amelioration by N-acetyl-L-cysteine of oxidative stress in brain in human double mutant APP/PS-1 knock-in mice: toward therapeutic modulation of mild cognitive impairment,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent form of dementia among the elderly. Although the underlying cause has yet to be established, numerous data have shown that oxidative stress is implicated in AD as well as in preclinical stages of AD, such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The oxidative stress observed in brains of subjects with AD and MCI may be due, either fully or in part, to increased free radicals mediated by amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta). By using double human mutant APP/PS-1 knock-in mice as the AD model, the present work demonstrates that the APP/PS-1 double mutation results in elevated protein oxidation (as indexed by protein carbonyls), protein nitration (as indexed by 3-nitrotyrosine), as well as lipid peroxidation (as indexed by protein-bound 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) in brains of mice aged 9 months and 12 months. APP/PS-1 mice also exhibited lower levels of brain glutathione peroxidase (GPx) in both age groups studied, whereas glutathione reductase (GR) levels in brain were unaffected by the mutation. The activities of both of these antioxidant enzymes were significantly decreased in APP/PS-1 mouse brains, whereas the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) was increased relative to controls in both age groups. Levels of peptidyl prolyl isomerase 1 (Pin1) were significantly decreased in APP/PS-1 mouse brain aged 9 and 12 months. Administration of N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), a glutathione precursor, to APP/PS-1 mice via drinking water suppressed increased protein oxidation and nitration and also significantly augmented levels and activity of GPx in brain from both age groups. Oral administration of NAC also increased the diminished activity of GR and protected against lipid peroxidation in brains of 9-month-old APP/PS-1 mice only. Pin1 levels, GR levels, and G6PDH activity in brain were unaffected by oral administration of NAC in both age groups. These results are discussed with reference to the therapeutic potential of this brain-accessible glutathione precursor in the treatment of MCI and AD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
369,19397425,Journal of neurotrauma,Dose and chemical modification considerations for continuous cyclic AMP analog delivery to the injured CNS.,"In this investigation, two cell-permeable synthetic analogs of cAMP, dibutyryl-cAMP (db-cAMP) and 8-bromo-cAMP, which are widely used to elevate intracellular cAMP levels under experimental conditions, were investigated for their ability to dose-dependently improve histological and functional outcomes following continuous delivery in two models of incomplete spinal cord injury (SCI). The cAMP analogs were delivered via osmotic minipumps at 1-250 mM through an indwelling cortical cannula or by intrathecal infusion for up to 4 weeks after either a T8 unilateral over-hemisection or a C2-3 dorsolateral quadrant lesion, respectively. In both SCI models, continuous db-cAMP delivery was associated with histopathological changes that included sporadic micro-hemorrhage formation and cavitation, enhanced macrophage infiltration and tissue damage at regions beyond the immediate application site; no deleterious or beneficial effect of agent delivery was observed at the spinal injury site. Furthermore, these changes were accompanied by pronounced behavioral deficits that included an absence of progressive locomotor recovery, increased extensor tone, paralysis, and sensory abnormalities. These deleterious effects were not observed in saline-treated animals, in animals in which the db-cAMP dose did not exceed 1 mM, or in those animals that received a high dose (250 mM) of the alternative cAMP analog, 8-bromo-cAMP. These results demonstrate that, for continuous intraparenchymal or intrathecal administration of cAMP analogs for the study of biological or therapeutic effects within the central nervous system (CNS), consideration of the effective concentration applied as well as the potential toxicity of chemical moieties on the parent molecule and/or their activity needs to be taken into account.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

This study used the Morris water maze task to investigate the effect of high doses of the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone on spatial learning and memory in male rats. During the experiment, we observed a significantly impaired Morris water maze performance in the nandrolone-treated rats compared with controls. The hippocampus, a brain region associated with cognitive function, was analyzed for mRNA expression of prodynorphin, the precursor of dynorphinergic peptides. The results indicated that the transcription levels of prodynorphin were significantly elevated in the animals treated with nandrolone compared with controls. Thus, the findings suggest that administration of nandrolone to male rats impairs memory function, possibly via dynorphinergic actions.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

OBJECTIVE: This research investigated if paclitaxel (PTX) delivered via the intranasal (IN) route could alter the phenotypic progression of AD in 3xTg-AD mice. METHODS: We administered intranasal PTX in 3XTg-AD mice (3xTg-AD n = 15, 10 weeks and n = 10, 44 weeks, PTX: 0.6 mg/kg or 0.9%saline (SAL)) at 2-week intervals. After treatment, 3XTg-AD mice underwent manganese-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging to measure in vivo axonal transport. In a separate 3XTg-AD cohort, PTX-treated mice were tested in a radial water tread maze at 52 weeks of age after four treatments, and at 72 weeks of age, anxiety was assessed by an elevated-plus maze after 14 total treatments. RESULTS: PTX increased axonal transport rates in treated 3XTg-AD compared to controls (p≤0.003). Further investigation using an in vitro neuron model of Aβ-induced axonal transport disruption confirmed PTX prevented axonal transport deficits. Confocal microscopy after treatment found fewer phospho-tau containing neurons (5.25±3.8 versus 8.33±2.5, p < 0.04) in the CA1, altered microglia, and reduced reactive astrocytes. PTX improved performance of 3xTg-AD on the water tread maze compared to controls and not significantly different from WT (Day 5, 143.8±43 versus 91.5±77s and Day 12, 138.3±52 versus 107.7±75s for SAL versus PTX). Elevated plus maze revealed that PTX-treated 3xTg-AD mice spent more time exploring open arms (Open arm 129.1±80 versus 20.9±31s for PTX versus SAL, p≤0.05). CONCLUSION: Taken collectively, these findings indicate that intranasal-administered microtubule-stabilizing drugs may offer a potential therapeutic option for treating AD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In addition to β-amyloid aggregation and hyperphosphorylated tau, neuroinflammation also plays important roles in the pathophysiology of this multifactorial disorder. Histone deacetylase catalyzes deacetylation of histones and has important roles in the regulation of gene expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors have been reported to exhibit neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory activities and have therapeutic effects in several animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Here, an efficient benzamide histone deacetylase inhibitor, MS-275, was orally administered by gavage to transgenic APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of cerebral amyloidosis for Alzheimer disease. After 10 days of treatment, MS-275 significantly ameliorated microglial activation and β-amyloid deposition in cerebral cortex and/or hippocampus. This was associated with improved nesting behavior, an important affiliative/social behavior. MS-275 also attenuated inflammatory activation of a mouse macrophage cell line in vitro. These results suggest that MS-275 may be a therapeutic option for Alzheimer disease and other neuroinflammatory diseases.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether chronic unpredicted stress (CUS) mediated neurological alterations are associated with impaired hippocampal insulin signaling or not, and studied the effect of quercetin in this scenario. Male Swiss albino mice were subjected to 21day CUS, during which 30mg/kg quercetin treatment was given orally. After 21days, behavioral functions were evaluated in terms of locomotor activity (Actophotometer), muscle coordination (Rota-rod), depression (Tail Suspension Test (TST), Forced Swim Test (FST)) and memory performance (Passive-avoidance step-down task (PASD)). Further, hippocampal insulin signaling was evaluated in terms of protein expression of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT-4) and neurogenesis was evaluated in terms of doublecortin (DCX) expression. 21day CUS significantly impaired locomotion and had no effect on muscle coordination. Stressed animals were depressed and showed markedly impaired memory functions. Quercetin treatment significantly improvement stress-mediated behavior dysfunction as indicated by improved locomotion, lesser immobility time and greater frequency of upward turning in TST and FST and increased transfer latency on the day 2 (short-term memory) and day 5 (long-term memory) in PASD test. We observed significantly higher IR expression and significantly lower GLUT-4 expression in the hippocampus of stressed animals, despite of nonsignificant difference in insulin levels. Further, chronic stress impaired hippocampal neurogenesis, as indicated by the significantly reduced levels of hippocampal DCX expression. Quercetin treatment significantly lowered insulin and IR expression and significantly enhanced GLUT-4 and DCX expression in the hippocampus, when compared to CUS. In conclusion, quercetin treatment efficiently alleviated stress mediated behavioral dysfunction by modulating hippocampal insulin signaling and neurogenesis.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Here, we test our hypothesis that selective inhibitors of neuronal calcium channels will reduce ethanol consumption and intoxication, based on our previous studies using knock-out mice and cell culture systems. We demonstrate that pretreatment with the novel mixed N-type and T-type calcium channel antagonist 1-(6,6-bis(4-fluorophenyl)hexyl)-4-(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzyl)piperazine (NP078585) reduced ethanol intoxication. NP078585 also attenuated the reinforcing and rewarding properties of ethanol, measured by operant self-administration and the expression of an ethanol conditioned place preference, and abolished stress-induced reinstatement of ethanol seeking. NP078585 did not affect alcohol responses in mice lacking N-type calcium channels. These results suggest that selective calcium channel inhibitors may be useful in reducing acute ethanol intoxication and alcohol consumption by human alcoholics.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

Combination therapy for AD has garnered attention following a recent National Institute on Aging mandate, but this approach has not yet been fully validated. In this report, we combined the two most promising nutraceuticals with complementary anti-amyloidogenic properties: the plant-derived phenolics (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG, an α-secretase activator) and ferulic acid (FA, a β-secretase modulator). We used transgenic mice expressing mutant human amyloid β-protein precursor and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) to model cerebral amyloidosis. At 12 months of age, we orally administered EGCG and/or FA (30 mg/kg each) or vehicle once daily for 3 months. At 15 months, combined EGCG-FA treatment reversed cognitive impairment in most tests of learning and memory, including novel object recognition and maze tasks. Moreover, EGCG- and FA-treated APP/PS1 mice exhibited amelioration of brain parenchymal and cerebral vascular β-amyloid deposits and decreased abundance of amyloid β-proteins compared with either EGCG or FA single treatment. Combined treatment elevated nonamyloidogenic soluble APP-α and α-secretase candidate and down-regulated amyloidogenic soluble APP-β, β-C-terminal APP fragment, and β-secretase protein expression, providing evidence for a shift toward nonamyloidogenic APP processing. Additional beneficial co-treatment effects included amelioration of neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptotoxicity. Our findings offer preclinical evidence that combined treatment with EGCG and FA is a promising AD therapeutic approach.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1
376,24619358,Human molecular genetics,"Overexpression of the calpain-specific inhibitor calpastatin reduces human alpha-Synuclein processing, aggregation and synaptic impairment in [A30P]αSyn transgenic mice.","Lewy bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD), contain aggregated alpha-synuclein (αSyn), which is found in several modified forms and can be discovered phosphorylated, ubiquitinated and truncated. Aggregation-prone truncated species of αSyn caused by aberrant cleavage of this fibrillogenic protein are hypothesized to participate in its sequestration into inclusions subsequently leading to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death. Here, we investigated the role of calpain cleavage of αSyn in vivo by generating two opposing mouse models. We crossed into human [A30P]αSyn transgenic (i) mice deficient for calpastatin, a calpain-specific inhibitor, thus enhancing calpain activity (SynCAST(-)) and (ii) mice overexpressing human calpastatin leading to reduced calpain activity (SynCAST(+)). As anticipated, a reduced calpain activity led to a decreased number of αSyn-positive aggregates, whereas loss of calpastatin led to increased truncation of αSyn in SynCAST(-). Furthermore, overexpression of calpastatin decreased astrogliosis and the calpain-dependent degradation of synaptic proteins, potentially ameliorating the observed neuropathology in [A30P]αSyn and SynCAST(+) mice. Overall, our data further support a crucial role of calpains, particularly of calpain 1, in the pathogenesis of PD and in disease-associated aggregation of αSyn, indicating a therapeutic potential of calpain inhibition in PD.",Animal-drug-intervention,6,1

392,34230446,Am J Case Rep,Catatonia as the Initial Manifestation of Dementia with Lewy Bodies,"BACKGROUND Catatonia can occur in various neuropsychiatric disorders and is usually treated with benzodiazepines. So far, although 1 case of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) with catatonia has been reported, there have been no reports on patients with DLB whose initial symptom was a catatonia. Here, we present a patient who developed benzodiazepine-resistant catatonia and was subsequently diagnosed with DLB based on DLB biomarkers. CASE REPORT The patient was a 92-year-old woman who had not been diagnosed with dementia before. At the age of 91, she experienced catatonia and was initially treated with lorazepam, which did not improve her condition. Later, she transferred to our hospital and was treated with amantadine. Amantadine improved her catatonic symptoms; however, a decline in her cognitive function was observed. We therefore explored the cause of cognitive impairment through imaging studies. We found that the patient did not have the core clinical features of DLB (ie, visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) but had 2 indicative biomarkers on 123I-metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy and dopamine transporter imaging. Possible DLB was diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria. CONCLUSIONS Our case study suggests that catatonia can be an initial symptom of DLB. Moreover, considering the plausible pathophysiology of catatonia in DLB, amantadine treatment may be the most rational choice for the condition when benzodiazepine treatment is ineffective.",Human-case-report,4,0

Multiple studies have found that patients with psychotic mood disorders demonstrate significantly poorer cognitive performance in a variety of areas than those with nonpsychotic mood disorders. The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Dementia Rating Scale, Second Edition (DRS-2) are widely used to measure cognitive functions in research on MDD with psychotic features. Established total raw score cut-offs of 24 on the MMSE and 137 on the DRS-2 in published manuals suggest possible global cognitive impairment and dementia, respectively. Limited research is available on these suggested cut-offs for patients with MDD with psychotic features. We document the therapeutic benefit of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is usually associated with short-term cognitive impairment, in a 68-year-old woman with psychotic depression whose MMSE and DRS-2 scores initially suggested possible global cognitive impairment and dementia. Over the course of four ECT treatments, the patient's MMSE scores progressively increased. After the second ECT treatment, the patient no longer met criteria for global cognitive impairment. With each treatment, depression severity, measured by the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, improved sequentially. Thus, the suggested cut-off scores for the MMSE and the DRS-2 in patients with MDD with psychotic features may in some cases produce false-positive indications of dementia.",Human-case-report,4,0

We employed FISH and array CGH techniques for a better definition and refinement of a double chromosome aberration associating a 17p microdeletion with partial monosomy 21q due to 1:3 meiotic segregation of a maternal reciprocal translocation t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2) revealed after banding analysis. Brain MRI depicted partial callosal and mild diffuse cerebral atrophies, but without expected signs of lissencephaly. The patient's karyotype formula was: 45,XY,der(17)t(17;21)(p13.3;q21.2)mat,-21. FISH study confirmed these rearrangements and array CGH analysis estimated the loss sizes to at least 635 kb on chromosome 17 and to 15.6 Mb on chromosome 21. The absence of lissencephaly and major brain malformations often associated with 17p terminal deletions could be attributed to the retention of PAFAH1B1, YWHAE and CRK genes. Dysmorphic features, moderate mental impairment and minor brain malformations could result from the 21q monosomy and particularly the partial deletion of the APP-SOD1 region. Azoospermia should result from gamete apoptosis induced by a control mechanism triggered in response to chromosome imbalances.

Interestingly, some lymphoma cells form characteristic spindle shapes; these cells are found in some variants of malignant lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma, but they have not been reported in PCNSL or LC. Here, we provide an autopsy case report of LC in a 69-year-old immunocompetent man who developed rapidly progressive cognitive decline and died on day 68 after the episode despite treatment with intravenous methylprednisolone administration. MRI revealed high signal intensities on T2-weighted images of the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord without gadolinium enhancement on T1-weighted images. On autopsy, diffuse infiltrative atypical cells were seen; these cells were positive for CD20 and CD79a and negative for GFAP, CD3, and CD5 on immunohistochemistry, resulting in a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, specifically LC. We found characteristic spindle-shaped cells, especially in the cerebral cortex. This is the first report showing that lymphoma cells in PCNSL can take on a spindle-shaped form. It is difficult to recognize these spindle-shaped cells as lymphoma cells on hematoxylin and eosin staining and diagnose them correctly with small biopsy specimens without immunohistochemistry.

No psychiatric tests were performed but all other tests were repeatedly normal; antianxiety treatments or painkillers were the common outcome. It may seem that any diagnosis rested on the patient's immediately apparent social circumstances. Indeed, the patient was admitted to our internal medicine department after a diagnosis of acute delirium within a context of social disadvantage. This social predicament, namely, the patient's evident homelessness, proved to be a false but significant and overarching influence on several misdiagnoses until that moment. Subsequently, actual psychological observations, assessments and tests indicated and confirmed the presence of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an uncommon and fatal disease; however, early diagnosis can enable the implementation of an important palliative care program. The starkly impoverished social circumstances of a patient should never distract a medical practitioner from a comprehensive diagnosis.

406,31409401,BMC pediatrics,A unique case of acute brain haemorrhage with left ventricular systolic failure requiring ECMO.,"Acute left ventricular (LV) systolic failure as a consequence of acute severe brain injury with status epilepticus in a young infant is not common; managing such a patient on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), which requires proper anticoagulation adds further substrate to a particularly intriguing and novel case worthy of reporting. Takotsubo syndrome and its peculiar clinical presentation is not commonly reported in the paediatric population, yet the high likelihood of this diagnosis joining the dots up for this case invites our curiosity and reflection through the clinical management of this case.	A previously healthy 9-month-old local Chinese boy presented with generalised seizures secondary to acute severe brain injury, with signs of sympathetic overdrive, followed by rapidly progressive cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure, eventually requiring ECMO support. Neuroimaging at presentation revealed bilateral subdural haemorrhages. His cardiac function recovered within the next 24 h revealing the reversibility nature of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.	This is a captivating case depicting a series of unfortunate and unpredictable clinical events occurring in a previously well infant, which at initial presentation challenged the managing team with regards to its exact aetiology of acute brain injury and acute cardiorespiratory failure. Consideration of various differential diagnoses and finally narrowing down to that of stress-induced reversible cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome) following his intracranial bleed, versus that of coexisting dual pathology - acute brain injury with concomitant acute viral myocarditis, deepened our understanding of the pathophysiology of each disease process, and how it possibly interlinks between different organ systems.",Human-case-report,4,0

A 53-year-old female had developed slowly progressive dementia and atactic gait since the age of 45. No myoclonic jerks and periodic synchronous discharges were observed throughout the illness. The neuropathological study revealed that many amyloid plaques and widespread Alzheimer's neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) appeared in the cerebral cortex. Characteristically, the plaques reacted with anti-prion protein and none of them reacted with anti-beta protein, and they were made of many components, including amyloid cores, macrophages laden with lipid granules and/or degenerated neurites. Neuropil threads were seen mainly in amyloid plaques. Moreover, plaques appeared which were confluent and laminar in arrangement in the fifth and sixth cortical layers and had a close relationship to the neuronal loss. There was no spongiform change in the cerebral cortex or cerebellum. The cerebellum was almost intact except for a few amyloid plaques. Ultrastructurally, some of the plaques simulated kuru plaques and others had many degenerated neurites possessing paired helical filaments and other accumulated organelles. GSS has been proposed to include cases with progressive ataxia, dementia and massive multifocal plaques in the brain with or without cerebral spongiform changes. The case presented here is a very peculiar case of GSS. Recently, similar cases have been reported in some large families, diagnosed as familial Alzheimer's disease. These cases may be a telencephalic form with numerous NFTs of GSS.",Human-case-report,4,0

The main reason for pharmacological treatment of FASD children is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and methylphenidate (MPH) is the drug of choice. The aim of the study was to assess whether children born of hPAE with ADHD, with or without morphological FASD, differ in terms of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) and dopamine receptor D2 (DRD2) gene polymorphisms, and if genetic predisposition affects response and safety of MPH treatment. The polymorphisms of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) were analyzed in DNA samples. A borderline significance was found for the correlation between MPH side effects and the G allele of COMT (rs4680) (p = 0.04994) in all ADHD children. No effect of COMT (rs4680) and DRD2 (rs1076560, rs1800497) polymorphisms and the treatment efficacy was observed. The analyzed DRD2 and COMT gene polymorphisms seem to play no role in MPH efficacy in ADHD children with hPAE, while low-activity COMT (Met158) variant carriers may be more intolerant to MPH. The MPH treatment is effective in ADHD independent of FASD, although the ADHD-FASD variant requires higher doses to be successful. These results may help in optimization and individualization in child psychiatry.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

All patients and comparison participants (n = 9) completed baseline 31P-MRSI scans, and 9 patients completed posttherapy scans. The percentage changes for MADRS scores (Week 2, -23.8; Week 3, -34.9; Week 4, -42.5) and the time effects of TAU on MADRS scores (Week 2, z = -2.07, p = .039; Week 3, z = -4.28, p < .001; Week 4, z = -4.54, p < .001) may reflect TAU effects on early symptom improvement. TAU responders (patients who had a 50% or greater reduction in MADRS scores from baseline at any time) demonstrated a significant difference from nonresponders in pH changes from baseline (effect size = 150). These results suggest that TAU treatment may decrease symptoms of depression and improve mitochondrial functioning.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

We aimed to assess the uptake of slow-release oral morphine (SROM) as second-line OAT among medically ill, hospitalised patients with opioid use disorder who declined buprenorphine and methadone.	This study included consecutive hospitalised patients with untreated moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder referred to an inpatient addiction medicine consultation service, between June 2018 and September 2019, in Nova Scotia, Canada. We assessed the proportion of patients initiating first-line OAT (buprenorphine or methadone) in-hospital, and the proportion initiating SROM after declining first-line OAT. We compared rates of outpatient OAT continuation (i.e., filling outpatient OAT prescription or attending first outpatient OAT clinic visit) by medication type, and compared OAT selection between patients with and without chronic pain, using χ[2] tests.	Thirty-four patients were offered OAT initiation in-hospital; six patients (18%) also had chronic pain. Twenty-one patients (62%) initiated first-line OAT with buprenorphine or methadone. Of the 13 patients who declined first-line OAT, seven (54%) initiated second-line OAT with SROM in-hospital. Rates of outpatient OAT continuation after hospital discharge were high (>80%) and did not differ between medications (P = 0.4). Patients with co-existing chronic pain were more likely to choose SROM over buprenorphine or methadone (P = 0.005).	The ability to offer SROM (in addition to buprenorphine or methadone) increased rates of OAT initiation among hospitalised patients. Increasing access to SROM would help narrow the opioid use disorder treatment gap of unmet need.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
415,29580855,Journal of vascular surgery,Statin therapy is associated with higher long-term but not perioperative survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm repair.,"Although preoperative and perioperative statin therapy improves postoperative outcomes in several populations, few data examine its association with survival after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair. In addition, no data exist regarding the benefits of starting statins in patients with AAA not currently taking them.	We performed a registry-based study of all patients undergoing repair of AAAs in the Vascular Quality Initiative between 2003 and 2017 without documented statin intolerance. In our primary analysis, we evaluated the association between preoperative statin therapy and long-term mortality, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital myocardial infarction and stroke. As a secondary analysis, we studied the cohort of patients not taking a statin preoperatively and compared their long-term mortality on the basis of whether they were discharged on a statin. To account for nonrandom assignment to treatment, we constructed propensity scores and applied inverse probability weighting.	We identified 40,452 AAA repairs, of which 37,950 fit our entry criteria (29,257 endovascular and 8693 open). Overall, 25,997 patients (69%) were taking a statin preoperatively, with patients undergoing endovascular aneurysm repair more frequently taking a statin than those undergoing open repair (69% compared with 66%; P < .001). After propensity weighting, preoperative statin therapy was not associated with 30-day death or in-hospital stroke or myocardial infarction. However, patients taking statins preoperatively experienced higher adjusted 1-year (94% vs 90%) and 5-year (85% vs 81%) survival from the date of surgery compared with those who were not (P < .001 overall), although subgroup analysis showed that this applied only to intact or symptomatic aneurysms. Of the 11,941 patients not taking a statin preoperatively and discharged alive, 2910 (24%) started on a statin before discharge. In our secondary analysis of the subset of patients not taking statins preoperatively, those initiated on a statin before discharge experienced higher survival at 1 year (94% vs 91%) and 5 years (89% vs 81%; P < .001 overall) than those who remained off statin therapy, with the greatest absolute long-term survival difference in patients with rupture (87% vs 62%; P < .001 overall).	Preoperative statin therapy is associated with higher long-term survival but not perioperative mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing AAA repair, and initiating statin therapy in previously statin-naive patients is associated with markedly higher survival. All patients with AAAs without contraindications should receive statin therapy. In patients not taking a statin at the time of AAA repair, clinicians should consider initiating one before discharge.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Open study.	36 children ranging in age from 3 to 17 years who fit the diagnostic criteria for ADHD.	AD-FX capsules were taken twice a day on an empty stomach for 4 weeks. Patients were instructed not to change any other medications during the study.	At the beginning of the study, after 2 weeks, and then at the end of the 4-week trial, parents completed the Conners' Parent Rating Scale--revised, long version, a questionnaire that assesses a broad range of problem behaviours (and was used as an indication of ADHD symptom severity).	After 2 weeks of treatment, the proportion of the subjects exhibiting improvement (i.e., decrease in T-score of at least 5 points) ranged from 31% for the anxious-shy attribute to 67% for the psychosomatic attribute. After 4 weeks of treatment, the proportion of subjects exhibiting improvement ranged from 44% for the social problems attribute to 74% for the Conners' ADHD index and the DSM-IV hyperactive-impulsive attribute. Five (14%) of 36 subjects reported adverse events, only 2 of which were considered related to the study medication.	These preliminary results suggest AD-FX treatment may improve symptoms of ADHD and should encourage further research on the use of ginseng and Ginkgo biloba extracts to treat ADHD symptoms.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

A retrospective cohort study using a Medicaid claims database was conducted. Patients hospitalized for an AMI and subsequently filling a prescription for an ACE inhibitor were followed longitudinally for the occurrence of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and all-cause mortality. A subanalysis was also conducted to account for switching/discontinuation of ACE inhibitor therapy. Stepwise (forward conditional) Cox-proportional hazards models were used to analyze the effect of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	The final study sample consisted of 689 AMI and the results indicated that tissue-selective ACE inhibitors had a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/transient ischemic attack (TIA) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.265; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.101-0.698). A similar lower rate in hospitalizations due to heart failure was observed in the group using tissue-selective ACE inhibitors; however, the results were not statistically significant (HR = 0.681; 95% CI = 0.436-1.063). A protective effect was also observed on the combined outcome of hospitalization due to any cardiovascular condition (HR = 0.712; 95% CI = 0.536-0.945). Hospitalizations due to recurrent AMI, need for coronary revascularization procedures, and mortality were not significantly different between patients using tissue-selective and non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors. The completer subanalysis provided similar findings regarding the impact of tissue selectivity on study outcomes.	Tissue-selective ACE inhibitors may have a protective effect against hospitalization due to stroke/TIA or heart failure when compared to non-tissue-selective ACE inhibitors for patients following AMI.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

In an effort to better understand how varied these practices are, we surveyed 261 neurosurgeons with an expressed interest in pediatric neurosurgery, of whom 149 (57%) responded. The survey contained questions pertaining to preoperative and intraoperative management, choice of shunt valve, treatment philosophies with respect to shunt revision, evaluation process for potential shunt malfunction, treatment strategies for shunt infections and routine follow-up care.

We sought to evaluate the safety of tPA use without coagulation results and its impact on prognosis. In our stroke registry, tPA was delivered with coagulation results from December 2015 to April 2016 and without coagulation results from May 2016 to December 2016. Differences of demographics, clinical characteristic, and prognosis between these two groups were analyzed. In addition, logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors for DNT of over 60 min. A total of 201 stroke patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 81 patients received tPA with coagulation results and 120 patients without coagulation results. Only one (0.8%) patient with abnormal coagulation results met the exclusion criteria of tPA use in patients without coagulation results. The difference of DNT between groups with (mean, 61.7 min) and without (mean, 41.9 min) coagulation results was significant (P = 0.00). The group without coagulation results had a higher rate of favorable 90-day outcome (74.2 vs 70.4%) and lower rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage/nonintracranial hemorrhage (4.9 and 22.2% vs 1.7 and 19.2%) than the group with coagulation results did; these differences were not statistically significant. In multivariate analysis, only tPA use with coagulation results was the predictor for DNT of over 60 min (P = 0.0030, OR = 2.44, 95% CI 1.28-4.65). The present study suggests that tPA could be delivered safely without coagulation results in patients without suspected coagulopathy, and avoiding coagulation tests reduces significantly the DNT interval.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
420,34309908,Journal of pineal research,Treatment of isolated REM sleep behavior disorder using melatonin as a chronobiotic.,"Melatonin is recommended as a first-line treatment in isolated REM sleep behavior disorder (iRBD), although no large patient group has been reported. To assess effects, time course and confounding factors in the treatment of patients with iRBD using melatonin, 209 consecutive patients were included in this single-center, observational cohort study. A total of 171 patients had taken melatonin according to our chronobiotic protocol (2 mg, ≥6 months, always-at-the-same-clock time, 10-11pm, corrected for chronotype), 13 had applied melatonin for about 1-3 months, and 25 underwent mixed treatments. In total, 1529 clinical evaluations were performed, including Clinical Global Impression (CGI) and a newly developed RBD symptom severity scale (Ikelos-RS), analyzed using linear mixed models. Validation of Ikelos-RS showed excellent inter-rater reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001), test-retest reliability (ρ = 0.9, P < .001) and convergent validity (ρ = 0.9, P < .001). With melatonin, RBD symptom severity gradually improved over the first 4 weeks of treatment (Ikelos-RS: 6.1 vs. 2.5; CGI Severity: 5.7 vs. 3.2) and remained stably improved (mean follow-up 4.2 ± 3.1years; range: 0.6-21.7years). Initial response was slowed to up to 3 months with melatonin-suppressing (betablockers) or REM sleep spoiling co-medication (antidepressants) and failed with inadequately timed melatonin intake. When melatonin was discontinued after 6 months, symptoms remained stably improved (mean follow-up after discontinuation of 4.9 ± 2.5years; range: 0.6-9.2). When administered only 1-3 months, RBD symptoms gradually returned. Without any melatonin, RBD symptoms persisted and did not wear off over time. Clock-timed, low-dose, long-term melatonin treatment in patients with iRBD appears to be associated with the improvement of symptoms. The outlasting improvement over years questions a pure symptomatic effect. Clock-time dependency challenges existing prescription guidelines for melatonin.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Substantial improvements were observed in bone pain (BP), bone crises (BC), and bone mineral density (BMD). Improvements in BP were observed at 3 months (p < 0.001 vs baseline) and continued progressively throughout the study, with 39% of patients reporting pain at 48 months vs 73% at baseline. Eleven of the 13 patients with a pre-treatment history of BC had no recurrences. Biochemical markers for bone formation increased; markers for bone resorption decreased. Steady improvement of spine and femoral neck BMD, measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry was noted. Mean Z score for spine increased from -0.72 +/- 1.302 at baseline to near-normal levels (-0.09 +/- 1.503) by month 48 (p = 0.042) and for femoral neck from -0.59 +/- 1.352 to -0.17 +/- 1.206 (p = 0.035) at month 36.

426,3674795,Ann Neurol,Effects of oral physostigmine in Alzheimer's disease,"Previous studies of oral physostigmine in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease have: (1) assumed physostigmine is effective only in mildly affected patients; (2) relied on an initial ""dose-finding"" phase to determine the most effective dose and excluded nonresponders; and (3) primarily assessed memory. We examined the response of 22 patients to six different daily dosages of oral physostigmine, using selective reminding tests that were administered twice daily. Nine patients had a ""best"" dose/day (mode = 13 mg/day), which was used in a subsequent double-blind crossover study. The other 13 were given the highest tolerated dose. The selective reminding test and a full neuropsychological battery were given during the drug and placebo periods. As a group, the 22 patients improved significantly on the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised Digit Symbol subtest and a shape cancellation task (p less than 0.05). Nine patients showed improved performance on the selective reminding test during physostigmine treatment, and 9 showed no response; 4 patients performed better during placebo treatment. Dose finding did not help in predicting response in the crossover study; only 2 of the 9 who showed improvement had a best dose. Dementia severity did not predict crossover response. This suggests that: (1) physostigmine as administered had no pronounced effect on memory in Alzheimer's disease; (2) oral physostigmine produces no greater benefits on memory in mildly than in moderately demented patients; (3) response in a dose-finding phase does not predict response in double-blind crossover; and (4) Digit Symbol and cancellation tasks may be more sensitive than memory tests to the effects of oral physostigmine.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
427,15538265,The Journal of urology,The role of sildenafil in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in patients with pelvic fracture urethral disruption.,"Erectile dysfunction (ED) is a common sequel of pelvic fracture urethral disruption (PFUD). After repair of the urethral injury ED may be the most devastating long-term effect for the patient. Some patients with ED may regain normal erectile function. We prospectively studied the response to sildenafil and the erectile function of patients with ED due to PFUD.	The erectile function of patients referred to us with PFUD for urethroplasty were prospectively evaluated before surgery. Patients underwent nocturnal penile tumescence testing and, if results were abnormal, penile duplex ultrasonography with intracavernous injection and arteriography were performed to diagnose the etiology of ED. Patients were questioned about erectile function every 3 months after surgery and if they complained of ED they were offered 100 mg sildenafil. Patients were followed for at least 18 months after surgery.	A total of 29 consecutive patients were evaluated and 22 (76%) of them had ED before surgery. Sufficient followup was available for 15 of the patients. Overall 47% of these patients responded favorably to sildenafil. Of the patients 60% with neurogenic ED and 20% of those with arterial ED responded to this treatment. In 33% of the patients ED resolved within the followup period. All patients with spontaneous resolution of ED previously responded to sildenafil (71% of sildenafil responders).	In patients with ED due to PFUD, those with neurogenic ED are more likely to respond to sildenafil than those with arterial damage. Favorable response to sildenafil may predict spontaneous resumption of normal erectile function over time.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
428,8933611,The Psychiatric clinics of North America,Working with difficult-to-treat eating disorders using an integration of twelve-step and traditional psychotherapies.,"In summary, we have a multidimensional treatment program that attempts to integrate psychodynamic, cognitive-behavioral, systemic, psychopharmacologic, and 12-step interventions. For patients who have not had previous treatments or patients who are young adolescents, we do not emphasize the 12-step approach. For our difficult-to-treat patients, our current overall impression is that the benefits of adding the 12-step component have outweighed the costs. We began the program with an expressed intent of experimenting with the integration. Staff were subsequently recruited who were open to the experiment and the success of the integration has been a function of the flexibility within the staff. Our hunch is that this integration would not work as well with an existing staff who harbored prejudice toward either position. Actually, we have found working on the integration quite invigorating. Our recovering counselors have raised issues that we have not heard raised in the more traditional settings we have been associated with. Likewise, we have seen our counselors grow professionally from hearing alternative views of why individuals struggle and how they get better. The exchange has been synergistic rather than divisive. Although we are encouraged by our early experience, it is the long-term outcome that will clarify the relative usefulness of this treatment strategy. We are confident that as we live with the integration longer, more of the advantages and disadvantages will become apparent and perhaps we can refine our understanding of which subgroup of patients makes most use of this type of integrated approach.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Both thyroid-stimulating hormone and prolactin responses to thyrotropin-releasing hormone stimulation were within normal ranges in all subjects. The luteinizing hormone response to luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, was slightly weaker in non-responders. There were no differences in the insulin tolerance test between responders and non-responders. Unusually delayed or prolonged growth hormone response to arginine infusion was observed in non-responders.

There have been reports suggesting that amoxapine itself or its metabolites have neuroleptic as well as antidepressant properties. With in vitro studies using a radioreceptor assay for neuroleptics, the authors found that amoxapine--and one of its metabolites in particular (7-hydroxyamoxapine)--have potent neuroleptic-like activity. Furthermore, blood specimens from patients receiving amoxapine showed the presence of neuroleptic activity in the same assay.

431,11697523,J Neurol,Riluzole in Huntington's disease (HD): an open label study with one year follow up,"In an open label study, we administered riluzole (50 mg twice a day) to nine patients with genetically confirmed Huntington's disease (HD) (clinical stages 1-3; mean age 46.4 (SD 9.3) years; mean disease duration 8 (SD 3.3) years). The study was designed to evaluate (1) safety and tolerability of riluzole and (2) effects of riluzole on motor impairment, functional disability, cognitive impairment, and behavioral abnormalities using the Unified HD Rating Scale. Patients were evaluated at baseline and after three and twelve months of riluzole therapy. Laboratory tests (hematology and liver enzymes) were repeated monthly. All adverse experiences, reported spontaneously or observed directly by the investigator, were recorded. Riluzole was well tolerated. No increase of serum liver enzymes was seen throughout the study in all but one patient showing a mild elevation. At three months, mean total motor scale (TMS), mean TMS chorea subscore, and mean total functional capacity scale were significantly improved compared with baseline. At twelve months, however, this beneficial effect on motor status and overall function was not sustained. In contrast, severity and frequency of behavioral dysfunction as well as psychomotor speed assessed by the symbol digit modalities test were improved compared with baseline. Our data suggest that there are transient antichoreatic effects and more sustained effects of riluzole on psychomotor speed and behavior in patients with HD. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial appears highly warranted to establish definitely the symptomatic versus neuroprotective actions of riluzole in HD.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

This endeavour was possible through cooperation of all community pharmacies and their representative organizations was supported at the time by the former Health federal minister. The Liberal belgian opiate medical substitution process authorizes untill now de facto any doctor to prescribe methadone and pharmacists are supported to dispense it. Results show the regional, provincial and county numbers of professionals and patients prevalence in the population.

Subutex or Suboxone have been dispensed to 11,1% of substitution patients with 7,4% receiving only buprenorphine on a yearly basis. Number of substitution patients by MD and prevalence by gender, age group and region are presented. Important variations are observed locally, possibly mirroring heroin addiction due to widespread access to substitution treatment. Younger patients are more prevalent in semi rural or border areas. The exhaustivity of available data enables also to observe patients quitting substitution altogether and a strong difference of maintenance rate is observed favoring methadone over buprenorphine.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
433,11030483,J Clin Psychiatry,"A naturalistic comparison of clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine in the treatment of bipolar disorder","BACKGROUND: Our purpose was to evaluate the overall efficacy and tolerability of novel antipsychotic medications for patients with bipolar disorder type I. METHOD: A retrospective study of the Massachusetts General Hospital Bipolar Clinic database was carried out to identify 50 consecutive treatment trials in patients with DSM-IV bipolar disorder type I who had received adjunctive treatment with risperidone, olanzapine, or clozapine, along with standard mood stabilizers. The treatment charts of those patients (N = 42) were reviewed for details of adverse effects, tolerability, and efficacy of medication. RESULTS: Overall results indicated equivalent efficacy in novel antipsychotic treatments according to change in Clinical Global Impressions scale score. Levels of extrapyramidal symptoms were similar in all groups and occurred in 12/42 patients (28.6%). Prolactin-related side effects were not observed in any patients. There were no cases of affective switch or worsening of mania. Substantial weight gain of more than 10 lb (4.5 kg) was significantly greater in patients treated with olanzapine. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the efficacy and tolerability of risperidone, olanzapine, and clozapine are similar in patients with bipolar disorder. One major differentiation factor of these drugs appears to be weight gain, particularly between olanzapine and risperidone. This may, in part, also be related to the need to use mood-stabilizing agents, like lithium or divalproex sodium, which may potentiate the weight-gain effect of novel antipsychotics.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Comparison was made with a group of young women.	Participants included 26 postmenopausal women (age 58-72 years, 16 HT users, 10 non-users), 11 young women (age 20-26 years). They spent four consecutive nights in the sleep laboratory. Cognitive tests of attention, working memory, and verbal episodic memory were carried out after the baseline night, 25-h sleep deprivation, and recovery night.	Sleep deprivation impaired performance in all groups. It was manifested either as delayed practice effect or deteriorated performance (p < 0.05). In simple reaction time and 10-choice reaction time, non-users and young maintained their performance, whereas HT users suffered a minor impairment (p < 0.01). In other measurements, there was no interaction of group and condition. In 10-choice reaction time and vigilance, postmenopausal women made fewer errors and omissions than the young (p < 0.05). For most tasks, all groups showed improvement after one recovery night.	HT had a minor adverse effect on cognitive performance during sleep deprivation. Attention and memory deteriorated similarly in postmenopausal and young women, despite the lower initial performance level of postmenopausal women.

METHODS: This study was a 12-weeks, preliminary open-label trial. The subjects were 17 inpatients. Their extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) were assessed using the Drug-Induced Extrapyramidal Symptoms Scale (DIEPSS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and Barnes Akathisia Scale (BAS), and their cognitive function was assessed using the Brief Assessment Cognition in Schizophrenia: Japanese language version (BACS-J), and their clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of illness scale (CGI-S) at the 0 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: The DIEPSS and BAS significantly improved after switching from risperidone to PAL. Furthermore, improvement was found on AIMS. The mean change from baseline in z-score of the digit sequencing task was significantly increased. All items on the PANSS and CGI-S were not significant; however, changes in some cognitive function were correlated with changes in EPS. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest the possibility that switching elderly patients from risperidone to PAL may have improved pre-existing EPS, and may also have helped improve working memory.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0
437,35085001,Journal of child and adolescent psychopharmacology,Association of Lithium and Second-Generation Antipsychotics with Neurocognition in Youth with Bipolar Disorder.,"Objective: Numerous studies have examined the association of antimanic medications with neurocognition in adults with bipolar disorder (BD). However, few studies have examined this topic in youth. Thus, we aimed to examine the association of lithium and second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), the first-line antimanic medications for youth with BD, with neurocognition in a relatively large sample of youth with BD. Methods: Participants included 91 youth with BD-I, -II, or -Not Otherwise Specified, aged 13-20 years (n = 14 current lithium use, n = 51 current SGA use). We examined four tests from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery: Intra/Extra Dimensional Set-Shifting Task (IED), Rapid Visual Information Processing Task (RVP), Stockings of Cambridge Test (SOC), and Affective Go/No-Go (AGN). Within-sample Z-scores were computed, and a global neurocognitive composite score and g factor derived from these tests comprised the primary outcomes. Multivariable analyses controlled for age, sex, and IQ. Results: Current lithium use was significantly associated with poorer cognitive flexibility/set-shifting (IED). After further controlling for lifetime comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and current depression symptoms in sensitivity analyses, the lithium finding was no longer significant. Current SGA use was significantly associated with greater affective processing bias (AGN). No significant findings survived correction for multiple comparisons. All other cognitive outcomes were not significantly associated with current lithium use, current SGA use, or total number of current medications. Conclusions: Treatment with lithium or SGAs was associated with minimal neurocognitive impairments, with small effect sizes in primary multivariable analyses. This study adds to the limited body of literature examining medication use in relation to neurocognition in youth with BD. While the current study cannot rule out associations of smaller effect size, present findings suggest that leading mood-stabilizing medications are not associated with frank neurocognitive impairments in youth with BD.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Routine laboratory tests are insufficient to evaluate platelet activity.	To profile the spectrum of platelet inhibition, as measured by aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays, in a TBI population on antiplatelet therapy.	This single-center, prospective cohort study included patients presenting to our institution between November 2010 and January 2015 with a clinical history of TBI. Serum platelet reactivity levels were determined immediately on admission and analyzed using the aspirin and P2Y12 response unit assays; test results were reported as aspirin response units and P2Y12 response units. We report congruence between assay results and clinical history as well as differences in assay results between types of antiplatelet therapy.	A sample of 317 patients was available for analysis, of which 87% had experienced mild TBI, 7% moderate, and 6% severe; the mean age was 71.5 years. The mean aspirin response units in patients with a history of any aspirin use was 456 ± 67 (range, 350-659), with 88% demonstrating therapeutic platelet inhibition. For clopidogrel, the mean P2Y12 response unit was 191 ± 70 (range, 51-351); 77% showed therapeutic response.	Rapid measurement of antiplatelet function using the aspirin and P2Y12 response assays indicated as many as one fourth of patients on antiplatelet therapy do not have platelet dysfunction.

Patient survey-based analysis.	One hundred seventy-one patients (age range 34-86 yrs) who self-reported memory or other cognitive problems associated with statin therapy while participating in a previous statin effects study.	Patients completed a survey assessing statin-associated, cognitive-specific adverse drug reaction (ADR) characteristics, relation of the ADR to specific statin and dose (or potency), and time course of symptom onset and recovery. Visual analog scales were used to assess the effect of the cognitive ADRs on seven quality-of-life domains. Demographic and clinical data were also collected. To target cognitive ADRs with a probable or definite causal relationship to statins, the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was used: 128 patients (75%) experienced cognitive ADRs determined to be probably or definitely related to statin therapy. Of 143 patients (84%) who reported stopping statin therapy, 128 (90%) reported improvement in cognitive problems, sometimes within days of statin discontinuation (median time to first-noted recovery 2.5 wks). Of interest, in some patients, a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease reportedly was reversed. Nineteen patients whose symptoms improved or resolved after they discontinued statin therapy and who underwent rechallenge with a statin exhibited cognitive problems again (multiple times in some). Within this vulnerable group, a powerful relationship was observed between potency of the statin and fraction of trials with that agent resulting in cognitive ADRs (p<0.00001). Quality of life was significantly adversely affected for each of the seven assessed domains (all p<0.00000001).	Findings from the survey suggest that cognitive problems associated with statin therapy have variable onset and recovery courses, a clear relation to statin potency, and significant negative impact on quality-of-life.

Previous treatments were continued unchanged, and new treatments not permitted, except lorazepam up to 2 mg daily. Aripiprazole was dosed flexibly up to a maximum of 30 mg daily, based on tolerability and efficacy. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Mania Rating Scale (MRS) scores were used to assess changes in mood symptoms. Side effect outcomes were measured. Data was analyzed using last observation carried forward methodology and Analysis of Variance. RESULTS: Twenty patients (15 men, 5 women) with bipolar disorder (10 type I, 7 type II, 3 type NOS) enrolled in the study. Mean endpoint dose was 13.6 mg/d+/-10.0 mg/d. Thirteen (65%) patients completed 6 weeks of treatment. MADRS and MRS scores significantly improved during treatment. 44% of patients who completed at least one week of treatment were considered responders, based on > or =50% decrease in MADRS scores from baseline.

In a 16-week follow-up, SR-VF daily dose could be modified on the basis of the therapeutic response and of the side effect profile. Symptomatological modifications were explored by means of the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D), and Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A). SR-VF was well tolerated and only 2 patients interrupted the treatment before 24 weeks; the mean final dose +/- SD was 135.5 +/- 71.8 mg (range 75-225); in 26 (81.2%) patients, a statistically significant response was observed in depressive symptomatology within the first 8 weeks. The mean total score of HAM-D showed a significant reduction during the first 8 weeks of treatment, while the mean total score of HAM-A did not present a significant reduction until week 24. In patients with MD, a statistically significant response was observed after the first 8 weeks, while the reduction of the anxiety scores required more time and, in some cases, did not appear at all. Conversely, in patients with GAD and dysthymia, anxious and depressive symptomatology improved simultaneously. Stepwise multiple regression indicated that the improvement of depression is negatively related to a high score of CGI anxiety severity, and the improvement of anxiety is related to the presence of dysthymia and, to a lesser extent, to a short duration of the illness. Our data confirm the effectiveness and tolerability of SR-VF in mixed anxiety-depressive states. The differential response suggests a pathophysiologic and clinical distinction between GAD with comorbid MD or dysthymia.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

Felbamate is an investigational antiepileptic drug with a preclinical profile that suggests it would be effective in patients with multiple types of seizures. In controlled clinical trials, felbamate was superior to placebo in reducing the frequency of refractory partial-onset seizures.	We studied the efficacy of felbamate in 73 patients ranging in age from 4 to 36 years who had the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. During a 28-day base-line phase, the patients received their usual antiepileptic therapies. At the end of this phase, felbamate or placebo was administered for 70 days in addition to the current antiepileptic medications. The dosage of felbamate was titrated during the first 14 days of the treatment phase to a maximum of 45 mg per kilogram of body weight per day or 3600 mg per day, whichever was less. The primary efficacy variables were the total number of seizures counted during a four-hour period of video recording, parents' or guardians' global evaluations of the patients' quality of life, and the total number of atonic seizures, as reported by parents or guardians.	The patients treated with felbamate had a 34 percent decrease in the frequency of atonic seizures, as compared with a 9 percent decrease in the patients who received placebo (P = 0.01). The felbamate-treated patients had a 19 percent decrease in the total frequency of seizures, as compared with a 4 percent increase in the placebo group (P = 0.002). The global-evaluation scores were significantly higher in the felbamate group than in the placebo group from day 49 to the end of the study. There were no significant differences in the frequency of seizures occurring during video monitoring, but there was a significant reduction (P = 0.017) in the number of tonic-clonic seizures during the maintenance period in the felbamate group.

We investigated previously established clinical predictors of TESI and combined these with several polymorphisms of candidate genes in patients with major depressive disorder. Common polymorphisms involved in the tryptophan hydroxylase 1 (TPH1) and 2 (TPH2), serotonin transporter, monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated in a naturalistic inpatient study of the German research network on depression. We compared patients showing TESI with non-TESI suicidal patients and with non-suicidal patients using univariate tests to detect relevant factors, which were further tested in logistic regression and CART (Classification and Regression Trees) analyses. Of the 269 patients, TESI occurred in 22 patients (17 female), 117 patients were defined as non-TESI suicidal patients, and 130 patients were classified as non-suicidal. When comparing cases with both control groups we found the TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism to be moderately associated with TESI (Univariate tests: TESI vs. non-suicidality: p=0.005; adjusted: p=0.09; TESI vs. non-TESI suicidal patients: p=0.0024; adjusted: p=0.086). This polymorphism remained the only significant genetic factor in addition to clinical predictors in logistic regression and CART analyses. CART analyses suggested interactions with several clinical predictors. Haplotype analyses further supported a contribution of this polymorphism in TESI. The TPH2 rs1386494 (C/T) polymorphism might contribute to the genetic background of TESI. This polymorphism has been previously associated with committed suicide and major depressive disorder. The small number of cases warrants replication in larger patient samples. Lack of a placebo control group hampers definite conclusions on an association with antidepressive treatment.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

These pharmacogenetics findings have been reported from independent cohorts of patients mostly treated with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressant, and mirtazapine. Tianeptine, an atypical antidepressant, recently identified as a mu opioid receptor agonist, which prevents and reverses the stress induced by glucocorticoids, has been investigated in this present pharmacogenetics study. More than 3200 Caucasian outpatients with a major depressive episode (MDE) from real-life settings were herein analyzed for clinical response to tianeptine, a treatment initiated from 79.5% of the subjects, during 6-8 weeks follow-up, assessing polymorphisms targeting four genes involved in the HPA axis (NR3C1, FKPB5, CRHR1, and AVPR1B). We found a significant association (p < 0.001) between CRHR1 gene variants rs878886 and rs16940665, or haplotype rs878886*C-rs16940665*T, and tianeptine antidepressant response and remission according to the hospital anxiety and depression scale. Analyses, including a structural equation model with simple mediation, suggest a moderate effect of sociodemographic characteristics and depressive disorder features on treatment response in individuals carrying the antidepressant responder allele rs8788861 (allele C). These findings suggest direct pharmacological consequences of CRHR1 polymorphisms in the antidepressant tianeptine response and remission, in MDE patients. This study replicates the association of the CRHR1 gene, involved in the HPA axis, with (1) a specificity attributed to treatment response, (2) a lower risk of chance finding, and in (3) an ecological situation.",Human-non-RCT-drug-intervention,3,0

The expression of S100beta could be detected increasing in 2h, and increased significantly in 4h, and it reached apex 12h after DBI, and decreased gradually to the level less than normal 3d, and returned to normal 7d following injury. In the postmortem injury groups, there were no significant changes in anti-S100beta immunoreactivities in four areas of brain compared to the control group.	The present study showed the time-dependent expression of S100beta is obvious following diffuse brain injury, and suggested S100beta be suitable as a marker for brain injury age determination.",Animal-other,5,1
448,18712059,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,Acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia enhance adrenergic vasoconstriction and decrease calcitonin gene-related peptide-containing nerve-mediated vasodilation in pithed rats.,"Recent clinical studies have demonstrated that transient postprandial hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia may contribute to the development of hypertension. Therefore, we investigated the influence of acute hyperglycemia and/or hyperinsulinemia induced by glucose or insulin infusion on neuronal and humoral control of vascular tone in rats. Euglycemic male Wistar rats were pithed under anesthesia and arterial blood pressure was measured. Changes in vascular responses to spinal cord stimulation (SCS) and intravenous bolus injections of noradrenaline, angiotensin II, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied by infusing various concentrations of glucose or insulin. Continuous glucose infusion, which increased both blood glucose and serum insulin levels, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses to SCS without affecting pressor responses to injection of noradrenaline or angiotensin II. In pithed rats with artificially increased blood pressure and blockade of autonomic outflow, glucose infusion attenuated CGRPergic nerve-depressor responses to SCS without affecting depressor responses to injection of CGRP, acetylcholine or SNP. In pithed rats treated with octreotide, which increased blood glucose without increasing serum insulin levels, glucose infusion caused only significant augmentation of adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses. Combined infusion of insulin and glucose, which resulted in increased serum insulin levels with euglycemia, significantly augmented adrenergic nerve-mediated pressor responses and attenuated CGRPergic nerve-mediated depressor responses. The present results suggest that acute hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia increase adrenergic nerve-mediated vasoconstriction, which in turn blunts CGRPergic nerve function, and that the increase in plasma insulin concentration associated with hyperglycemia may be responsible for the alteration of neuronal vascular regulation.",Animal-other,5,1

Results were as follows. 1) Significant differences were not observed between the lead-exposed rats and the controls regarding the developmental landmarks in both the Wistar rats and THA rats. Body weight of the exposed rats, however, were significantly less than that of the controls of the two rat strains. 2) Low rate of avoidance, slow acquisition of learning and large individual variabilities were exhibited in both the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain throughout the test sessions. No significant difference was indicated between the controls and the exposed rats of the Wistar strain. In the control THA rats, avoidance learning was acquired rapidly, and a high level and very small individual variabilities of avoidance were demonstrated during the latter sessions of the test. Meanwhile, in the exposed THA rats, slow learning acquisition and large individual variabilities were displayed. It is thought that the learning impairment appearing in the THA exposed rats was induced primarily by lead.",Animal-other,5,1

Hosts' sexual dimorphism in cysticercosis has been largely explored in the murine model of intraperitoneal Taenia crassiceps cysticercosis. In this study, we investigated the sexual dimorphism of inflammatory responses in a rat model of extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis caused by T. crassiceps. T. crassiceps cysticerci were inoculated in the subarachnoid space of Wistar rats (25 females, 22 males). Ninety days later, the rats were euthanized for histologic, immunohistochemistry, and cytokines studies. Ten animals also underwent a 7-T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Female rats presented a higher concentration of immune cells in the arachnoid-brain interface, reactive astrogliosis in the periventricular region, in situ pro-inflammatory cytokine (interleukin [IL]-6) and anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), and more intense hydrocephalus on MRI than males. Intracranial hypertension signals were not observed during the observational period. Overall, these results suggest sexual dimorphism in the intracranial inflammatory response that accompanied T. crassiceps extraparenchymal neurocysticercosis.",Animal-other,5,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate the motor, cognitive and emotional changes associated with dopaminergic and BDNF imbalance after DM exposure in rats. Sixty Wistar rats (9-10 months-old) were used, under Ethics Committee on Animal Research license (ID 19/2017). The animals were randomly divided into four groups: control (CTL, 0.9% saline), DM2 (2 mg DM in 1.6 mL 0.9% saline), DM4 (4 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline), and DM8 (8 mg of DM in 1.6 mL of 0.9% saline). DM groups were submitted to 9 or 15 inhalations, one every 48 h. Half of the animals from each group were randomly selected and perfused 24 h after the 9th or 15th inhalation. Throughout the experiment, the animal's behavior were evaluated using catalepsy test, open field, hole-board test, Modified Elevated Plus Maze, and social interaction. At the end of the experiments, the rats were perfused transcardially and their brains were processed for Tyrosine Hydroxylase (TH) and Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) immunohistochemistries. The animals submitted to 9 inhalations of DM showed a reduction in immunoreactivity for TH in the Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), ventral tegmental area (VTA), and dorsal striatum (DS) areas, and an increase in BDNF in the DS and CA1, CA3 and dentate gyrus (DG) hippocampal areas. Conversely, the animals submitted to 15 inhalations of DM showed immunoreactivity reduced for TH in the SNpc and VTA, and an increase in BDNF in the hippocampal areas (CA3 and DG). Our results indicate that the DM inhalation at different periods induce motor and cognitive impairments in rats. Such alterations were accompanied by dopaminergic system damage and a possible dysfunction on synaptic plasticity.",Animal-other,5,1

Changes in free fatty acid liberation.,"Does the impaired lipid metabolism during non-lethal transient ischemia truly recover within a few hours after recirculation? In an attempt to answer this question, we first investigated the time course of the changes in the amount and composition of free fatty acids (FFAs) accumulated during 5-min ischemia and after various postischemic recirculation durations (3 min, 1 h, 24 h, 3 days, and 6 days) in the gerbil cerebral cortex. Then those of FFAs liberated in response to the second 5-min ischemia at various recirculation intervals (3 min, 1 h, 3 days, and 6 days) following the initial one were also measured to evaluate the changes in the cellular response. The former study disclosed that the FFA levels transiently returned to the control levels at 1-h recirculation, increased again a few days after the onset of recirculation, followed by the final return to the control levels after 6-day recirculation. The latter study disclosed that the cellular response to the second ischemia was quite different from that to the initial one even after 6-day recirculation, suggesting that membrane lipid metabolism had not yet been recovered even at such a late period. We discuss the significance of the alterations in lipid metabolism.",Animal-other,5,1

To investigate a possible relationship among the grade of brachycephaly, ventricular dilatation, and skull dysmorphologies in Persian cats.	92 Persian-, 10 Domestic shorthair cats.	The grade of brachycephaly was determined on skull models based on CT datasets. Cranial measurements were examined with regard to a possible correlation with relative ventricular volume, and cranial capacity. Persians with high (peke-face Persians) and lower grades of brachycephaly (doll-face Persians) were investigated for the presence of skull dysmorphologies.	The mean cranial index of the peke-face Persians (0.97 ± 0.14) was significantly higher than the mean cranial index of doll-face Persians (0.66 ± 0.04; P < 0.001). Peke-face Persians had a lower relative nasal bone length (0.15 ± 0.04) compared to doll-face (0.29 ± 0.08; P < 0.001). The endocranial volume was significantly lower in doll-face than peke-face Persians (89.6 ± 1.27% versus 91.76 ± 2.07%; P < 0.001).

A closed diffuse brain injury model was successfully produced in rat by hit the parietal bone with a spring-droved steel stick. The auditory brainstem response evoked by click at 50Hz stimulating frequency were recorded at pre-trauma, 15 min and 1, 3, 6, 12 h and 1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21 d after brain injury. The pathological changes of brain were observed under light microscope and the brain edema was detected by wet weight/dry weight rations.	The I-V, III-V of BAEP wave inter peak latency (IPL) in MTBI group increased immediately in 15 minutes after injury. The III, V wave peak latency (PL) and I-V, III-V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 6, 12 h post-injury (P<0.05). The III, V wave PL and I - III, I - V, III - V wave IPL became longer than the pre-trauma level in 1, 2 d after injury (P < 0.001), the BAEP retuned to normal level in 14 d after brain injury. At 15 minutes after injury, the water content in brain increased and met its peak in 1 d, decreased gradually in 4 d, then decreased slowly and returned to normal level in 10 d after injury.

455,23087000,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",Dedifferentiation of neurons and astrocytes by oncogenes can induce gliomas in mice.,"Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and aggressive malignant primary brain tumor in humans. Here we show that gliomas can originate from differentiated cells in the central nervous system (CNS), including cortical neurons. Transduction by oncogenic lentiviral vectors of neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocytes, or even mature neurons in the brains of mice can give rise to malignant gliomas. All the tumors, irrespective of the site of lentiviral vector injection (the initiating population), shared common features of high expression of stem or progenitor markers and low expression of differentiation markers. Microarray analysis revealed that tumors of astrocytic and neuronal origin match the mesenchymal GBM subtype. We propose that most differentiated cells in the CNS upon defined genetic alterations undergo dedifferentiation to generate a NSC or progenitor state to initiate and maintain the tumor progression, as well as to give rise to the heterogeneous populations observed in malignant gliomas.",Animal-other,5,1
456,28687401,Neurochemistry international,Pathophysiological role of prostaglandin E2-induced up-regulation of the EP2 receptor in motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells and lumbar motor neurons in ALS model mice.,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by selective degeneration of motor neurons. The primary triggers for motor neuronal death are still unknown, but inflammation is considered to be an important factor contributing to the pathophysiology of ALS both clinically and in ALS models. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and its corresponding four E-prostanoid receptors play a pivotal role in the degeneration of motor neurons in human and transgenic models of ALS. It has also been shown that PGE2-EP2 signaling in glial cells (astrocytes or microglia) promotes motor neuronal death in G93A mice. The present study was designed to investigate the levels of expression of EP receptors in the spinal motor neurons of ALS model mice and to examine whether PGE2 alters the expression of EP receptors in differentiated NSC-34 cells, a motor neuron-like cell line. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that EP2 and EP3 immunoreactivity was localized in NeuN-positive large cells showing the typical morphology of motor neurons in mice. Semi-quantitative analysis showed that the immunoreactivity of EP2 in motor neurons was significantly increased in the early symptomatic stage in ALS model mice. In contrast, the level of EP3 expression remained constant, irrespective of age. In differentiated NSC-34 cells, bath application of PGE2 resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease of MTT reduction. Although PGE2 had no effect on cell survival at concentrations of less than 10 μM, pretreatment with 10 μM PGE2 significantly up-regulated EP2 and concomitantly potentiated cell death induced by 30 μM PGE2. These results suggest that PGE2 is an important effector for induction of the EP2 subtype in differentiated NSC-34 cells, and that not only EP2 up-regulation in glial cells but also EP2 up-regulation in motor neurons plays a pivotal role in the vulnerability of motor neurons in ALS model mice.",Animal-other,5,1
457,36810252,JCI insight,UBE3A expression during early postnatal brain development is required for proper dorsomedial striatal maturation.,"Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder (NDD) caused by loss of functional ubiquitin protein ligase E3A (UBE3A). Previous studies showed that UBE3A plays an important role in the first postnatal weeks of mouse brain development, but its precise role is unknown. Since impaired striatal maturation has been implicated in several mouse models for NDDs, we studied the importance of UBE3A in striatal maturation. We used inducible Ube3a mouse models to investigate the maturation of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) from dorsomedial striatum. MSNs of mutant mice matured properly till postnatal day 15 (P15) but remained hyperexcitable with fewer excitatory synaptic events at later ages, indicative of stalled striatal maturation in Ube3a mice. Reinstatement of UBE3A expression at P21 fully restored MSN excitability but only partially restored synaptic transmission and the operant conditioning behavioral phenotype. Gene reinstatement at P70 failed to rescue both electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. In contrast, deletion of Ube3a after normal brain development did not result in these electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes. This study emphasizes the role of UBE3A in striatal maturation and the importance of early postnatal reinstatement of UBE3A expression to obtain a full rescue of behavioral phenotypes associated with striatal function in AS.",Animal-other,5,1
458,34526055,Molecular neurodegeneration,Adult-onset CNS myelin sulfatide deficiency is sufficient to cause Alzheimer's disease-like neuroinflammation and cognitive impairment.,"Human genetic association studies point to immune response and lipid metabolism, in addition to amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau, as major pathways in Alzheimer's disease (AD) etiology. Accumulating evidence suggests that chronic neuroinflammation, mainly mediated by microglia and astrocytes, plays a causative role in neurodegeneration in AD. Our group and others have reported early and dramatic losses of brain sulfatide in AD cases and animal models that are mediated by ApoE in an isoform-dependent manner and accelerated by Aβ accumulation. To date, it remains unclear if changes in specific brain lipids are sufficient to drive AD-related pathology.	To study the consequences of CNS sulfatide deficiency and gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we developed a novel mouse model of adult-onset myelin sulfatide deficiency, i.e., tamoxifen-inducible myelinating glia-specific cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) conditional knockout mice (CST[fl/fl]/Plp1-CreERT), took advantage of constitutive CST knockout mice (CST[-/-]), and generated CST/ApoE double knockout mice (CST[-/-]/ApoE[-/-]), and assessed these mice using a broad range of methodologies including lipidomics, RNA profiling, behavioral testing, PLX3397-mediated microglia depletion, mass spectrometry (MS) imaging, immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, and Western blot.	We found that mild central nervous system (CNS) sulfatide losses within myelinating cells are sufficient to activate disease-associated microglia and astrocytes, and to increase the expression of AD risk genes (e.g., Apoe, Trem2, Cd33, and Mmp12), as well as previously established causal regulators of the immune/microglia network in late-onset AD (e.g., Tyrobp, Dock, and Fcerg1), leading to chronic AD-like neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment. Notably, neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment showed gender differences, being more pronounced in females than males. Subsequent mechanistic studies demonstrated that although CNS sulfatide losses led to ApoE upregulation, genetically-induced myelin sulfatide deficiency led to neuroinflammation independently of ApoE. These results, together with our previous studies (sulfatide deficiency in the context of AD is mediated by ApoE and accelerated by Aβ accumulation) placed both Aβ and ApoE upstream of sulfatide deficiency-induced neuroinflammation, and suggested a positive feedback loop where sulfatide losses may be amplified by increased ApoE expression. We also demonstrated that CNS sulfatide deficiency-induced astrogliosis and ApoE upregulation are not secondary to microgliosis, and that astrogliosis and microgliosis seem to be driven by activation of STAT3 and PU.1/Spi1 transcription factors, respectively.	Our results strongly suggest that sulfatide deficiency is an important contributor and driver of neuroinflammation and mild cognitive impairment in AD pathology.",Animal-other,5,1

Annual Conference,Towards a method to study neurorobotic control in a rat model of spinal cord injury.,"Neurorobotic control of prosthetic devices may bea viable therapeutic intervention that provides spinal cord injury patients with the ability to use the neuronal activity of populations of single neurons to control an external device (i.e.cursor on a computer screen or robotic arm). However, we are limited by our understanding of how spinal cord injury alters the ability of these neurons to convey information about the intention to move. Therefore, there is a need to develop animal models that 1) describe how population of single neurons encode information about different behavioral tasks (skilled vs.unskilled), 2) determine how this encoding is modulated by spinal cord injury and 3) perform neurorobotic control after spinal cord injury. To address the first question, we developed a rat model of spinal cord transection to evaluate the effects of the injury on the neuronal activity related to hindlimb activity. The model consists of training the rat to press a pedal with its hindlimbs. This paper describes the method that defines both the magnitude and latency of a neuron's activity in terms of its Peri-Event Histogram relative to the animal's movements during the task. The method provides a means by which changes in neural activation can be correlated with changes in behavior.",Animal-other,5,1

The use of consistent protocols allowed compilation of these data, facilitating analyses of animal behaviors across experimental models, species, and gender. Spatial learning and sensorimotor/coordination data are presented, suggesting that, in general, rats performed better than mice both in the water maze and on the rotarod. Compared with females, males performed slightly better in the water maze and slightly worse on the rotarod. However, gender by species interactions accounted for both of these differences. Male rats performed better in the water maze than female rats, male mice, and female mice, which did not differ. Male mice performed worse on the rotarod than female mice, male rats, and female rats, which performed similarly. Furthermore, animals with subcortical injury were impaired in the water maze, but performed better than animals with cortical injuries. However, only animals with cortical injuries were impaired on the rotarod. Additional covariates, such as edema and lesion size, may further clarify these phenotypes. Overall, we provide evidence that abbreviated test batteries can be specifically designed to test deficits, depending on the species, gender, and model.",Animal-other,5,1

However, how the activity and neuroplasticity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) change after contextual morphine withdrawal conditioning and what factors determine this change remain to be determined. In this paper, using immunohistochemical and single-cell microinjection techniques, combining behavioral assay, we found that (1) contextual withdrawal conditioning increases the expression of c-Fos, but not Arc, in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (2) at the first day after conditioning, conditioned context has no influence on the expression of c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (3) at the 14th day after conditioning, conditioned context increases the expression of both c-Fos and Arc in the ACC in morphine withdrawal mice; (4) the inhibition of dendritic spines of the ACC or projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC attenuates the conditioned context-induced increase of Arc expression in the ACC and abolishes the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning. These results suggest that the ACC may exhibit a change in neuroplasticity at the 14th day after conditioning, and the dendritic spines of the ACC and the projection neurons from the CA3 of the hippocampus to the ACC are key determinants for conditioned context induced-increase in Arc expression in the ACC and the retrieval of withdrawal memory at the 14th day after conditioning.",Animal-other,5,1
462,20451518,Experimental neurology,Analysis of combinatorial variability reveals selective accumulation of the fibronectin type III domains B and D of tenascin-C in injured brain.,"Tenascin-C (Tnc) is a multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is markedly upregulated in CNS injuries where it is primarily secreted by reactive astrocytes. Different Tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven (in rats) alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type III (FnIII) domains to the smallest variant. Each spliced FnIII repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth, neuron migration or adhesion. Hence, different Tnc isoforms might differentially influence CNS repair. We explored the expression pattern of Tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines. Using RT-PCR, we observed a strong upregulation of Tnc transcripts containing the spliced FnIII domains B or D in injured tissue at 2-4 days post-lesion (dpl). Looking at specific combinations, we showed a dramatic increase of Tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowth-promoting BD repeat with both the B and D domains being adjacent to each other. Isoforms containing only the axon growth-stimulating spliced domain D were also dramatically enhanced after injury. Injury-induced increase of Tnc proteins comprising the domain D was confirmed by Western Blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions. In contrast, the FnIII modules C and AD1 were weakly modulated after injury. The growth cone repulsive A1A2A4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform, which is also repellant, was highly expressed after injury. Expression of the shortest Tnc isoform and of variants containing B, D or BD, was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after TGFbeta1 treatment, suggesting that TGFbeta1 could mediate, at least in part, the injury-induced upregulation of these isoforms. We identified complex injury-induced differential regulations of Tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged CNS.",Animal-other,5,1
463,25288671,Diabetes,Diabetic microangiopathy: impact of impaired cerebral vasoreactivity and delayed angiogenesis after permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion on stroke damage and cerebral repair in mice.,"Diabetes increases the risk of stroke by three, increases related mortality, and delays recovery. We aimed to characterize functional and structural alterations in cerebral microvasculature before and after experimental cerebral ischemia in a mouse model of type 1 diabetes. We hypothesized that preexisting brain microvascular disease in patients with diabetes might partly explain increased stroke severity and impact on outcome. Diabetes was induced in 4-week-old C57Bl/6J mice by intraperitoneal injections of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg). After 8 weeks of diabetes, the vasoreactivity of the neurovascular network to CO2 was abolished and was not reversed by nitric oxide (NO) donor administration; endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) mRNA, phospho-eNOS protein, nNOS, and phospho-nNOS protein were significantly decreased; angiogenic and vessel maturation factors (vascular endothelial growth factor a [VEGFa], angiopoietin 1 (Ang1), Ang2, transforming growth factor-β [TGF-β], and platelet-derived growth factor-β [PDGF-β]) and blood-brain barrier (BBB) occludin and zona occludens 1 (ZO-1) expression were significantly decreased; and microvessel density was increased without changes in ultrastructural imaging. After permanent focal cerebral ischemia induction, infarct volume and neurological deficit were significantly increased at D1 and D7, and neuronal death (TUNEL+ / NeuN+ cells) and BBB permeability (extravasation of Evans blue) at D1. At D7, CD31+ / Ki67+ double-immunolabeled cells and VEGFa and Ang2 expression were significantly increased, indicating delayed angiogenesis. We show that cerebral microangiopathy thus partly explains stroke severity in diabetes.",Animal-other,5,1

Regardless of rat sex, with the disease development xanthine oxidase (XO) activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression increased in spinal cord, whereas glutathione levels decreased. This was accompanied by the rise in spinal cord malondialdehyde level. On the other hand, with EAE development superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity decreased, while O2[-] concentration increased only in spinal cord of male rats. Consequently, SOD activity was lower, whereas O2[-] concentration was higher in spinal cord of male rats with clinically manifested EAE. XO activity and iNOS mRNA expression were also elevated in their spinal cord. Consistently, in the effector phase of EAE the concentration of advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) was higher in spinal cord of male rats, which exhibit more severe neurological deficit than their female counterparts. In as much as data obtained in the experimental models could be translated to humans, the findings may be relevant for designing sex-specific antioxidant therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, the study indicated that the increased pro-oxidant-antioxidant balance in plasma may be an early indicator of EAE development. Moreover, it showed that plasma AOPP level may indicate not only actual activity of the disease, but also serve to predict severity of its course.",Animal-other,5,1
465,4075172,Brain research,Thiamine deficiency depletes cortical norepinephrine and impairs learning processes in the rat.,"Several lines of evidence indicate that thiamine deficiency causes the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a human memory disorder. The present study examined behavioral deficits in rats after recovery from a bout of thiamine deficiency. Following behavioral testing, the brains were dissected into regions and assayed biochemically for levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and the primary metabolites of these monoamines. Based on previous findings in this laboratory, we predicted that thiamine deficiency not only produces behavioral deficits but loss in catecholamines as well. Impairments were observed for a spatial delayed alternation task that had been learned prior to experimental treatment. In addition, experimental animals were impaired in their ability to acquire two novel tasks, active and passive shock avoidance, after recovery from the acute effects of thiamine deficiency. Comparable deficits were not observed for a number of reflex responses that were measured to assess the general neurological state of the animals. Biochemical analyses revealed that the concentration of norepinephrine was reduced significantly in cortex-hippocampus and olfactory bulb but not in other regions, while dopamine and serotonin levels were not altered in any brain region examined. These data demonstrate that a bout of thiamine deficiency can produce persistent deficits in brain norepinephrine and concomitant decrements in behavioral measures of learning and memory. These results are consistent with our hypothesis and evidence that noradrenergic deficits contribute to the amnesic symptoms of Korsakoff's psychosis.",Animal-other,5,1

After intracerebral inoculation, the virus produced meningoencephalitis in monkeys, cotton rats, hamsters, guinea pigs, and rabbits; after intracutaneous inoculation a necrotic skin lesion was produced in the monkey and rabbit and this was often followed by myelitis. The virus could also be passed in newborn mice less than 48 hours old and in chick embryos by inoculation of the chorioallantoic membrane. Immunological and host range studies revealed this virus to be related to the B virus originally described by Sabin and Wright in 1934 (1). To our knowledge this is the first record of B virus having been isolated from a monkey, and lends support to the inclusion of this agent as the simian member of the herpes group. The infection is not uncommon in monkey stocks, as revealed by the finding of antibodies to the virus in their sera. In the present series 9 of 44 monkeys gave positive antibody tests. Gamma globulin prepared in the United States in 1945, 1951, and 1953, as well as a certain proportion of sera from normal individuals in Bombay, India, and elsewhere, showed neutralizing activity against the new strain of B virus, and also to herpes simplex virus.

However, the exact mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains unknown since plasmatic cholesterol is not able to cross the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, we evaluated the hypothesis that cognitive impairments triggered by hypercholesterolemia during aging may be related to brain oxidative stress and altered brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. We also performed a neuropathological investigation in order to analyze whether the cognitive impairments may be associated with stroke-related features. To address these questions we used three- and fourteen-month-old low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLr-/-). The current findings provide new evidence that aged LDLr-/- mice, exposed to over three-fold cholesterol levels from early life, show working, spatial reference, and procedural memory impairments, without alterations in motor function. Antioxidant imbalance and oxidative damage were evidenced by a marked increase in lipid peroxidation (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances levels) and glutathione metabolism (increase in glutathione levels, glutathione reductase, and glutathione peroxidase activities) together with a significant increase in the AChE activity in the prefrontal cortex of aged hypercholesterolemic LDLr-/- mice. Notably, hypercholesterolemia was not related to brain infarcts and neurodegeneration in mice, independent of their age. These observations provide new evidence that hypercholesterolemia during aging triggers cognitive impairments on different types of learning and memory, accompanied by antioxidant imbalance, oxidative damage, and alterations of cholinergic signaling in brain areas associated with learning and memory processes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex.",Animal-other,5,1
469,3095713,Neuroscience letters,Two types of electrocortical paroxysms in an inbred strain of rats.,"In 10 subjects of a particular inbred strain of rats (WAG/Rij), two types of spike-wave complexes were detected in the cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) during the two recording hours. The first type, already well-known, occurred in 8 of the 10 rats. This type was seen both during sleep and wakefulness and was accompanied by behavioural concomitants, reminiscent of human petit-mal epilepsy. A mean of 18 discharges/h was found. The second type, a novel one with a differential shape, occurred in 7 rats with a mean number of 14 discharges/h. In contrast to the first one, this spike-wave complex was not accompanied by behavioural correlates and was almost exclusively present during wakefulness. Four reasons make this strain of rats attractive as an additional animal model for epileptogenic activity: the occurrence of two types of spike-wave complexes, the high percentage of animals showing these phenomena, the genetic constitution of these rats and the fact that they are commercially available.",Animal-other,5,1
470,20058555,Stapp car crash journal,A finite element model of region-specific response for mild diffuse brain injury.,"It is well known that rotational loading is responsible for a spectrum of diffuse brain injuries spanning from concussion to diffuse axonal trauma. Many experimental studies have been performed to understand the pathological and biomechanical factors associated with diffuse brain injuries. Finite element models have also been developed to correlate experimental findings with intrinsic variables such as strain. However, a paucity of studies exist examining the combined role of the strain-time parameter. Consequently, using the principles of finite element analysis, the present study introduced the concept of sustained maximum principal strain (SMPS) criterion and explored its potential applicability to diffuse brain injury. An algorithm was developed to determine if the principal strain in a finite element of the brain exceeded a specified magnitude over a specific time interval. The anatomical and geometrical details of the rat for the two-dimensional model were obtained from published data. Using material properties from literature and iterative techniques, the model was validated under three distinct rotational loading conditions indicative of non-injury, concussion, and diffuse axonal trauma. Validation results produced a set of material properties to define the model and were deemed appropriate to examine the role of sustained strain as an indicator of the mechanics of mild diffuse brain injury at the local level. Using a separate set of histological data obtained from graded mild diffuse brain injury experimental studies in rats, different formulations of SMPS criterion were evaluated. For the hippocampus and parietal cortex regions, 4-4 SMPS criterion was found to most closely match with the pattern of histological results. This was further verified by correlating the fractional areas to the time of unconsciousness for each animal group. Although not fully conclusive, these results are valuable in the understanding of diffuse brain injury pathologies following rotational loading.",Animal-other,5,1
471,15961528,"American journal of physiology. Regulatory, integrative and comparative physiology",Increased corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tone associated with partial bladder outlet obstruction is mediated via Rho-kinase.,"Numerous studies have now demonstrated that lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with erectile dysfunction (ED) in men independent of age or general health. Because one-third of men over the age of 50 will develop LUTS and a recent study showed ED in 62% of patients presenting for LUTS, the importance of determining the mechanistic link between these two pathologies is clear. Using a rabbit model of partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO), a primary cause of LUTS, we have identified an increased basal corpus cavernosum smooth muscle (CCSM) tone associated with an elevated level of smooth muscle myosin (SMM) phosphorylation in PBOO compared with sham-operated control rabbits (sham). Results from in vitro kinase and phosphatase assays using purified smooth muscle myosin showed increased kinase and decreased phosphatase activities in cellular extracts from corpora cavernosa isolated from PBOO compared with sham rabbits. Increased Rho-kinase expression in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits was suggested by the observations that Rho-kinase inhibitors attenuated the increased kinase activity and were less effective in relaxing CCSM strips from PBOO vs. sham rabbits. This hypothesis was then confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blotting, which demonstrated increased expression of both isoforms of Rho-kinase (ROKalpha and ROKbeta). Increased SMM basal phosphorylation (necessary for SM contraction) in the CCSM of PBOO rabbits, mediated via an increase in Rho-kinase expression/activity, would be expected to make the CCSM more difficult to relax (necessary for erection), which suggests that the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway as being involved in the mechanism for LUTS-associated ED.",Animal-other,5,1
472,29883458,PloS one,Sexual behavior and testis morphology in the BACHD rat model.,"Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder caused by a mutation in the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which results in brain neurodegeneration and peripheral pathology affecting different organs including testis. Patients with HD suffer from motor and cognitive impairment, and multiple psychiatric symptoms. Among behavioral abnormalities in HD, sexual disturbances have often been reported, but scarcely investigated in animal models. The BACHD rat model of HD carries the human full-length mutated HTT (mHTT) genomic sequence with 97 CAG-CAA repeats and displays HD-like alterations at neuropathological and behavioral level.	This study aims to phenotype the BACHD rats' sexual behavior and performance as well as testis morphology because alterations in these aspects have been associated to HD.	Two rat cohorts at the age of 3 and 7 months were subjected to mating tests to assess different parameters of sexual behavior. Histological analyses for testis morphology were performed in different rat cohorts at 1.5, 7 and 12 months of age whereas immunohistochemical analyses were carried out at 7 and 12 months of age to visualize the presence of mHTT in testicular tissue. Furthermore, western blot analyses were used to assess HTT and mHTT expression levels in striatum and testis at three months of age.	At 3 months, BACHD rats showed a decreased time exploring the female anogenital area (AGA), decreased latency to mount, increased number of intromissions and ejaculations and enhanced hit rate. At 7 months, all sexual parameters were comparable between genotypes with the exception that BACHD rats explored the AGA less than wild type rats. Testis analyses did not reveal any morphological alteration at any of the examined ages, but showed presence of mHTT limited to Sertoli cells in transgenic rats at both 7 and 12 months. BACHD rat HTT and mHTT expression levels in testis were lower than striatum at 3 months of age.	The testis phenotype in the BACHD rat model does not mimic the changes observed in human HD testis. The altered sexual behavior in BACHD rats at three months of age could be to a certain extent representative of and share common underlying pathways with some of the sexual disturbances in HD patients. Further investigating the biological causes of the sexual phenotype in BACHD rats may therefore contribute to clarifying the mechanisms at the base of sexual behavior changes in HD.",Animal-other,5,1

Purpose of this study was to investigate the dynamics of T2* changes in ischemic tissue.	We investigated earliest temporo-spatial dynamics within ischemic tissue, measured with quantitative T2* imaging in the histologically defined infarct core and surrounding surviving tissue. Middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was induced by a filament model in mice. Serial multiple gradient-echo T2* sequences and diffusion-weighted images were acquired for 60min after MCAO and repeated for 60min after recanalization. T2* maps were co-registered with histology and T2* changes were compared to the contralateral hemisphere.	Within the histologically defined infarct core, relative T2* values decreased significantly by -10.8±2.8% (P=0.003) compared to the contralateral hemisphere within 3.5±0.7min after MCAO. Relative T2* values in volume exceeding the histologically determined infarct core were significantly less decreased (-6.7±2.1%; P=0.02) and increased after recanalization (+3.9±1.9%; P=0.045). Volume with T2* decrease showed continuous growth over 60min after MCAO (P=0.002) and decreased during 60min after recanalization (P=0.026), showing most significant correlations between infarct core volume and T2* abnormality volume (r=0.66; P=0.037) of the last image acquired after recanalization.	To our best knowledge, this is the first application of non-invasive quantitative T2* measurements to assess changes in levels of deoxyhemoglobin as an indirect biomarker for metabolic impairment in ischemic tissue.	Quantitative T2* imaging might be a feasible tool to indicate change of oxygenation in acute stroke imaging, without administration of contrast agent.",Animal-other,5,1
474,29362445,Sci Rep,Abnormal behaviours relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders in Kirrel3-knockout mice,"In the nervous system, Kirrel3 is involved in neuronal migration, axonal fasciculation, and synapse formation. Recently, genetic links have been reported between mutations in the KIRREL3 gene and increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability. To elucidate the causal relationship between KIRREL3 deficiency and behavioural abnormalities relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders, we generated global Kirrel3-knockout (Kirrel3(-/-)) mice and investigated the detailed behavioural phenotypes. In the three-chambered social approach test, Kirrel3(-/-) mice displayed a significant preference for a mouse over a non-social object but no significant preference for a stranger mouse over a familiar mouse. Ultrasonic communications, including pup-to-mother calls, male-female courtship vocalisation and resident responses to intruder, were significantly impaired in Kirrel3(-/-) mice. Significant increases in locomotor activity and repetitive rearing were also observed in Kirrel3(-/-) mice. Furthermore, the performance of Kirrel3(-/-) mice in the rotarod test was significantly better than that of wild-type mice. In the acoustic startle test, Kirrel3(-/-) mice were significantly hypersensitive to acoustic stimuli. Anxiety-related behaviours and spatial or fear memory acquisition were normal in Kirrel3(-/-) mice. These findings suggest that Kirrel3(-/-) mice exhibit autistic-like behaviours, including social and communicative deficits, repetitive behaviours, and sensory abnormalities, as well as hyperactivity.",Animal-other,5,1
475,33541127,ASN Neuro,Sex Effect on Cardiac Damage in Mice With Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune disease of the central nervous system. Recent clinical study suggested that MS patient exhibited acute heart failure. Further, 12-lead electrocardiographic study showed a longer QTc interval in both MS patient and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) Lewis rat. However, there is limited study regarding the effect of sex on cardiac injury in EAE. To our knowledge, sex effect on cardiac damage in mice with EAE has not yet been published. Herein, we examined the role of the immune system in mediating cardiac dysfunction after EAE in female and male mice. Neurological function was subsequently evaluated and cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography at multiple time points after EAE. EAE mice exhibited severe neurological deficit and significant cardiac dysfunction, including decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fractional shortening (LVFS) at 1 and 2 months after EAE induction. Meanwhile male EAE presented increased expression of the oxidative stress (e.g., nicotinamaide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-2; NOX-2) in heart, as well as cardiac hypertrophy, increased left ventricle (LV) mass and more severe cardiac fibrosis compared with male control mice. In addition, male EAE mice showed significantly increased cardiac canonical inflammatory mediator (e.g., monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MCP-1, transforming growth factor-β; TGF-β and toll-like receptor 2; TLR-2) compared with female EAE mice at 2 months after EAE induction. In conclusion, EAE increases inflammatory factor expression and aggravates cardiac dysfunction in male mice compared with female mice, which may contribute to different cardiac outcome in EAE mice.",Animal-other,5,1

The mice and rats, considered as cerebral and ocular toxoplasmosis models, were intraperitoneally infected by different number of the parasite and their eyes and brain were evaluated for the presence of T. gondii cyst using the microscopic examination and the bioassay method. Moreover, the pregnant mice and rats, considered as congenital toxoplasmosis models, were intraperitoneally infected by different number of the parasite and their infants were examined by the method mentioned above. The best result for the cerebral toxoplasmosis model was observed in the rats infected with the 107 parasites, so that all infants (100%) were infected with the parasite when examined using the bioassay method. Furthermore, the best result was observed for the congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis model with 100% infection rate in the infants born to mothers infected with the 107 parasites. Overall, just few the ocular samples were positive using bioassay method. The best result in the current study was for the congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis model where the pregnant rats were infected with the 107 parasites and all infants were infected (100%). Therefore, these infants can be used as a congenital cerebral toxoplasmosis model when they are in the fetal stage, and can be used as a cerebral toxoplasmosis model one month after birth.",Animal-other,5,1
477,28368413,Oncogene,Co-amplification of phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer A and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 triggers glioblastoma progression.,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common primary brain tumor and has a dismal prognosis. Amplification of chromosome 12q13-q15 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) amplicon) is frequently observed in numerous human cancers including GBM. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase enhancer (PIKE) is a group of GTP-binding proteins that belong to the subgroup of centaurin GTPase family, encoded by CENTG1 located in CDK4 amplicon. However, the pathological significance of CDK4 amplicon in GBM formation remains incompletely understood. In the current study, we show that co-expression of PIKE-A and CDK4 in TP53/PTEN double knockout GBM mouse model additively shortens the latency of glioma onset and survival compared to overexpression of these genes alone. Consequently, p-mTOR, p-Akt and p-ERK pathways are highly upregulated in the brain tumors, in alignment with their oncogenic activities by CDK4 and PIKE-A stably transfected in GBM cell lines. Hence, our findings support that PIKE amplification or overexpression coordinately acts with CDK4 to drive GBM tumorigenesis.",Animal-other,5,1
478,24886495,BMC Complement Altern Med,Brain areas involved in the acupuncture treatment of AD model rats: a PET study,"BACKGROUND: Acupuncture may effectively treat certain symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several studies have used functional brain imaging to investigate the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment on AD, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. We therefore further explored the mechanism by which needling at ST36 may have a therapeutic effect in a rat AD model. METHODS: A total of 80 healthy Wistar rats were divided into healthy control (n = 15) and pre-model (n = 65) groups. After inducing AD-like disease, a total of 45 AD model rats were randomly divided into three groups: the model group (n = 15), the sham-point group (n = 15), and the ST36 group (n = 15). The above three groups underwent PET scanning. PET images were processed with SPM2. RESULTS: The brain areas that were activated in the sham-point group relative to the model group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system, the right frontal lobe, and the striatum, whereas the activated areas in the ST36 group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system (pyriform cortex), the bilateral temporal lobe (olfactory cortex), the right amygdala and the right hippocampus. Compared with the sham-point group, the ST36 group showed greater activation in the bilateral amygdalae and the left temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: We concluded that needling at a sham point or ST36 can increase blood perfusion and glycol metabolism in certain brain areas, and thus may have a positive influence on the cognition of AD patients.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

To address this, Tg mouse model of AD, Tg-NSE/PS2m, which expresses human mutant PS2 in the brain, was chosen. Animals were subjected to treadmill exercise for 12 weeks from 24 months of age. The exercised mice were treadmill run at speed of 12 m/min, 60 min/day, 5 days/week on a 0% gradient for 3 months. Treadmill exercised mice improved cognitive function in water maze test. Treadmill exercised mice significantly reduced the expression of Aβ-42, Cox-2, and caspase-3 in the hippocampus. In parallel, treadmill exercised Tg mice decreased the phosphorylation levels of JNK, p38MAPK and tau (Ser404, Ser202, Thr231), and increased the phosphorylation levels of ERK, PI3K, Akt and GSK-3α/β. In addition, treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expressions of NGF, BDNF and phospho-CREB, and the expressions of SOD-1, SOD-2 and HSP-70. Treadmill exercised Tg mice up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2, and down-regulated the expressions of cytochrome c and Bax in the hippocampus. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampus in mice was significantly decreased after treadmill exercise. Finally, serum TC, insulin, glucose, and corticosterone levels were significantly decreased in the Tg mice after treadmill exercise. As a consequence of such change, Aβ-dependent neuronal cell death in the hippocampus of Tg mice was markedly suppressed following treadmill exercise. These results strongly suggest that treadmill exercise provides a therapeutic potential to inhibit both Aβ-42 and neuronal death pathways. Therefore, treadmill exercise may be beneficial in prevention or treatment of AD.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
480,34077429,PLoS One,An enhanced therapeutic effect of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation combined with antibody treatment in a primate model of spinal cord injury,"Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the primary motor cortex (MI) is expected to provide a therapeutic impact on spinal cord injury (SCI). On the other hand, treatment with antibody against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) has been shown to ameliorate motor deficits after SCI in rodents and primates. Facilitating activity of the corticospinal tract (CST) by rTMS following rewiring of CST fibers by anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert an enhanced effect on motor recovery in a primate model of SCI. To address this issue, we examined whether such a combined therapeutic strategy could contribute to accelerating functional restoration from SCI. In our SCI model, unilateral lesions were made between the C6 and the C7 level. Two macaque monkeys were used for each of the combined therapy and antibody treatment alone, while one monkey was for rTMS alone. The antibody treatment was continuously carried out for four weeks immediately after SCI, and rTMS trials applying a thermoplastic mask and a laser distance meter lasted ten weeks. Behavioral assessment was performed over 14 weeks after SCI to investigate the extent to which motor functions were restored with the antibody treatment and/or rTMS. While rTMS without the preceding antibody treatment produced no discernible sign for functional recovery, a combination of the antibody and rTMS exhibited a greater effect, especially at an early stage of rTMS trials, on restoration of dexterous hand movements. The present results indicate that rTMS combined with anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert a synergistic effect on motor recovery from SCI.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

METHODS: The animals were divided into normal control group, EAE model group (EAE group), cell culture medium injection treatment group (placebo treatment group), and MSCs treatment group (treatment group). The changes of A2B5-, O4-, and CNPase-positive cells in oligodendrocyte lineage in rat brain were observed after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days.

The O4-positive cells number at each time point in the treatment group was significantly increased compared with the EAE and placebo treatment groups, and most obvious at 14 days. The CNPase-positive cells number at each time point in the treatment group was significantly increased compared with the EAE and placebo treatment groups, and most obvious at 14 days.

We assessed the impact of maternal hypertension, the most common medical disorder of pregnancy, on the anatomical and functional consequences of HI insult in the immature brain. Rat pups from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (Wistar Kyoto - WKY) dams were subjected to HI brain damage at post-natal day 7 (P7). Brain lesion and functional deficits were analyzed from 10 min to 35 days after HI, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sensorimotor and cognitive tests. MRI data revealed that SHR pups displayed less brain damage than WKY, attested by an initial smaller lesion followed by a reduced tissue loss at chronic stage (57.1±21.6 and 31.1±27% ipsilateral hemisphere atrophy in WKY and SHR, respectively). Behavioral analyses showed less HI-induced behavioral deficits in motor coordination (rotarod test) and spatial learning (Morris water maze test) in pups from hypertensive dams compared to those from normotensive ones. The data suggest that maternal hypertension causes prenatal stress that may render the immature brain more resistant to subsequent hypoxia-ischemia, related to a preconditioning phenomenon.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Despite enormous efforts around the world, there remains no effective cure for AD. This study was performed to investigate the effects of long-term exercise pretreatment on the typical pathology of AD in a novel transgenic AD rat model. Male 2-month-old animals were divided into the following groups: wild-type (WT) rats, AD rats, and AD rats with treadmill exercise pretreatment (AD-Exe). After exercise pretreatment, the Barnes maze task, passive avoidance task, and cued fear conditioning test were performed to test learning and memory function. The elevated plus maze, open field test, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test were conducted to measure anxious-depressive-like behavior. Immunofluorescence staining, Golgi staining, transmission electron microscopy, Western blot analysis, F-Jade C staining, TUNEL staining, and related assay kits were conducted to measure Aβ plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal damage, neuronal degeneration, dendritic spine density, synapses, synaptic vesicles, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial dynamic, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Behavioral tests revealed that long-term exercise pretreatment significantly alleviated learning and memory dysfunction and anxious-depressive-like behaviors in AD animals. In addition, exercise pretreatment attenuated amyloid-β deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and preserved spine density, synapses, and presynaptic vesicles. Exercise also inhibited neuronal damage, neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal degeneration. Additional studies revealed the imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics was significantly inhibited by exercise pretreatment accompanied by a remarkable suppression of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that long-term exercise pretreatment alleviated behavioral deficits and typical pathologies of the AD rat model, supporting long-term exercise pretreatment as a potential approach to delay the progression of AD.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Electrical stimulation of deep brain areas has been proposed as a novel neuromodulatory therapeutic approach. Previous research from our lab demonstrates that intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) targeting medial forebrain bundle (MFB) facilitates explicit and implicit learning and memory in rats with age or lesion-related memory impairment. At a molecular level, MFB-ICSS modulates the expression of plasticity and neuroprotection-related genes in memory-related brain areas. On this basis, we suggest that MFB could be a promising stimulation target for AD treatment. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of MFB-ICSS on both explicit memory as well as the levels of neuropathological markers ptau and drebrin (DBN) in memory-related areas, in an AD rat model obtained by Aβ icv-injection. A total of 36 male rats were trained in the Morris water maze on days 26-30 after Aβ injection and tested on day 33. Results demonstrate that this Aβ model displayed spatial memory impairment in the retention test, accompanied by changes in the levels of DBN and ptau in lateral entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, resembling pathological alterations in early AD. Administration of MFB-ICSS treatment consisting of 5 post-training sessions to AD rats managed to reverse the memory deficits as well as the alteration in ptau and DBN levels. Thus, this paper reports both cognitive and molecular effects of a post-training reinforcing deep brain stimulation procedure in a sporadic AD model for the first time.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

To this end, hMSCs were administered intravenously to APPPS1 transgenic mice that normally develop cerebral Aβ. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction biodistribution revealed that intravenously delivered hMSCs were readily detected in APPPS1 brains 1 hour following administration, and dropped to negligible levels after 1 week. Notably, intravenously injected hMSCs that migrated to the brain region were localized in the cerebrovasculature, but they also could be observed in the brain parenchyma particularly in the hippocampus, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. A single hMSC injection markedly reduced soluble cerebral Aβ levels in APPPS1 mice after 1 week, although increasing several Aβ-degrading enzymes and modulating a panel of cerebral cytokines, suggesting an amyloid-degrading and anti-inflammatory impact of hMSCs. Furthermore, 10 weeks of hMSC treatment significantly reduced cerebral Aβ plaques and neuroinflammation in APPPS1 mice, without increasing cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. Notably, a repeated intranasal delivery of soluble factors secreted by hMSCs in culture, in the absence of intravenous hMSC injection, was also sufficient to diminish cerebral amyloidosis in the mice. In conclusion, this preclinical study strongly underlines that cerebral amyloidosis is amenable to therapeutic intervention based on peripheral applications of hMSC or hMSC factors, paving the way for a novel therapy for Aβ amyloidosis and associated pathologies observed in AD.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
486,21099718,Neurosurgery,Predifferentiated brain-derived adult human progenitor cells migrate toward ischemia after transplantation to the adult rat brain.,"The adult human brain contains neural stem/progenitor cells (AHNPCs) that can survive transplantation into the adult rat brain, migrate toward a lesion, and display limited neuronal differentiation in vivo.	To investigate the effect of manipulating AHNPCs before grafting by predifferentiation, ie, initiating neuronal differentiation before transplantation, and to determine whether this cell priming would affect their ability to migrate in vivo.	AHNPCs were prepared from temporal lobe resections for epilepsy. Seven days after global brain ischemia, predifferentiated AHNPCs (exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor, heparin, and laminin) were transplanted to the left hippocampus. Four and 10 weeks after transplantation, brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry.	Transplanted primed cells expressed committed neuronal markers at a much earlier stage compared with nonprimed AHNPCs and were found colabeled with human markers within the damaged CA1 region 4 weeks after grafting. Furthermore, predifferentiated AHNPCs migrated preferentially into an ischemic lesion, similar to their undifferentiated counterparts. The chemoattractant effect from the expression of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) in ischemic CA1 on AHNPCs expressing CXC chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) may explain this preference in migration in vivo.	The plasticity of neural progenitors derived from the adult human brain may be greater than previously assumed in that manipulation before grafting may influence the phenotypes seen in vivo. The SDF-1α-CXCR4 axis is involved in the targeted migration toward an ischemic lesion in the adult rat brain, similar to previous reports on endogenous progenitors in rats and grafted fetal human neural progenitors.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
487,21316352,Brain Res,Whole body hypothermia broadens the therapeutic window of intranasally administered IGF-1 in a neonatal rat model of cerebral hypoxia-ischemia,"To investigate whether whole body hypothermia after neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) could broaden the therapeutic window of intranasal treatment of IGF-1 (iN-IGF-1), postnatal day 7 rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation, followed by 8% oxygen inhalation for 2h. After HI, one group of pups were returned to their dams and kept at room temperature (24.5±0.2°C). A second group of pups were subjected to whole body hypothermia in a cool environment (21.5±0.3°C) for 2 or 4h before being returned to their dams. Two doses of 50 μg recombinant human IGF-1 were administered intranasally at a 1h interval starting at 0, 2 or 4h after hypothermia. Hypothermia decreased the rectal temperature of pups by 4.5°C as compared to those kept at room temperature. While hypothermia or iN-IGF-1 administered 2h after HI alone did not provide neuroprotection, the combined treatment of hypothermia with iN-IGF-1 significantly protected the neonatal rat brain from HI injury. Hypothermia treatment extended the therapeutic window of IGF-1 to 6h after HI. The extended IGF-1 therapeutic window by hypothermia was associated with decreases in infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and activation of microglia/macrophages and with attenuation of NF-κB activation in the ipsilateral hemisphere following HI.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Anterograde tracing of descending CST axons revealed that TMT enhanced collateral arborization of CST axons surrounding the injury cavity and promoted extension into the caudal spinal cord. The number of oligodendrocytes in the vicinity of the injury cavity was significantly increased at 2 or 4 weeks after TMT compared to sedentary controls. The data further showed that TMT increased phosphorylation of Erk1/2 in the motor cortex as well as the spinal cord injury area, and inhibition of Erk1/2 activity by administration of the MEK1 inhibitors PD98059 and U0126 reduced collateral outgrowth of descending CST axons in TMT animals. TMT for 2-4 weeks significantly improved behavioral scores as assessed by the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan scale, as well as on motor function and gridwalk testing. Our data imply that Erk1/2 may be an important mediator for transmitting signals from the injury site to the cell body, and further suggest that activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway may be involved in enhanced outgrowth of CST axons after TMT.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
489,25447740,Neuron,Spinal cord stimulation alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of Parkinson disease,"Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
490,29790427,Stem cells and development,Simulated Microgravity Culture Enhances the Neuroprotective Effects of Human Cranial Bone-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Traumatic Brain Injury.,"Fundamental cures of central nervous system (CNS) diseases are rarely achieved due to the low regenerative ability of the CNS. Recently, cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) has been explored as an effective treatment for CNS diseases. Among the various tissue-derived MSCs, we have isolated human cranial bone-derived MSCs (cMSCs) in our laboratory. In addition, we have focused on simulated microgravity (MG) as a valuable culture environment of MSCs. However, detailed mechanisms underlying functional recovery from transplantation of MSCs cultured under MG conditions remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the therapeutic mechanisms of transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions in traumatic brain injury (TBI) model mice. Human cMSCs were cultured under 1G and MG conditions, and cMSCs cultured under MG conditions expressed significantly higher messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β). In TBI model mice, the transplantation of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions (group MG) showed greater motor functional improvement compared with only phosphate-buffered saline administration (group PBS). Moreover, the protein expression levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and the Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax)/b cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (Bcl-2) ratio were significantly lower at brain injury sites in mice of group MG than those of group PBS. In addition, an in vitro study showed that the conditioned medium of cMSCs cultured under MG conditions significantly suppressed the cell death of NG108-15 cells exposed to oxidative or inflammatory stress through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptosis effects. These findings demonstrate that culturing cMSCs under simulated MG increases the neuroprotective effects, suggesting that simulated MG cultures may be a useful method for cell-based therapy strategies for CNS diseases.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
491,34144146,"International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics",Modulation of Neuroinflammation by Low-Dose Radiation Therapy in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.,"Recently, several studies have reported that low-dose radiation therapy (RT) suppresses the release of proinflammatory cytokines in inflammatory-degenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD). AD is the most common cause of dementia, and neuroinflammation is one of the major contributing factors in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, low-dose RT may be used clinically for treating AD. However, the appropriate doses, effects, and underlying mechanisms of RT in AD have not been determined. In this study, we aimed to determine the appropriate RT dose and schedule for AD treatment and to investigate the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of low-dose RT in AD.	We first determined the proper dose and schedule for RT in late-stage AD using 8- to 9-month-old 5x Familial AD (5xFAD) mice, a well-known animal model of AD, by comparing the effects of a low total dose with low dose per fraction (LD-LDRT, 5 × 0.6 Gy) with those of a low moderate total dose with conventional dose per fraction (LMD-CDRT, 5 × 2 Gy).	LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT were found to reduce the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CD54, IL-3, CXCL9/10, and CCL2/4 in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Furthermore, increased microgliosis assessed using Iba-1 and CD68 dual immunostaining was significantly reduced by LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice. Moreover, LD-LDRT and LMD-CDRT decreased the amyloid plaque burden in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice and attenuated their cognitive impairment; these effects persisted for 4 to 5 weeks.	The present study showed that LD-LDRT alleviates cognitive impairments and prevents the accumulation of amyloid plaques by regulating neuroinflammation in the late stage of AD in 5xFAD mice, with an efficacy equivalent to that of LMD-CDRT. Furthermore, the findings suggest that compared with LMD-CDRT, LD-LDRT may facilitate accessible and convenient treatment in clinical trials.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1
492,19666100,J Ethnopharmacol,Withania somnifera root extract improves catecholamines and physiological abnormalities seen in a Parkinson's disease model mouse,"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera root extract (Ws)/Ashwagandha/Indian ginseng is a traditional herbal medicine, used over 4000 years in India, shown to have effect on neural growth and locomotor function. Although catecholamines and oxidative stress resulting in neurodegeneration and locomotor disorder are the main events in Parkinson's disease (PD), efficacy of the drug on these molecules and physiological abnormality are not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of the study was to examine effect of Ws on catecholamines and physiological abnormalities seen in PD using PD model mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 4 days to show biochemical and physiological abnormalities similar to patients with PD. PD mice were treated with Ws 100mg/kg body weight for 7 or 28 days. Catecholamines: dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA); antioxidants: glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx); and lipid peroxidation marker (TBARS) were analyzed in the Ws treated and untreated PD mouse striatum. RESULTS: Mouse treated with MPTP showed reduced levels of DA, DOPAC, HVA, GSH and GPx and induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) level compared to the control. Physiological abnormalities were seen in the mouse as determined by hang test and rotarod test. Oral treatment of PD mouse Ws root extract (100mg/kg body weight) for 7 days or 28 days increased DA, DOPAC and HVA levels and normalized TBARS levels in the corpus striatum of the PD mouse. The 7 days Ws treated mice showed improved motor function as determined by hang test and rotarod test. Treatment with Ws for 28 days increased GSH and GPx levels in the striatum compared to the Ws untreated PD mouse striatum. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Ws is a potential drug in treating catecholamines, oxidative damage and physiological abnormalities seen in the PD mouse.",Animal-non-drug-intervention,10,1

Measurements were obtained for 7 days before intervention (baseline) and for 2 weeks after the onset of treatment. METHODS: Alzheimer's disease patients with sleep disorders (n = 24) received 15-mg mirtazapine (n = 8) or placebo (n = 16) once daily at 2100 hours for 2 weeks. Patients were evaluated with actigraphy and structured scales before and after intervention. Historical control was employed. RESULTS: Treatment with mirtazapine or placebo had no effect on cognitive and functional status as assessed by the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Katz scale, respectively. There were no differences between groups in the frequency or severity of the adverse events reported. Compared with the placebo group, mirtazapine users showed increased daytime sleepiness but no improvement in the duration or efficiency of nocturnal sleep after treatment.

494,rayyan-1277757501,J Psychiatr Res,"An assessor-blinded, randomized comparison of efficacy and tolerability of switching from olanzapine to ziprasidone and the combination of both in schizophrenia spectrum disorders","BACKGROUND: Ziprasidone (ZIP) is often used with olanzapine (OLZ) in 'switch' and combination therapy but empirical evidence to support these strategies is limited. OBJECTIVE: This study was therefore designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of switching from OLZ to ZIP, the combination of both medications, and OLZ and ZIP monotherapy, in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). METHODS: In this 12 week open-label, assessor-blinded randomized trial, 148 patients with SSD who had not used antipsychotics for at least 3 months were assigned to ZIP (n = 49) or OLZ monotherapy (n = 31); OLZ for 4 weeks then a switch to ZIP (OLZ/ZIP, n = 35); or combination therapy (OLZ + ZIP, n = 33). The severity of psychosis and abnormal involuntary movements was evaluated at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks using standard instruments. Baseline-to-endpoint changes in weight gain and metabolic measures were compared. RESULTS: The efficacy of both OLZ/ZIP and OLZ + ZIP was comparable OLZ monotherapy and better than ZIP monotherapy in reducing overall psychotic and negative symptoms at most 8 and 12 week measurement points. Changes in weight gain, glucose, and lipid measures did not differ between OLZ/ZIP and OLZ + ZIP, but were markedly higher following OLZ monotherapy. The OLZ + ZIP group had the lowest overall incidence of adverse events and extrapyramidal symptoms of all the treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that combining ZIP and OLZ at the outset of treatment is superior to switching from OLZ to ZIP in terms of improving psychotic symptoms and limiting movement side effects without increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Patients (45-90 years of age) were randomized to placebo (n = 235), low-dose rivastigmine (1-4 mg/day, n = 233), or high-dose rivastigmine (6-12 mg/day, n = 231) for 26 weeks. Efficacy measures included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). For efficacy and safety analysis, patients were categorized by baseline Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score (MHIS) for the determination of VRF (MHIS > 0: presence of VRF; MHIS = 0: absence of VRF). As early as 12 weeks, the mean change from the baseline ADAS-Cog score was significantly different for those patients treated with high-dose rivastigmine compared with placebo controls in both MHIS categories. However, the treatment difference between high-dose rivastigmine and placebo at each time-point was larger for patients with MHIS > 0. The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the high-dose rivastigmine group for each level of improvement. No differences were noted between treatment groups regarding safety evaluations. Rivastigmine is effective in both categories of patients, and those with VRF experience greater clinical benefit (cognition, activities of daily living, and disease severity).",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial used these drugs to treat patients with probable, late onset Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (DSM V and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) exhibiting insomnia (DSM V criteria and nocturnal NPI scores ≥ 2). Actigraphic records were performed for 7 days at baseline and for 14 days during the treatment period in 62 patients aged 80.5 years in average and randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio for administration of zolpidem 10 mg/day, zopiclone 7.5 mg/day or placebo. Primary endpoint was the main nocturnal sleep duration (MNSD), whereas secondary outcomes were the proportion of the night time slept, awake time after sleep onset (WASO), nocturnal awakenings, total daytime sleep time and daytime naps. Cognitive and functional domains were tested before and after drug/placebo use. Three participants under zopiclone use had intervention interrupted due to intense daytime sedation and worsened agitation with wandering. Zopiclone produced an 81 min increase in MNSD (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8, 163.2), a 26 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -56.2, 4.8) and a 2-episode decrease in awakening per night (95% CI: -4.0, 0.4) in average compared to placebo. Zolpidem yielded no significant difference in MNSD despite a significant 22 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -52.5, 8.3) and a reduction of 1 awakening each night (95% CI: -3.4, 1.2) in relation to placebo. There was a 1-point reduction in mean performance in the symbols search test among zolpidem users (95% CI: -4.1, 1.5) and an almost eight-point reduction in average scores in the digit-symbol coding test among zopiclone users (95% CI: -21.7, 6.2). In summary, short-term use of zolpidem or zopiclone by older insomniacs with AD appears to be clinically helpful, even though safety and tolerance remain issues to be personalized in healthcare settings and further investigated in subsequent trials.

METHODS: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study involved 100 consecutive patients under 71 years old admitted to hospital for an acute ischaemic stroke; they were enrolled to receive 60 mg/day mianserin or placebo for 1 year. They were examined on admission, and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months with depression, stroke, and functional outcome scales. RESULTS: According to DSM-III-R, the prevalence of major depression was 6% at the initial stage, 11% at 1 year, and 16% at 18 months. At no time point did prevalences differ between the treatment groups, nor were differences found in depression scales, although at 2 months a greater improvement from initial assessment on the Hamilton depression scale was evident in patients on mianserin (p=0.05). Some beneficial changes on the Hamilton depression scale and Beck depression inventory were found in patients older than 56 (median age) and in men treated with mianserin, but not in other subgroups. Mianserin treatment did not affect stroke outcome as measured by neurological status, nor did it have any influence on functional outcome as measured by Rankin scale or Barthel index. CONCLUSION: It was not possible to show that early initiation of antidepressant therapy can prevent poststroke depression, because the prevalence of poststroke depression remained low even in patients on placebo. In this stroke population with a low rate of depressive patients, antidepressive medical treatment failed to affect stroke outcome.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

OBJECTIVES: The present report summarises the basis for selection of 16 mg/day as monotherapy as the optimal treatment regime and the design rationale of a confirmatory Phase 3 trial (LUCIDITY). DESIGN: The trial comprises a 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 12-month modified delayed-start open-label treatment phase. SETTING: 76 clinical research sites in North America and Europe. PARTICIPANTS: 545 patients with probable AD or MCI-AD in the final version of the protocol. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned randomly to receive hydromethylthione mesylate at doses of 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day or placebo at a 4:1:4 ratio during the double-blind phase. All participants in the open-label phase receive the 16 mg/day dose. MEASUREMENTS: Co-primary clinical outcomes are the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11) and the 23-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL23). Secondary biomarker measures include whole-brain atrophy and temporal lobe 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. RESULTS: 446 participants are expected to complete the 12-month placebo-controlled phase in March 2022. CONCLUSIONS: If the primary end points are met, the data will provide confirmatory evidence of the clinical and biomarker benefits of hydromethylthionine mesylate in minimal to moderate AD. As low-dose oral hydromethylthionine mesylate is simple to use clinically, does not cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and has a benign safety profile, it would likely improve AD management.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
500,29777529,Clinical pharmacokinetics,Pharmacokinetics of ADS-5102 (Amantadine) Extended Release Capsules Administered Once Daily at Bedtime for the Treatment of Dyskinesia.,"Preclinical and clinical studies suggest amantadine immediate-release (IR) may reduce dyskinesia in Parkinson's disease (PD), although higher doses are associated with increased CNS adverse events (AEs). ADS-5102 is an extended release amantadine capsule formulation, designed for once-daily dosing at bedtime (qhs) to provide high concentrations upon waking and throughout the day, with lower concentrations in the evening. The pharmacokinetics (PK) of ADS-5102 were assessed in two phase I studies in healthy subjects, and a blinded, randomized phase II/III dose-finding study in PD patients.	The first phase I study assessed single ADS-5102 doses (68.5, 137, and 274 mg) in a crossover design, whereas the second phase I study evaluated ADS-5102 137 mg for 7 days followed by amantadine IR 81 mg twice daily (or reverse order). In the phase II/III double-blind study, PD patients with dyskinesia were randomized to ADS-5102 (210, 274, or 338 mg) or placebo for 8 weeks.	Single ADS-5102 doses resulted in a slow initial rise in amantadine plasma concentration, with delayed time to maximum concentration (12-16 h). Amantadine plasma concentrations were higher in PD patients versus healthy volunteers. The steady-state profile of once-daily ADS-5102 was significantly different from that of twice-daily amantadine IR, such that the two formulations are not bioequivalent. PK modeling suggested the recommended daily ADS-5102 dosage (274 mg qhs) resulted in 1.4- to 2.0-fold higher amantadine plasma concentrations during the day versus amantadine IR.	ADS-5102 can be administered once-daily qhs to achieve high amantadine plasma concentrations in the morning and throughout the day, when symptoms of dyskinesia occur.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Anergic major depression most typically occurs in primary bipolar and in pseudounipolar affective illnesses. We hypothesized that tranylcypromine would be a highly effective and rapid treatment for depressions of this type. Results of repeated measures analyses of variance showed superiority of active drug over placebo by the end of the first week, and this improvement increased in significance at each successive visit. Improvement on tranylcypromine after week 1 was greater than that on placebo after week 6. Analysis of covariance of week 6 scores (corrected for week 0 scores) showed significantly greater improvement for tranylcypromine patients on all measures of depressive symptomatology. Tranylcypromine is a rapid, relatively safe, and dramatically effective treatment for anergic depression. Since 24 of 29 of the bipolar subjects had previously failed to respond to tricyclics and since bipolar depression is usually anergic, tranylcypromine should be compared to imipramine to determine the antidepressant of choice for manic-depressive illness.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

We aimed to investigate whether there was any evidence for the benefits of rivastigmine in patients with severe disease. These patients were compared with matched controls. In this study, 24 patients with advanced moderate AD received rivastigmine for 12 months. Another 20 patients received placebo. Mean daily doses of rivastigmine in the higher-dose group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 6.1 +/- 1.0, 8.3 +/- 1.2, 8.9 +/- 1.3, and 10.7 +/- 1.6 mg/day, respectively. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Forty-five percent of placebo-treated patients declined by at least 4 points on the ADAS-cog. Conversely, only 18.3% of patients treated with rivastigmine declined by 4 or more points. Functional disabilities, as assessed using the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale, remained significantly superior in rivastigmine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients.

Access to evidence-based treatments for opioid use disorders is extremely limited.	HIV Prevention Trials Network 058 (HPTN 058) was a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the impact of 2 medication-assisted treatment (MAT) strategies on HIV incidence or death among opioid-dependent people who inject drugs (PWID). HIV-negative opioid-dependent PWID were recruited from 4 communities in Thailand and China with historically high prevalence of HIV among PWID. A total of 1251 participants were randomly assigned to either (1) a 1-year intervention consisting of 2 opportunities for a 15-day detoxification with buprenorphine/naloxone (BUP/NX) combined with up to 21 sessions of behavioral drug and risk counseling [short-term medication-assisted treatment (ST-MAT)] or (2) thrice-weekly dosing for 48 weeks with BUP/NX and up to 21 counseling sessions [long-term medication-assisted treatment (LT-MAT)] followed by dose tapering. All participants were followed for 52 weeks after treatment completion to assess durability of impact.	Although the study was stopped early due to lower than expected occurrence of the primary end points, sufficient data were available to assess the impact of the interventions on drug use and injection-related risk behavior. At week 26, 22% of ST-MAT participants had negative urinalyses for opioids compared with 57% in the LT-MAT (P < 0.001). Differences disappeared in the year after treatment: at week 78, 35% in ST-MAT and 32% in the LT-MAT had negative urinalyses. Injection-related risk behaviors were significantly reduced in both groups after randomization.	Participants receiving BUP/NX 3 times weekly were more likely to reduce opioid injection while on active treatment. Both treatment strategies were considered safe and associated with reductions in injection-related risk behavior. These data support the use of thrice-weekly BUP/NX as a way to reduce exposure to HIV risk.

METHODS: This was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients (N = 130) meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for cocaine dependence and major depression or dysthymia (by SCID interview). Participants were treated with venlafaxine, up to 300 mg/day versus placebo. All patients received weekly individual manual-guided relapse prevention therapy. Weekly outcome measures included Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), self-reported cocaine use, urine toxicology and the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D). RESULTS: Mood response, defined as a 50% reduction in the Ham-D between randomization and end of study, was 41% (26/64) on venlafaxine, and 33% (22/66) on placebo (p = .39). Measures of depression (Ham-D and CGI) improved more rapidly on venlafaxine than placebo, but these differences disappeared by weeks 6-8. Cocaine outcomes did not differ between treatment groups, and the proportion of patients achieving three or more consecutive weeks of urine-confirmed abstinence was low (venlafaxine: 16%; placebo: 15%). Reduction in cocaine use was associated with mood response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, venlafaxine was not superior to placebo on either mood or cocaine use outcomes. Mood improvement was associated with improvement in cocaine use. However, placebo mood response was only moderate, and the proportion of patients achieving sustained abstinence was low. This suggests that the subgroup of cocaine-dependent patients with depressive disorders is relatively treatment resistant, and that further research is needed to improve outcomes for these patients.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
507,31667735,"American journal of cardiovascular drugs : drugs, devices, and other interventions",Bioequivalence of a Newly Developed Dabigatran Etexilate Tablet Versus the Commercial Capsule and Impact of Rabeprazole-Induced Elevated Gastric pH on Exposure in Healthy Subjects.,"Dabigatran etexilate (DE) is an anticoagulant with proven efficacy and tolerability for stroke prevention in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. For the commercial capsule, a complex formulation is used to maintain the acidic microenvironment required for maximal absorption. Consequently, its efficacy and safety are similar with or without concomitant intake of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). A simplified DE tablet formulation was developed and tested in two studies. One investigated bioequivalence (BE) of the novel DE tablet versus the commercial DE capsule. The other investigated DE bioavailability (BA) under pretreatment with the PPI rabeprazole and assessed the effect of elevated pH on exposure to dabigatran.	BE of the novel DE tablet versus the DE capsule was assessed in a randomized two-treatment, four-period, two-sequence crossover study (NCT03070171). The effect of rabeprazole on the BA of the DE tablet was assessed in an open-label, single-arm study (NCT03143166). Both studies were conducted at sites in Japan. Participants were healthy male volunteers, aged ≥ 20-40 years. In the BE study, participants received the DE tablet or capsule (single oral dose, 110 mg); primary endpoints were area under the concentration-time curve from baseline to the last quantifiable data point (AUC0-tz) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of unconjugated dabigatran. In the relative BA study, participants received the DE tablet (single oral dose, 110 mg) with or without rabeprazole pretreatment (once daily for 5 days, 20 mg); primary endpoints were AUC0-tz and Cmax of total dabigatran.	In total, 160 participants were randomized in the BE study; 36 participants were enrolled in the BA study. The 90% confidence intervals of geometric mean (gMean) ratios for AUC0-tz (101.4-116.0%) and Cmax (101.8-116.6%) of unconjugated dabigatran were within pre-defined acceptance criteria for BE. In the relative BA study, the gMeans of AUC0-tz (667 to 192 ng h/mL) and Cmax (83.1 to 21.8 ng/mL) were decreased by approximately 70% when the tablet was administered under rabeprazole pretreatment. The reduction in BA was observed at a mean gastric pH of 5.3. Treatment was well tolerated; no deaths, serious adverse events (AEs) or significant AEs were reported in either study.	The DE tablet demonstrated BE to the capsule; however, at high gastric pH, BA of the tablet was reduced by approximately 70%, which may lead to reduced efficacy. Data indicate the importance of examining not only BE under standard conditions, but relative BA at elevated gastric pH. Such investigations may avoid the reduced BA at elevated pH that is quite common in the target population (the elderly and/or patients treated with gastric-acid modifying co-medications), and therefore reduce treatment failure with DE.

As risk factors for eating disorders are partly associated with overweight and overweight in turn is correlated to disordered eating, this study will offer a combined eating disorder prevention program which also promotes a balanced lifestyle to normal weight and overweight individuals alike. The efficacy of the program has been proven in previous trials. The study aims to evaluate the dissemination of a combined eating disorder prevention and health promotion program (everyBody) to women of all age groups and varying levels of ED risk status in the general population. METHODS: A dissemination trial will be conducted in German-speaking countries, including 4160 women from the general population. Participants will be screened to exclude participants who are likely to have an ED. Eligible participants will be allocated to one of five program arms based on their BMI and respective ED symptoms. The guided program consists of 4 to 12 weeks of weekly sessions offering CBT-based exercises, psychoeducational material, self-monitoring, and group discussions. Outcomes will be assessed according to the RE-AIM model, including measures of effectiveness, reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the program. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This trial aims to disseminate a combined ED prevention and health promotion program in the general population, offering universal, selective and indicated prevention in one program. To our knowledge, it is the first trial to systematically evaluate dissemination efforts based on the RE-AIM model.

The aim of the study is to outline the study protocol of a trial to test the efficacy of a mobile coach based intervention for the prevention of childhood drowning. METHOD/DESIGN: A two-arm cluster randomized community trial will be conducted to test the efficacy of the mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning on parents with children below five years of age and compared to an assessment only control group. A total of 1680 parents in the villages with children aged below five years of age will participate. The village will be used as a randomized unit, randomly assigned to an intervention group (N = 840) receiving the mobile coach based intervention or an assessment only control group (N = 840). An individualized mobile coach intervention based on the demographic data and the individual will be developed, and SMSs, audio messages, videos and images about childhood drowning will be sent to the participants of the intervention group over a period of six months. The participants will receive per week one text message (SMS) and image and one video and audio text per month. The primary outcome measure will be increased knowledge and safety awareness, and behaviour practice about childhood drowning assessed at the six-month follow-up, and the secondary outcome measure will be the reduced incidence of childhood drowning in Bangladesh. The study assistants conducting the baseline and the follow-up assessments will be blinded regarding the group assignment. DISCUSSION: This is the first study testing a fully mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning prevention in Bangladesh. It is hoped that the programme will offer an effective and inexpensive way to prevent childhood drowning among children aged below five years and also increase the awareness of parents concerning the risks to their children from drowning.

510,rayyan-1270389354,Trials,Cornerstone program for transition-age youth with serious mental illness: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Transition-age youth have elevated rates of mental disorders, and they often do not receive services. This is a serious public health concern, as mental health conditions persist into adulthood. Continuing to engage this population has been a pervasive challenge for the mental health care system worldwide. Few mental health interventions have been developed for transition-age youth, and even fewer have been found to be effective over the transition to adulthood. Cornerstone, a theoretically guided intervention has shown promise for addressing the mental health and psychosocial needs of this population as they emerge into adulthood. Cornerstone provides case management, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, mentoring/peer support, community-based in vivo practice, and groups to address stigma, mistrust, and practical skill development to improve the transition to independence among transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions. METHODS/DESIGN: This study utilizes a hybrid research design and focuses on examining feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact, along with factors that influence implementation, to maximize new knowledge. The study combines qualitative methods and a randomized controlled trial, using data to inform and refine protocols and manuals, while testing the preliminary impact of the intervention, compared to best available services (treatment as usual, TAU) at a partnering outpatient mental health clinic (n = 60). Contributors to the intervention development research (n = 20) are national experts on mental health services, clinic administrators and staff and young adults with direct experience. The intervention involves intensive staff training and 18 months of ongoing service provision, monitoring and supervision. Quantitative survey data will be collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months measuring mental health and practical life outcomes via self-report measures. Medical records will be used to triangulate self-report data (i.e., primary diagnosis, treatment planning and attendance). Qualitative data focuses on the intervention development process and implementation research and will use constant comparison coding techniques. In this intention-to-treat analysis, we will conduct basic omnibus analyses to examine whether Cornerstone leads to improved outcomes relative to TAU utilizing t tests across treatment conditions for each outcome measure specified. We will likewise examine whether changes in the proposed mediating variables differ across groups. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to refine Cornerstone through an intensive preliminary trial, learning through collaboration with clinic staff, project team members, and leaders in New York State and nationwide on how to best serve transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions. Cornerstone has the potential to fill a large gap in the service system for transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions, and may enhance the menu of care options for those who have been recently diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, and yet, have a long life to live. The program is recovery-oriented, builds on the best evidence to date, and is in line with both local and national health care reform efforts.

However, there is no suitable intervention for it. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies have shown its therapeutic efficacy in treatment resistant patients with stress-related disorders. Here we describe an exploratory study protocol to investigate the effect of the intervention for the individuals with high level of stress. METHOD: This is a single blinded, randomized sham-controlled trial, targeting at young healthy adults aging from 18 to 24 years old. Forty eligible volunteers will be recruited and randomly divided into active and sham rTMS group. All subjects will take a set of neuropsychological and biological assessments and MRI scanning before and right after the intervention. During the interventional period, 12-session stimulations will be performed in 4 weeks with three sessions per week. The primary outcome will detect the difference of Chinese 14-item perceived stress scales between active and sham rTMS groups after intervention. Secondary outcomes will examine the differences of other affective measurements, level of cortisol, and MRI-derived neural functional measures between the two groups after intervention. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to examine the effect of the 12-session rTMS intervention on individuals with high level of perceived stress. Positive or negative findings from any of the outcome measures would further our understanding of the efficacy of the stimulation and its neural impact. If effective, it would provide an evidence for a new treatment for high perceived stress. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR1900027662 ). Registered on 23 November 2019.

In community-based samples, 2-4% of women and 1-3% men are diagnosed with BED. Psychotherapeutic interventions focusing on maintenance factors of disturbed eating behavior have proven to be effective. However, treatment access is limited for a considerable number of patients with BED. A lack of specialized institutions and treatment resources, but also long distances to treatment facilities for people living in remote or rural areas are often causes of insufficient care. Internet-based guided self-help (GSH) programs have the potential to fill this gap. METHODS: This project aims to develop and evaluate an Internet-based treatment for BED derived from an evidence-based manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The primary goal is to test feasibility and suitability of the Internet-based program and to evaluate the treatment outcome in comparison to a pure and a placebo-inspired waitlist control group (i.e. reduction of binge-eating episodes and eating disorder pathology as primary outcome variables). In total, 60 women and men aged 18-70 years with a BED diagnosis will be recruited. The Internet-based GSH treatment comprises eight sessions followed by three booster sessions. The placebo-inspired waitlist control group receives weekly messages containing information increasing positive expectations regarding the treatment effects during the four-week waiting period. The pure waitlist control group receives weekly messages simply asking patients to fill in a short questionnaire. DISCUSSION: The access to evidence-based treatments for BED might be made easier using an Internet-based GSH approach. The present study protocol presents a randomized controlled trial. As well as evaluating the suitability and efficacy of the Internet-based GSH treatment, there will also be a prelimarily investigation on the influence of positive expectations (placebo) for a therapeutic intervention on core symptoms.

514,rayyan-1270387305,BMC Geriatr,A water-based training program that include perturbation exercises to improve stepping responses in older adults: study protocol for a randomized controlled cross-over trial,"BACKGROUND: Gait and balance impairments may increase the risk of falls, the leading cause of accidental death in the elderly population. Fall-related injuries constitute a serious public health problem associated with high costs for society as well as human suffering. A rapid step is the most important protective postural strategy, acting to recover equilibrium and prevent a fall from initiating. It can arise from large perturbations, but also frequently as a consequence of volitional movements. We propose to use a novel water-based training program which includes specific perturbation exercises that will target the stepping responses that could potentially have a profound effect in reducing risk of falling. We describe the water-based balance training program and a study protocol to evaluate its efficacy (Trial registration number #NCT00708136). METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed water-based training program involves use of unpredictable, multi-directional perturbations in a group setting to evoke compensatory and volitional stepping responses. Perturbations are made by pushing slightly the subjects and by water turbulence, in 24 training sessions conducted over 12 weeks. Concurrent cognitive tasks during movement tasks are included. Principles of physical training and exercise including awareness, continuity, motivation, overload, periodicity, progression and specificity were used in the development of this novel program. Specific goals are to increase the speed of stepping responses and improve the postural control mechanism and physical functioning. A prospective, randomized, cross-over trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of the water-based training program. A total of 36 community-dwelling adults (age 65-88) with no recent history of instability or falling will be assigned to either the perturbation-based training or a control group (no training). Voluntary step reaction times and postural stability using stabiliogram diffusion analysis will be tested before and after the 12 weeks of training. DISCUSSION: This study will determine whether a water-based balance training program that includes perturbation exercises, in a group setting, can improve speed of voluntary stepping responses and improve balance control. Results will help guide the development of more cost-effective interventions that can prevent the occurrence of falls in the elderly.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
515,rayyan-1270388864,BMC Psychiatry,Narrative exposure therapy for immigrant children traumatized by war: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of effectiveness and mechanisms of change,"BACKGROUND: Millions of children worldwide suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and other mental health problems due to repeated exposure to war or organized violence. Forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are the most commonly used treatment for PTSD and appear to be effective for children as well, but little is known about the mechanisms of change through which they achieve their effectiveness. Here we present the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) studying the effectiveness and mechanisms of change of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), a CBT-based, manualized, short-term intervention for PTSD symptoms resulting from repeated traumatization, in immigrant children traumatized by war. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a multicentre, pragmatic RCT in a usual care setting. Up to 80 9-17-year-old immigrant children who have experienced war and suffer from PTSD symptoms will be randomized into intervention (NET) and control (treatment as usual, TAU) groups of equal sizes. The effectiveness of NET treatment will be compared to both a waiting list and the parallel TAU positive control group, on the primary outcomes of PTSD and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, resilience, and level of cognitive performance. The effects of the intervention on traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions will be studied as potential mechanisms of change mediating overall treatment effectiveness. The possible moderating effects of peritraumatic dissociation, level of cognitive performance, and gender on treatment effectiveness will also be considered. We hypothesize that NET will be more effective than a waitlist condition or TAU in reducing PTSD and other symptoms and improving resilience, and that these effects will be mediated by changes in traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of NET in treating trauma-related symptoms in immigrant children affected by war. The trial will also generate insights into the complex relationships between PTSD, memory functions, posttraumatic cognitions and cognitive performance in children, and help guide the future development and implementation of therapeutic interventions for PTSD in children.

Fragmentation of care, inadequate pain communication, and reluctance towards pain medication contribute to difficulties in optimizing outcomes. Integration of patient self-management and professional care by means of healthcare technology provides new opportunities in the outpatient setting. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol outlines a two-armed multicenter randomized controlled trial that compares a technology based multicomponent self-management support intervention with care as usual and includes an effect, economic and process evaluation. Patients will be recruited consecutively via the outpatient oncology clinics and inpatient oncology wards of one academic hospital and one regional hospital in the south of the Netherlands. Irrespective of the stage of disease, patients are eligible when they are diagnosed with cancer and have uncontrolled moderate to severe cancer (treatment) related pain defined as NRS≥4 for more than two weeks. Randomization (1:1) will assign patients to either the intervention or control group; patients in the intervention group receive self-management support and patients in the control group receive care as usual. The intervention will be delivered by registered nurses specialized in pain and palliative care. Important components include monitoring of pain, adverse effects and medication as well as graphical feedback, education, and nurse support. Effect measurements for both groups will be carried out with questionnaires at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1) and after 12 weeks (T2). Pain intensity and quality of life are the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, knowledge, anxiety, depression and pain medication use. The final questionnaire contains also questions for the economic evaluation that includes both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Data for the process evaluation will be gathered continuously over the study period and focus on recruitment, reach, dose delivered and dose received. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will provide insight into the effectiveness of the self-management support intervention delivered by nurses to outpatients with uncontrolled cancer pain. Study findings will be used to empower patients and health professionals to improve cancer pain control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02333968 December 29, 2014.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
517,rayyan-1270388816,BMC Complement Altern Med,A randomised controlled trial: can acupuncture reduce drug requirement during analgosedation with propofol and alfentanil for colonoscopy? A study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The number of colonoscopies tremendously increased in recent years and will further rise in the near future. Because of patients' growing expectation on comfort during medical procedures, it is not surprising that the demand for sedation also expands. Propofol in combination with alfentanil is known to provide excellent analgosedation, however, its use is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Acupuncture could be a technique to reduce drug requirement while providing the same level of sedation and analgesia. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be performed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 153 patients scheduled for propofol/alfentanil sedation during colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture (P6, ST36, LI4), sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SpO2, ECG, NIBP, exCO2, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. The primary outcome parameter is the dosage of propofol necessary for an adequate level of sedation to tolerate the procedure (OAA/S < 4). Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels measured by questionnaires is the secondary outcome parameter. DISCUSSION: Moderate to deep sedation using propofol is increasingly applied during colonoscopies with a high satisfaction level among patients despite well-known hemodynamic and respiratory side effects of this hypnotic agent. Acupuncture is known to attenuate gastrointestinal discomfort and pain. We hypothesize that the combination of conventional sedation techniques with acupuncture may result in equally satisfied patients with a lower risk of respiratory and hemodynamic events during colonoscopies.

Its chronic course is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, a high risk of suicide and poor social and occupational outcomes. Despite the great advances over the last decades in understanding mental disorders, the mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder at the neural network level still remain elusive. This has severe consequences for clinical practice, for instance by inadequate diagnoses or delayed treatments. The German research consortium BipoLife aims to shed light on the mechanisms underlying bipolar disorders. It was established in 2015 and incorporates ten university hospitals across Germany. Its research projects focus in particular on individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder, young patients in the early stages of the disease and patients with an unstable highly relapsing course and/or with acute suicidal ideation. METHODS: Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was acquired across nine sites within three different studies. Obtaining neuroimaging data in a multicenter setting requires among others the harmonization of the acquisition protocol, the standardization of paradigms and the implementation of regular quality control procedures. The present article outlines the MRI imaging protocols, the acquisition parameters, the imaging paradigms, the neuroimaging quality assessment procedures and the number of recruited subjects. DISCUSSION: The careful implementation of a MRI study protocol as well as the adherence to well-defined quality assessment procedures is one key benchmark in the evaluation of the overall quality of large-scale multicenter imaging studies.

520,rayyan-1277759655,JAMA Neurol,Clinical Effect of Early vs Late Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography in Memory Clinic Patients: The AMYPAD-DPMS Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) allows the direct assessment of amyloid deposition, one of the main hallmarks of Alzheimer disease. However, this technique is currently not widely reimbursed because of the lack of appropriately designed studies demonstrating its clinical effect. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effect of amyloid PET in memory clinic patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The AMYPAD-DPMS is a prospective randomized clinical trial in 8 European memory clinics. Participants were allocated (using a minimization method) to 3 study groups based on the performance of amyloid PET: arm 1, early in the diagnostic workup (within 1 month); arm 2, late in the diagnostic workup (after a mean [SD] 8 [2] months); or arm 3, if and when the managing physician chose. Participants were patients with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD+; SCD plus clinical features increasing the likelihood of preclinical Alzheimer disease), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia; they were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Recruitment took place between April 16, 2018, and October 30, 2020. Data analysis was performed from July 2022 to January 2023. INTERVENTION: Amyloid PET. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The main outcome was the difference between arm 1 and arm 2 in the proportion of participants receiving an etiological diagnosis with a very high confidence (ie, ≥90% on a 50%-100% visual numeric scale) after 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 844 participants were screened, and 840 were enrolled (291 in arm 1, 271 in arm 2, 278 in arm 3). Baseline and 3-month visit data were available for 272 participants in arm 1 and 260 in arm 2 (median [IQR] age: 71 [65-77] and 71 [65-77] years; 150/272 male [55%] and 135/260 male [52%]; 122/272 female [45%] and 125/260 female [48%]; median [IQR] education: 12 [10-15] and 13 [10-16] years, respectively). After 3 months, 109 of 272 participants (40%) in arm 1 had a diagnosis with very high confidence vs 30 of 260 (11%) in arm 2 (P < .001). This was consistent across cognitive stages (SCD+: 25/84 [30%] vs 5/78 [6%]; P < .001; MCI: 45/108 [42%] vs 9/102 [9%]; P < .001; dementia: 39/80 [49%] vs 16/80 [20%]; P < .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, early amyloid PET allowed memory clinic patients to receive an etiological diagnosis with very high confidence after only 3 months compared with patients who had not undergone amyloid PET. These findings support the implementation of amyloid PET early in the diagnostic workup of memory clinic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2017-002527-21.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
521,36443882,Trials,Comparison of intermittent screening (using ultra-sensitive malaria rapid diagnostic test) and treatment (using a newly registered antimalarial pyronaridine-artesunate-PYRAMAX®) to standard intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for the prevention of malaria in pregnant women living in endemic areas: ULTRAPYRAPREG,"BACKGROUND: Intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is an important malaria control strategy in sub-Saharan Africa. Indeed, it overcomes the risk of misdiagnosis due to low peripheral parasitemia during pregnancy by treating women with SP on predetermined schedules. However, over time, the spread of Plasmodium-resistant strains has threatened this strategy in many countries. As an alternative, the intermittent screening and treatment for pregnancy (ISTp) aims at a monthly screening of pregnant women, preferably by using very sensitive tests such as ultrasensitive rapid diagnostic tests (us-RDTs) and the treatment of positive cases with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) regardless of the presence of symptoms. Unlike IPTp-SP, ISTp prevents overuse of antimalarials limiting the drug pressure on parasites, an advantage which can be potentiated by using an ACT like pyronaridine-artesunate (Pyramax®) that is not yet used in pregnant women in the field. METHODS: This study aims to compare the non-inferiority of ISTp using us-RDTs and Pyramax® versus IPTp-SP on malaria in pregnancy through a randomized clinical trial performed in Kisenso, Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a malaria perennial transmission area. DISCUSSION: The results will be essential for the National Malaria Control Program to update the malaria prevention policy in pregnant women in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

522,29790072,J Gen Intern Med,Effect of Social Comparison Feedback on Laboratory Test Ordering for Hospitalized Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Social comparison feedback is an increasingly popular strategy that uses performance report cards to modify physician behavior. Our objective was to test the effect of such feedback on the ordering of routine laboratory tests for hospitalized patients, a practice considered overused. METHODS: This was a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. Between January and June 2016, physicians on six general medicine teams at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were cluster randomized with equal allocation to two arms: (1) those e-mailed a summary of their routine laboratory test ordering vs. the service average for the prior week, linked to a continuously updated personalized dashboard containing patient-level details, and snapshot of the dashboard and (2) those who did not receive the intervention. The primary outcome was the count of routine laboratory test orders placed by a physician per patient-day. We modeled the count of orders by each physician per patient-day after the intervention as a function of trial arm and the physician's order count before the intervention. The count outcome was modeled using negative binomial models with adjustment for clustering within teams. RESULTS: One hundred and fourteen interns and residents participated. We did not observe a statistically significant difference in adjusted reduction in routine laboratory ordering between the intervention and control physicians (physicians in the intervention group ordered 0.14 fewer tests per patient-day than physicians in the control group, 95% CI - 0.56 to 0.27, p = 0.50). Physicians whose absolute ordering rate deviated from the peer rate by more than 1.0 laboratory test per patient-day reduced their laboratory ordering by 0.80 orders per patient-day (95% CI - 1.58 to - 0.02, p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Personalized social comparison feedback on routine laboratory ordering did not change targeted behavior among physicians, although there was a significant decrease in orders among participants who deviated more from the peer rate.

523,31578808,Health Expect,An exploration of women's experience of taking part in a randomized controlled trial of a diagnostic test during pregnancy: A qualitative study,"OBJECTIVE: To explore pregnant women's views of participation in a clinical research trial while pregnant. DESIGN: Prospective nested qualitative cohort study embedded within a national, multi-site randomized controlled trial of a diagnostic test for preeclampsia: Placental Growth Factor. One-to-one in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 19 women who had recently participated in the trial at a single recruiting site. The interviews were conducted in private, recorded digitally and transcribed verbatim. SETTING: Single tertiary maternity hospital currently recruiting eligible women onto an on-going randomized controlled trial (NCT02881073). PARTICIPANTS: Women who had participated in the PARROT Ireland randomized controlled trial during their recent pregnancy. METHODS: Thematic analysis was utilized. Each line of the transcribed interviews was coded into a category by two researchers. The resultant categories were reviewed, and those with similarities were pooled allowing the development of themes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Women's opinions and experience of participation in a randomized controlled trial of an interventional diagnostic test during their pregnancy. RESULTS: Four major themes were identified as follows: (a) Understanding of preeclampsia, (b) Motivators for clinical trial participation, (c) Barriers to decision making and (d) Influence of PARROT Ireland on pregnancy experience. CONCLUSIONS: Women are generally interested and positively inclined to participate in research during pregnancy. The potential of risk is an important consideration for eligible pregnant woman. Information and support by both researchers and clinicians are paramount in aiding women's understanding of a research trial.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
524,32530426,Lancet Infect Dis,Pay-it-forward gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among men who have sex with men in China: a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: WHO recommends that men who have sex with men (MSM) receive gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing, but many evidence-based preventive services are unaffordable. The pay-it-forward strategy offers an individual a gift (eg, a test for sexually transmitted diseases) and then asks whether they would like to give a gift (eg, a future test) to another person. This study examined the effectiveness of a pay-it-forward programme to increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing among MSM in China. METHODS: We did a randomised controlled superiority trial at three HIV testing sites run by MSM community-based organisations in Guangzhou and Beijing, China. We included MSM aged 16 years or older who were seeking HIV testing and met indications for gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing. Restricted randomisation was done using computer-generated permuted blocks. 30 groups were randomised into three arms (1:1:1): a pay-it-forward arm in which men were offered free gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing and then asked whether they would like to donate for testing of prospective participants, a pay-what-you-want arm in which men were offered free testing and given the option to pay any desired amount for the test, and a standard-of-care arm in which testing was offered at ¥150 (US$22). There was no masking to arm assignment. The primary outcome was gonorrhoea and chlamydia test uptake ascertained by administrative records. We used generalised estimating equations to estimate intervention effects with one-sided 95% CIs and a prespecified superiority margin of 20%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03741725. FINDINGS: Between Dec 8, 2018, and Jan 19, 2019, 301 men were recruited and included in the analysis. 101 were randomly assigned to the pay-it-forward group, 100 to the pay-what-you-want group, and 100 to the standard-of-care group. Test uptake for gonorrhoea and chlamydia was 56% (57 of 101 participants) in the pay-it-forward arm, 46% (46 of 100 participants) in the pay-what-you-want arm, and 18% (18 of 100 participants) in the standard-of-care arm. The estimated difference in test uptake between the pay-it-forward and standard-of-care group was 38·4% (95% CI lower bound 28·4%). Among men in the pay-it-forward arm, 54 of 57 (95%) chose to donate to support testing for others. INTERPRETATION: The pay-it-forward strategy can increase gonorrhoea and chlamydia testing uptake among Chinese MSM and could be a useful tool for scaling up preventive services that carry a mandatory fee.

525,31337404,BMC Med,Delirium detection in older acute medical inpatients: a multicentre prospective comparative diagnostic test accuracy study of the 4AT and the confusion assessment method,"BACKGROUND: Delirium affects > 15% of hospitalised patients but is grossly underdetected, contributing to poor care. The 4 'A's Test (4AT, www.the4AT.com ) is a short delirium assessment tool designed for routine use without special training. The primary objective was to assess the accuracy of the 4AT for delirium detection. The secondary objective was to compare the 4AT with another commonly used delirium assessment tool, the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM). METHODS: This was a prospective diagnostic test accuracy study set in emergency departments or acute medical wards involving acute medical patients aged ≥ 70. All those without acutely life-threatening illness or coma were eligible. Patients underwent (1) reference standard delirium assessment based on DSM-IV criteria and (2) were randomised to either the index test (4AT, scores 0-12; prespecified score of > 3 considered positive) or the comparator (CAM; scored positive or negative), in a random order, using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers, stratified by study site, with block allocation. Reference standard and 4AT or CAM assessments were performed by pairs of independent raters blinded to the results of the other assessment. RESULTS: Eight hundred forty-three individuals were randomised: 21 withdrew, 3 lost contact, 32 indeterminate diagnosis, 2 missing outcome, and 785 were included in the analysis. Mean age was 81.4 (SD 6.4) years. 12.1% (95/785) had delirium by reference standard assessment, 14.3% (56/392) by 4AT, and 4.7% (18/384) by CAM. The 4AT had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.96). The 4AT had a sensitivity of 76% (95% CI 61-87%) and a specificity of 94% (95% CI 92-97%). The CAM had a sensitivity of 40% (95% CI 26-57%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI 98-100%). CONCLUSIONS: The 4AT is a short, pragmatic tool which can help improving detection rates of delirium in routine clinical care.

526,rayyan-1277757078,Neurology,Evolution of clinical features in possible DLB depending on FP-CIT SPECT result,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that core and suggestive features in possible dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) would vary in their ability to predict an abnormal dopamine transporter scan and therefore a follow-up diagnosis of probable DLB. A further objective was to assess the evolution of core and suggestive features in patients with possible DLB over time depending on the (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT scan result. METHODS: A total of 187 patients with possible DLB (dementia plus one core or one suggestive feature) were randomized to have dopamine transporter imaging or to follow-up without scan. DLB features were compared at baseline and at 6-month follow-up according to imaging results and follow-up diagnosis. RESULTS: For the whole cohort, the baseline frequency of parkinsonism was 30%, fluctuations 29%, visual hallucinations 24%, and REM sleep behavior disorder 17%. Clinician-rated presence of parkinsonism at baseline was significantly (p = 0.001) more frequent and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score at baseline was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in patients with abnormal imaging. There was a significant increase in UPDRS score in the abnormal scan group over time (p < 0.01). There was relatively little evolution of the rest of the DLB features regardless of the imaging result. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with possible DLB, apart from UPDRS score, there was no difference in the evolution of DLB clinical features over 6 months between cases with normal and abnormal imaging. Only parkinsonism and dopamine transporter imaging helped to differentiate DLB from non-DLB dementia.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

The primary outcome was the total number of days spent in psychiatric hospitalisation in the two years following randomisation. Thirty-three (21%) of the patients had a personality disorder and their duration of hospital stay (105 days) was greater than in those without personality disorder (56 days). There was weak evidence that intensive case management more effective in reducing the duration of care in those with personality disorder than in those without personality disorder.,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
528,36472596,Jama,Effect of Timing by Endometrial Receptivity Testing vs Standard Timing of Frozen Embryo Transfer on Live Birth in Patients Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization: A Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Endometrial receptivity testing is purported to improve live birth following frozen embryo transfer by identifying the optimal embryo transfer time for an individual patient; however, data are conflicting. OBJECTIVE: To compare live birth from single euploid frozen embryo transfer according to endometrial receptivity testing vs standardized timing. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Double-blind, randomized clinical trial at 30 sites within a multicenter private fertility practice in the Eastern US. Enrollment was from May 2018 to September 2020; follow-up concluded in August 2021. Participants underwent in vitro fertilization, preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy, endometrial receptivity testing, and frozen embryo transfer. Those with euploid blastocyst(s) and an informative receptivity result were randomized. Exclusion criteria included recurrent pregnancy loss, recurrent implantation failure, surgically aspirated sperm, donor egg(s), and unmitigated anatomic uterine cavity defects. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention group (n = 381) underwent receptivity-timed frozen embryo transfer, with adjusted duration of progesterone exposure prior to transfer, if indicated by receptivity testing. The control group (n = 386) underwent transfer at standard timing, regardless of receptivity test results. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was live birth. There were 3 secondary outcomes, including biochemical pregnancy and clinical pregnancy. RESULTS: Among 767 participants who were randomized (mean age, 35 years), 755 (98%) completed the trial. All randomized participants were analyzed. The primary outcome of live birth occurred in 58.5% of transfers (223 of 381) in the intervention group vs 61.9% of transfers (239 of 386) in the control group (difference, -3.4% [95% CI, -10.3% to 3.5%]; rate ratio [RR], 0.95 [95% CI, 0.79 to 1.13]; P = .38). There were no significant differences in the intervention vs the control group for the prespecified secondary outcomes, including biochemical pregnancy rate (77.2% vs 79.5%, respectively; difference, -2.3% [95% CI, -8.2% to 3.5%]; RR, 0.97 [95% CI, 0.83 to 1.14]; P = .48) and clinical pregnancy rate (68.8% vs 72.8%, respectively; difference, -4.0% [95% CI, -10.4% to 2.4%]; RR, 0.94 [95% CI, 0.80 to 1.12]; P = .25). There were no reported adverse events. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Among patients for whom in vitro fertilization yielded a euploid blastocyst, the use of receptivity testing to guide the timing of frozen embryo transfer, compared with standard timing for transfer, did not significantly improve the rate of live birth. The findings do not support routine use of receptivity testing to guide the timing of embryo transfer during in vitro fertilization.

529,36632763,Neuropsychopharmacol Rep,A diagnostic test to examine early improvement as a predictor of later response to lurasidone in bipolar depression,"INTRODUCTION: Kato et al. reported results of a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of lurasidone in adults with bipolar depression (BDep). AIM: We performed a post hoc analysis using data from the lurasidone trial to predict later responses from early improvements. METHODS: An early improvement was defined as a ≥20% reduction in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 2; response was defined as a ≥50% reduction in MADRS total score at Week 6; symptomatic remission were defined as a score of ≤8 on MADRS total score at Week 6. RESULTS: Both sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) were higher for the remission outcome than for the response outcome. The interpretation of sensitivity and NPV in the lurasidone group when remission is an outcome is as follows. It means (1) that, from all remitters at Week 6, 80.6% was identified as such at Week 2 on the basis of their early improvement and (2) that a patient showing non-improvement at 2 weeks had 93.5% probability of being a non-remitters at Week 6. However, the values of specificity for both response and remission in the lurasidone group were not high. CONCLUSION: Patients who did not show an early response at Week 2 cannot be predicted with a high probability to also show poor improvement at Week 6. In fact, some patients who did not show early response at 2 weeks might have marked improvement at 6 weeks.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

This quasi-experimental study examined the experience of using a psychosocial assessment instrument to understand caregiver needs delivered in an interview versus a self-administered web-based format. METHODS: Ten family caregivers were randomized to an interview group or a web-based group with two advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). Surveys captured the caregivers' and APRNs' assessment experiences. FINDINGS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two caregiver groups. Both groups rated the assessment instrument as excellent or good, finding it easy to complete capturing real needs they frequently denied or ignored. The APRN reported the web-based format was easier to use. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthcare providers could use web-based caregiver assessment as an effective, efficient method for identifying care needs and planning interventions that promote balance/congruence in caregivers' lives.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
