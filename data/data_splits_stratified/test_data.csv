journal of behavior therapy and experimental psychiatry does fear reduction predict treatment response to exposure for social anxiety disorder fear activation and reduction have traditionally been considered important mechanisms of exposure therapy evidence to date is mixed and impeded by inadequate methodology this study examined the extent to which fear activation and reduction within and across exposures predicted treatment outcomes for social anxiety disorder within a paradigm suitable for their measurement	sixtyeight adults with social anxiety disorder and fear of public speaking completed seven exposure sessions each consisting of seven speeches conducted in virtual reality exposures were identical in duration task requirements and virtual public speaking situation fear was measured with skin conductance and subjective distress ratings at baseline and posttreatment participants completed a public speaking behavioral approach test with a panel of confederate judges subjective fear was measured a standardized questionnaire of anxiety symptoms was administered at baseline posttreatment and onemonth followup	no indices of within or betweensession fear reduction measured by subjective distress and skin conductance response predicted treatment outcome one measure of fear activation was associated with outcomes such that less activation predicted greater symptom reduction remaining indices did not predict outcomes	data were collected in the context of a randomized controlled trial of scopolamine drug group was included in analytic models to account for drug influence vr exposures elicited mild levels of distress that may underestimate levels of distress in clinical settings	findings failed to support fear activation or reduction within or across exposure sessions as significant predictors of treatment outcome for social anxiety treatment implications are discussed,0,2

experimental neurology analysis of combinatorial variability reveals selective accumulation of the fibronectin type iii domains b and d of tenascinc in injured brain tenascinc tnc is a multimodular extracellular matrix glycoprotein that is markedly upregulated in cns injuries where it is primarily secreted by reactive astrocytes different tnc isoforms can be generated by the insertion of variable combinations of one to seven in rats alternatively spliced distinct fibronectin type iii fniii domains to the smallest variant each spliced fniii repeat mediates specific actions on neurite outgrowth neuron migration or adhesion hence different tnc isoforms might differentially influence cns repair we explored the expression pattern of tnc variants after cortical lesions and after treatment of astrocytes with various cytokines using rtpcr we observed a strong upregulation of tnc transcripts containing the spliced fniii domains b or d in injured tissue at 24 days postlesion dpl looking at specific combinations we showed a dramatic increase of tnc isoforms harboring the neurite outgrowthpromoting bd repeat with both the b and d domains being adjacent to each other isoforms containing only the axon growthstimulating spliced domain d were also dramatically enhanced after injury injuryinduced increase of tnc proteins comprising the domain d was confirmed by western blotting and immunostaining of cortical lesions in contrast the fniii modules c and ad1 were weakly modulated after injury the growth cone repulsive a1a2a4 domains were poorly expressed in normal and injured tissue but the smallest isoform which is also repellant was highly expressed after injury expression of the shortest tnc isoform and of variants containing b d or bd was strongly upregulated in cultured astrocytes after tgfbeta1 treatment suggesting that tgfbeta1 could mediate at least in part the injuryinduced upregulation of these isoforms we identified complex injuryinduced differential regulations of tnc isoforms that may well influence axonal regeneration and repair processes in the damaged cns,1,5
pharmacopsychiatry low plasma thyroid indices of depressed patients are attenuated by antidepressant drugs and influence treatment outcome decreased turnover of thyroid indices and blunting of tsh release after trh administration has been associated with depressive disorder a further decrease in plasma thyroid hormone during antidepressant treatment has been reported however the putative association between the plasma thyroid indices concentration and response has not been addressed in the present study 21 depressed inpatients underwent a fourweek double blind antidepressant with amitriptyline and mianserin their plasma thyroid hormone indices total thyroxine tt4 free thyroxine ft4 total triiodothyronine tt3 free triiodothyronine ft3 thyrotropin tsh and thyroglobulin tbg were quantified to elucidate their involvement in depression and during antidepressant drug treatment depressed patients plasma tsh when corrected for age was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects during antidepressant treatment the entire patient cohort showed a significant decrease in plasma tt4 and ft4 concentrations responders showed a significant drop in tt4 ft4 ft3 and t4tbg but nonresponders only a decrease in ft4 during mianserin treatment a decrease was observed in tt4 ft4 ft3 and t4tbg ft4 and ft3 baseline levels correlated positively with the improvement in the hamilton depression rating score hdrs these findings show that depressed inpatients serum tsh levels are within the reference range but significantly lower than those of healthy subjects and those patients who turn out to be nonresponders have potentially lower availability of thyroid hormones than responders therefore we hypothesize that in order to assure clinical improvement in depression an adequate capacity of the thyroid hormone pool is necessary to compensate for the additional antidepressantprovoked decrease in serum thyroid hormone availability,0,3

neuropsychologia when writing 0 zero is easier than writing o o a neuropsychological case study of agraphia though a few case studies reported a dissociation between intact writing of arabic and impaired writing of alphabetical script a detailed experimental analysis of such a dissociation is still lacking we report a followup study of a patient with a parietooccipital lesion who is affected by severe peripheral agraphia for letters but not for arabic digits while letters in writing to dictation are frequently illegible distorted or consist in meaningless strokes arabic digits are wellformed and fluently produced in a series of tasks including copying of letters with tachistoscopic presentation and handwriting on a digitizing tablet several processing levels are assessed in order to localize js functional writing impairment and to determine different processing routes for letters and for numbers overall the results of the experimental investigation suggest a notation specific deficit in the activation of graphomotor patterns for letters but not for digits the study thus adds evidence to the so far reported dissociations between arabic and alphabetical scripts,0,4
molecular brain regulation of endosomal motility and degradation by amyotrophic lateral sclerosis 2alsin dysfunction of alsin particularly its putative rab5 guaninenucleotideexchange factor activity has been linked to one form of juvenile onset recessive familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als2 multiple lines of alsin knockout als2 mice have been generated to model this disease however it remains elusive whether the rab5dependent endocytosis is altered in als2 neurons to directly examine the rab5mediated endosomal trafficking in als2 neurons we introduced green fluorescent protein gfptagged rab5 into cultured hippocampal neurons to monitor the morphology and motility of rab5associated early endosomes here we report that rab5mediated endocytosis was severely altered in als2 neurons excessive accumulation of rab5positive vesicles was observed in als2 neurons which correlated with a significant reduction in endosomal motility and augmentation in endosomal conversion to lysosomes consequently a significant increase in endosomelysosomedependent degradation of internalized glutamate receptors was observed in als2 neurons these phenotypes closely resembled the endosomal trafficking abnormalities induced by a constitutively active form of rab5 in wildtype neurons therefore our findings reveal a negatively regulatory mechanism of alsin in rab5mediated endosomal trafficking suggesting that enhanced endosomal degradation in als2 neurons may underlie the pathogenesis of motor neuron degeneration in als2 and related motor neuron diseases,0,8

dementia and geriatric cognitive disorders factorial validation of the severe impairment battery for patients with alzheimers disease a pilot study the severe impairment battery sib estimates the cognitive aptitudes and other skills of severely impaired dementia patients the main objective of this pilot study was to clearly identify the number of factors present in the sib and to analyze the relationships between the different cognitive domains explored by the sib and loss of autonomy we administered the sib the mini mental state examination mmse and two scales of dependency to 48 patients with alzheimers disease in its late stages a factorial analysis principal components analysis showed a 4factor solution for the sib a cognitive factor a praxis and visuospatial functions factor the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor a factorial analysis involving the dependency scales showed a cognitive factor a dependency and constructional praxis factor the reactivity to external stimuli factor and the social aptitudes factor reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes were not significantly correlated to cognitive aspects nor to dependency the finding of dependency as a factor different from cognitive deterioration suggests that in setting a treatment strategy for demented patients attempts should be made to treat dependency in its own right in addition since reactivity to external stimuli and social aptitudes are not related to cognitive aspects nor to dependency these functions should also be encouraged and stimulated,0,0
journal of clinical psychology somatic burden and perceived cognitive problems in traumaexposed adults with posttraumatic stress symptoms or pain posttraumatic stress disorder ptsd is associated with somatic and cognitive changes which may be magnified when accompanied by persistent pain the mechanisms of somatic sensation processing may extend to cognitive symptoms revealing a potential generalization of impairment across cognitive and somatic domains in ptsd we hypothesized that somatic burden would mediate relationships between ptsd pain and perceived cognitive impairment	two samples360 traumaexposed college students and 268 mechanical turk userscompleted selfreport measures	both samples revealed similar findings there was a significant indirect effect of ptsd and pain on perceived cognitive problems through somatic burden there remained a direct effect of ptsd symptoms these findings indicate that in traumaexposed samples with pain somatic burden rather than pain severity accounts for perceived cognitive problems	high somatic burden may reflect an underlying appraisal about somatic cues which extend in part to interpretation of cognitive cues,0,0
brain research bulletin nlrp3 inflammasome inhibition by histone acetylation ameliorates sevofluraneinduced cognitive impairment in aged mice by activating the autophagy pathway agerelated cognitive impairment is associated with diminished autophagy and progressively increased neuroinflammation histone acetylation has been shown to be a key process in sevofluraneinduced neurobehavioral abnormalities here we investigated whether histone acetylation regulates the interaction between autophagy and the nlrp3 inflammasome in models of sevofluraneinduced cognitive impairment and explored the underlying molecular mechanisms aged c57bl6 j mice and cultured primary hippocampal neurons were exposed to 3 sevoflurane for 2 h hippocampal tissue samples and hippocampal neurons were harvested the processes of histone acetylation and autophagy and the activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome were observed using western blotting immunofluorescence staining and transmission electron microscopy suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid saha an inhibitor of histone deacetylases increased histone h3 and h4 acetylation in both the mouse hippocampus and primary neurons concomitantly sevoflurane upregulated components of the nlrp3 inflammasome nlrp3 cleaved caspase1 and il1 by promoting autophagic degradation in the aging brain cognitive deficits and inadequate autophagy induced by sevoflurane were reversed and nlrp3 inflammasome activation was inhibited by saha treatment with 3ma an autophagy inhibitor eliminated the neuroprotective effects of saha on improving cognition in mice activating autophagy and downregulating the nlrp3 inflammasome based on these results histone acetylation activates autophagy plays an important role in inhibiting the activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome to protect the host from excessive neuroinflammation and sevofluraneinduced cognitive dysfunction in the aging brain,1,6
plos one relationship of mechanical impact magnitude to neurologic dysfunction severity in a rat traumatic brain injury model traumatic brain injury tbi is a major brain injury type commonly caused by traffic accidents falls violence or sports injuries to obtain mechanistic insights about tbi experimental animal models such as weightdropinduced tbi in rats have been developed to mimic closedhead injury in humans however the relationship between the mechanical impact level and neurological severity following weightdropinduced tbi remains uncertain in this study we comprehensively investigated the relationship between physical impact and graded severity at various weightdrop heights	the acceleration impact force and displacement during the impact were accurately measured using an accelerometer a pressure sensor and a highspeed camera respectively in addition the longitudinal changes in neurological deficits and balance function were investigated at 1 4 and 7 days post tbi lesion the inflammatory expression markers tested by western blot analysis including glial fibrillary acidic protein betaamyloid precursor protein and bone marrow tyrosine kinase gene in chromosome x in the frontal cortex hippocampus and corpus callosum were investigated at 1 and 7 days postlesion	gradations in impact pressure produced progressive degrees of injury severity in the neurological score and balance function western blot analysis demonstrated that all inflammatory expression markers were increased at 1 and 7 days postimpact injury when compared to the sham control rats the severity of neurologic dysfunction and induction in inflammatory markers strongly correlated with the graded mechanical impact levels	we conclude that the weightdropinduced tbi model can produce graded brain injury and induction of neurobehavioral deficits and may have translational relevance to developing therapeutic strategies for tbi,1,5

journal of gambling studies the impacts of gaming expansion on economic growth a theoretical reconsideration this paper employs a general equilibrium framework to analyze the effects on economic growth of global expansions in casino gaming which exports gambling services largely to nonresidents both domestic and foreign investments in the gaming sector bring in not only substantial revenues but also positive spillover effects on related sectors and even on the entire local economy however an overexpansion of commercial gambling may lead to deterioration in the terms of trade with an adverse impact on real income if this situation persists it would not be impossible for immiserizing growth to occur as a highly profitable sector casino gaming may enable its operators to diversify out of this risk if they invest retained profits in nongaming sectors to cash in on the spillover effects it has created the gamingdominant economy can then be directed on a more balanced and sustainable growth path and will become less susceptible to business cycles indeed economic experiences in the worlds major casino resorts are consistent basically with this argument for diversification we believe that after the current global crisis fades away economic growth and resulting surges in global demand for gambling services can provide further opportunities for the expansion of existing casino resorts and the development of new gaming markets,0,1

pediatrics relationship of pneumothorax to occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage in the premature newborn the relationship of pneumothorax to the occurrence of intraventricular hemorrhage ivh has been studied in the premature newborn the major objective of the study was to determine whether the systemic hemodynamic changes that occur with pneumothorax are reflected in the cerebral circulation and whether these changes play a role in pathogenesis of ivh blood flow velocity was measured in the anterior cerebral arteries by a transcutaneous doppler technique in nine infants who developed pneumothorax in the first 3 days of life at the time of pneumothorax there was a marked increase in flow velocity especially during diastole and with resolution of pneumothorax flow velocity returned to normal levels over the ensuing hours the changes in flow velocity correlated closely with systemic hemodynamic changes that occurred with pneumothorax ie and increase in mean systemic blood pressure especially diastolic pressure ivh documented by serial ultrasound scans was observed shortly after pneumothorax in the nine infants the data thus demonstrate a marked increase in flow velocity in the cerebral circulation at the time of pneumothorax this increase is of importance in the genesis of ivh as is suggested further by the occurrence of ivh soon after the cerebral hemodynamic changes,0,0

behavioral and brain functions  bbf genetic association between apoe4 and neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with probable alzheimers disease is dependent on the psychosis phenotype neuropsychiatric symptoms such as psychosis are prevalent in patients with probable alzheimers disease ad and are associated with increased morbidity and mortality because these disabling symptoms are generally not well tolerated by caregivers patients with these symptoms tend to be institutionalized earlier than patients without them the identification of protective and risk factors for neuropsychiatric symptoms in ad would facilitate the development of more specific treatments for these symptoms and thereby decrease morbidity and mortality in ad the e4 allele of the apolipoprotein e apoe gene is a welldocumented risk factor for the development of ad however genetic association studies of the apoe 4 allele and bps in ad have produced conflicting findings	this study investigates the association between apoe and neuropsychiatric symptoms in a large sample of clinically wellcharacterized subjects with probable ad n790 who were systematically evaluated using the consortium to establish a registry for alzheimers disease cerad behavioral rating scale for dementia brsd	our study found that hallucinations were significantly more likely to occur in subjects with no apo4 alleles than in subjects with two 4 alleles 15 of subjects and 5 of subjects respectively p0066 whereas there was no association between the occurrence of delusions aberrant motor behavior or agitation and the number of 4 alleles however 94 of the subjects with hallucinations also had delusions dh	these findings suggest that in ad the 4 allele is differentially associated with dh but not delusions alone this is consistent with the hypothesis that distinct psychotic subphenotypes may be associated with the apoe allele,0,0
british journal of addiction implications of gender for alcohol treatment research a quantitative and qualitative review previous reviews of alcohol treatment research have indicated that in the majority of studies there are no sex differences in treatment outcome the current metaanalysis was used to measure the magnitude and direction of trends of sex difference in treatment outcome the results indicated that women had better treatment outcomes than men in the first 12 months after treatment while men showed greater improvement than women in followups after 12 months however the estimated differences were small and derived from a heterogeneous sample of studies evidence from the studies in the metaanalysis is used to highlight the importance of genderrelated factors which may impact on the processes and outcomes of treatment in particular sex differences in physiological responses to alcohol in social norms for alcohol and in sociocultural experiences are considered important areas for future investigation in alcohol treatment research,0,1
turkish journal of medical sciences relationship between headache and internet addiction in children we aimed to investigate internet addiction in pediatric patients with migraine and tensiontype headache in this study	among our 200 subjects 103 had migrainetype headache and 97 had tensiontype headache	headache triggered by computer use was more common in the migrainetype headache group there was no difference between the internet addiction scale score of the two groups the internet addiction scale scores of the patients were found to differ depending on the aim and duration of computer use internet addiction was found in six 6 patients internet addiction prevalence was 37 and 85 in the two groups respectively	the prevalence of internet addiction in children with recurrent headache was lower than that found in their peers in turkey possibly due to avoidance of computer use as a headache trigger this finding raises the question of whether migraine or tensiontype headaches actually prevent internet addiction,0,0
european radiology uncontrolled hypertension associates with subclinical cerebrovascular health globally a multimodal imaging study the study aimed to analyze the association between hypertension control and subclinical cerebrovascular health using a comprehensive multimodal imaging approach	the study included 200 hypertensive older males without previous cardiovascular diseases clinic blood pressure bp was measured using a standard approach cerebrovascular health was evaluated using magnetic resonance imaging in the following four aspects intracranial atherosclerosis as determined by vessel wall imaging vascular rarefaction defined as less discernible vessels on angiography was evaluated using a customdeveloped technique cerebral blood flow cbf and white matter hyperintensity wmh were assessed using arterial spinlabeling imaging and fluidattenuated inversion recovery imaging respectively	a total of 189 subjects had mri scans the mean age was 649  72 years for intracranial atherosclerosis there was a significant association between uncontrolled hypertension and presence of intracranial plaque when systolic and diastolic bp were analyzed separately the association remained significant for both for vascular rarefaction uncontrolled hypertension was associated with less discernible vessel branches or shorter vessel length on angiography further analysis revealed that this is due to uncontrolled diastolic bp but not uncontrolled systolic bp there was an association between uncontrolled hypertension and reduced cbf which was also mainly driven by uncontrolled diastolic bp we also found that uncontrolled diastolic bp but not uncontrolled systolic bp was associated with increased wmh volume	uncontrolled hypertension was associated with subclinical cerebrovascular injury globally with both small and mediumtolarge arteries being affected	 in this study we leveraged the advantage of a series of cuttingedge mr imaging and analysis techniques and found uncontrolled hypertension is associated with subclinical globally compromised cerebrovascular health  the detrimental consequences of uncontrolled bp affect not only the small vessels but also the mediumtolarge arteries and uncontrolled systolic and diastolic bp are both independently associated with certain types of cerebrovascular injury  our data suggest that cerebrovascular health is impaired globally in uncontrolled hypertension before the onset of stroke,0,0
