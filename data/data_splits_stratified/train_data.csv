developmental science instrumental learning and cognitive flexibility processes are impaired in children exposed to early life stress children who experience severe early life stress show persistent deficits in many aspects of cognitive and social adaptation early stress might be associated with these broad changes in functioning because it impairs general learning mechanisms to explore this possibility we examined whether individuals who experienced abusive caregiving in childhood had difficulties with instrumental learning andor cognitive flexibility as adolescents fiftythree 1417yearold adolescents 31 exposed to high levels of childhood stress 22 control completed an fmri task that required them to first learn associations in the environment and then update those pairings adolescents with histories of early life stress eventually learned to pair stimuli with both positive and negative outcomes but did so more slowly than their peers furthermore these stressexposed adolescents showed markedly impaired cognitive flexibility they were less able than their peers to update those pairings when the contingencies changed these learning problems were reflected in abnormal activity in learning and attentionrelated brain circuitry both altered patterns of learning and neural activation were associated with the severity of lifetime stress that the adolescents had experienced taken together the results of this experiment suggest that basic learning processes are impaired in adolescents exposed to early life stress these general learning mechanisms may help explain the emergence of social problems observed in these individuals,0,0

autism research  official journal of the international society for autism research attribution of intentions in autism spectrum disorder a study of eventrelated potentials autism spectrum disorder asd is characterized by social cognition deficits including difficulties inferring the intentions of others although deficits in attribution of intentions ai have been consistently replicated in asd their exact nature remains unexplored here we registered the electrophysiological correlates of a nonverbal social cognition task to investigate ai in autistic adults twentyone male autistic adults and 30 male neurotypical volunteers performed a comic strips task depicting either intentional action ai or physical causality with or without human characters while their electroencephalographic signal was recorded compared to neurotypical volunteers autistic participants were significantly less accurate in correctly identifying congruence in the ai condition but not in the physical causality conditions in the ai condition a bilateral posterior positive eventrelated potential erp occurred 200400 ms poststimulus the erp intention effect in both groups this waveform comprised a p200 and a p300 component with the p200 component being larger for the ai condition in neurotypical volunteers but not in autistic individuals who also showed a longer latency for this waveform group differences in amplitude of the erp intention effect only became evident when we compared autistic participants to a subgroup of similarly performing neurotypical participants suggesting that the atypical erp waveform in asd is an effect of group rather than a marker of lowtask performance together these results suggest that the lower accuracy of the asd group in the ai task may result from impaired early attentional processing and contextual integration of socially relevant cues lay summary to understand why autistic people have difficulties in inferring others intentions we asked participants to judge the congruence of the endings of comic strips depicting either intentional actions eg fetching a chair to reach for something or situations solely following physical rules eg an apple falling on someones head while their electrical brain activity was recorded autistic individuals had more difficulties in inferring intentions than neurotypical controls which may reflect impaired attention and contextual integration of social cues,0,0

psychopharmacology bulletin comparing the methods used to compare antidepressants a wide array of antidepressants are now available to treat depression however the conventional wisdom that these medications are equally effective may not be true it is argued that most randomized controlled trials rcts do not have the power to discriminate between an effective and an even more effective medication until rcts that enroll 300 or more patients per arm are conducted or more sensitive research designs are developed it will be difficult to determine if a not statistically different finding reflects true therapeutic equivalence or if it is a falsenegative result or type ii error statistical methods that evaluate data from a number of studies are used increasingly to compare treatment strategies the relative merits and limitations of quantitative metaanalysis and pooled analysis of original data are discussed the former method is preferred when a large number of relevant rcts can be analyzed beyond the number of studies publication bias file drawer effect and study selection criteria may influence outcomes of metaanalysis pooled analysis which combines all original patient data is preferred when there are only a handful of related rcts however the integrity of a pooled analysis can be ruined by selective inclusion of studies cherry picking the validity of combining the data from different studies also must be demonstrated results of studies using these complementary methods suggest that there may be clinically meaningful differences in efficacy between several classes of antidepressants,0,1

journal of neurosurgery a novel method to determine the natural course of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations without the need for followup information objectivethere is a strong clinical need to accurately determine the average annual hemorrhage risk in unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations avms this need motivated the present initiative to use data from a uniquely large patient population and design a novel methodology to achieve a risk determination with unprecedented accuracy the authors also aimed to determine the impact of sex pregnancy avm volume and location on the risk for avm rupturemethodsthe present study does not consider any specific management of the avms but only uses the age distribution for the first hemorrhage the shape of which becomes universal for a sufficiently large set of patients for this purpose the authors collected observations including age at first hemorrhage and avm size and location in 3425 patients the average annual risk for hemorrhage could then be determined from the simple relation that the number of patients with their first hemorrhage at a specific age equals the risk for hemorrhage times the number of patients at risk at that age for a subset of the patients the information regarding occurrence of avm hemorrhage after treatment of the first hemorrhage was used for further analysis of the influence on risk from avm location and pregnancyresultsthe age distribution for the first avm hemorrhage was used to determine the average annual risk for hemorrhage in unruptured avms at adult ages 2560 years it was concluded to be 31  02 and unrelated to avm volume but influenced by its location with the highest risk for centrally located avms the hemorrhage risk was found to be significantly higher for females in their fertile yearsconclusionsthe present methodology allowed the authors to determine the average annual risk for the first avm hemorrhage at 31  02 without the need for individual patient followup this methodology has potential also for other similar types of investigations the conclusion that centrally located avms carry a higher risk was confirmed by followup information followup information was also used to conclude that pregnancy causes a substantially greater avm hemorrhage risk the age distribution for avm hemorrhage is incompatible with avms present at birth having the same hemorrhage risk as avms in adults plausibly they instead develop in the early years of life possibly with a lower hemorrhage risk during that time period,0,0

electroencephalography and clinical neurophysiology effects of sleep loss on delta 033 hz eeg and eye movement density new observations and hypotheses one nights sleep loss in young adults increased delta 033 hz eeg only in the first nonrem period of recovery sleep the delta increase was limited to frequencies 034 hz within this range the effects on wave form periods and amplitudes differed by frequency band these results illustrate the value of computer analysis applied to the physiological units of sleep the successive nonrem and rem periods of each sleep cycle the finding that all of the delta increase occurred in the first sleep cycle appears inconsistent with the exponential decline of delta across cycles predicted by recovery models of sleep the fact that wave periods and amplitudes are differentially affected by sleep loss indicates that it is premature to adopt any single wave form characteristic eg power spectral density to index delta sleep our data also confirm a recent report that eye movement density decreases after sleep loss we hypothesize that this change results from greater depth of sleep an inverse relation of depth of sleep to eye movement density provides a coherent explanation for a range of otherwise disparate observations lastly we propose a new hypothesis to account for the presence of eye movement during rem sleep,0,0

american journal of medical genetics sensory gating deficits in parents of schizophrenics although schizophrenia clusters in families it is not inherited in mendelian fashion this suggests that there may be alternative phenotypic expressions of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia such as more elementary physiological or biochemical defects one proposed phenotype is impaired inhibitory gating of the auditory evoked potential to repeated stimuli normally the amplitude of the p50 response to the second stimulus is significantly less than the response to the first but this gating of response is generally impaired in schizophrenia clinically unaffected individuals within a pedigree who have both an ancestral and descendant history of schizophrenia may be useful for studying whether this physiological defect is a possible alternative phenotype we have studied inhibitory gating of the auditory p50 response to pairs of auditory stimuli in 17 nuclear families in 11 there was one parent who had another relative with a chronic psychotic illness in addition to the schizophrenic proband all of the parents with family histories of schizophrenia had gating of the p50 response similar to their schizophrenia offspring whereas only 7 of the parents without family history had gating of the p50 response in the abnormal range these results support loss of gating of the auditory p50 wave as an inherited deficit related to schizophrenia and suggest that studies of parents may help elucidate the neurobiological expression of genes that convey risk for schizophrenia,0,0

diabetes altered brain dynamics in patients with type 1 diabetes during working memory processing it is now generally accepted that diabetes increases the risk for cognitive impairment but the precise mechanisms are poorly understood a critical problem in linking diabetes to cognitive impairment is that patients often have multiple comorbidities eg obesity hypertension that have been independently linked to cognitive deficits in the study reported here we focused on young adults with and without type 1 diabetes who were virtually free of such comorbidities the two groups were matched on major health and demographic factors and all participants completed a verbal working memory task during magnetoencephalographic brain imaging we hypothesized that patients would have altered neural dynamics in verbal working memory processing and that these differences would directly relate to clinical disease measures accordingly we found that patients had significantly stronger neural responses in the superior parietal cortices during memory encoding and significantly weaker activity in parietaloccipital regions during maintenance compared with control subjects moreover disease duration and glycemic control were both significantly correlated with neural responses in various brain regions in conclusion young healthy adults with type 1 diabetes already have aberrant neural processing relative to their peers without diabetes using compensatory responses to perform the task and glucose management and duration may play a central role,0,0

journal of urban health  bulletin of the new york academy of medicine the social course of drug injection and sexual activity among ymsm and other highrisk youth an agenda for future research the cumulative epidemiologic literature indicates that many injecting drug users idus initiate injection as a mode of drug administration during late adolescence or early adulthood recent studies have shown that idus are often exposed to viral infections relatively early in the course of injection highlighting the importance of understanding this initiation process for both epidemiology and prevention epidemiologic evidence similarly suggests that at least some youth populations most notably young men who have sex with men ymsm are at substantial risk for exposure to hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases stds from early sexual activity despite the importance of this issue for both epidemiology and prevention however surprisingly little information is available on the social course of injection initiation including the individual social or ecological factors that might mitigate or exacerbate transmission risks within the critical phase of early injection drug use similarly we know little about the ways that ymsm and other highrisk youth understand risk the kinds of exchanges and relationships in which they participate in the context of initiating sexual activity or how drug use is operant in these exchanges and early sexual experiences in this article we explore key dimensions of the early initiation of injection and sexual risk and discuss how a social network approach might be instrumental in understanding the social course of drug injection and sexual activities among youth and young adult populations,0,1
headache is abdominal pain a feature of adult migraine recurrent abdominal pain in children frequently diagnosed as abdominal migraine is thought to evolve into more typical migraine headache during the teens and twenties if this transformation occurred we would expect some adult migraineurs to retain abdominal pain but we could not recall this symptom being mentioned by patients however without direct questioning the absence cannot be assumed we therefore asked 100 migraineurs about abdominal symptoms during migraine attacks only one experienced unexplained abdominal pain we conclude that abdominal pain is not a feature in adult migraineurs leading us to support the notions that 1 recurrent abdominal pain of childhood has a number of causes 2 abdominal migraine may be an incorrect attribution and is liable to be over diagnosed 3 abdominal migraine requires more precise definition 4 the transition from childhood abdominal migraine to adult migraine needs precise prospective study,0,0

molecular neurobiology intranasal delivery of a caspase1 inhibitor in the treatment of global cerebral ischemia caspase1 is an enzyme implicated in neuroinflammation a critical component of many diseases that affect neuronal degeneration however it is unknown whether a caspase1 inhibitor can modify apoptotic neuronal damage incurred during transient global cerebral ischemia gci and whether intranasal administration of a caspase1 inhibitor is an effective treatment following gci the present study was conducted to examine the potential efficiency of postischemic intranasal administration of the caspase1 inhibitor bocdcmk in a 4vessel occlusion model of gci in the rat herein we show that intranasal bocdcmk readily penetrated the central nervous system subsequently inhibiting caspase1 activity decreasing mitochondrial dysfunction and attenuating caspase3dependent apoptotic pathway in ischemiavulnerable hippocampal ca1 region further investigation regarding the mechanisms underlying bocdcmks neuroprotective effects revealed marked inhibition of reactive gliosis as well as reduction of the neuroinflammatory response via inhibition of the downstream proinflammatory cytokine production intranasal bocdcmk posttreatment also significantly enhanced the numbers of neunpositive cells while simultaneously decreasing the numbers of tunelpositive and parp1positive cells in hippocampal ca1 correspondingly behavioral tests showed that deteriorations in spatial learning and memory performance and longterm recognition memory following gci were significantly improved in the bocdcmk posttreated animals in summary the current study demonstrates that the caspase1 inhibitor bocdcmk coordinates antiinflammatory and antiapoptotic actions to attenuate neuronal death in the hippocampal ca1 region following gci furthermore our data suggest that pharmacological inhibition of caspase1 is a promising neuroprotective strategy to target ischemic neuronal injury and functional deficits following transient gci,1,6
european journal of pediatrics the longterm treatment of a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus and glutaric aciduria type 1 the effect of insulin the coexistence of two diseases associated with different metabolic disorders is a very rare event some associations although sporadic can be particularly challenging both in terms of diagnostic and therapeutic management and in terms of theoretical perspective here we report a child affected by type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm and glutaric aciduria type 1 ga1 the child was diagnosed with classical t1dm at 15 months of age with a tendency toward hypoglycemia a few months later during an acute intercurrent infective episode the child displayed acute hypotonia of the lower limbs and limbs dystonia a brain mri showed bilateral striatal necrosis suggesting ga1 diagnosis treatment with a lowlysine dietary regimen and carnitine supplementation was started and resulted in an improvement in metabolic control and a reduction of hypoglycemic episodes along with an increasing in insulin daily dose after 2 years the neurological outcome consisted of a reduction in dystonic movements and a metabolic stability of both diseases	this case provides some insight into the reciprocal interconnections between the two metabolic disorders similar pathogenic mechanisms responsible for the neuronal injury might have impacted each other and a strict relationship between a specific aspect of ga1impaired metabolism and glucose homeostasis might explain how the tailored management of ga1 was not only effective in controlling the disease but it also resulted in an improvement in the control of the glycemic profile what in known  glutaric aciduria type 1 ga1 usually presents in childhood with severe and possibly irreversible neuronal damage triggered by a catabolic stress  the association of ga1 with other diseases including type 1 diabetes mellitus t1dm is a rare event complicating the treatment management what is new  insulin treatment has a role in preventing ga1 metabolic decompensation even in the catabolic condition of hypoglycemia  promoting ga1 metabolic equilibrium by tailoring drug and dietary treatment in our patient affect by t1dm has a positive impact also in improving glycemic balance,0,4

frontiers in public health understanding panic buying through an integrated psychodynamic lens previous literature has identified panic buying as often being a response to environmental stressors in early 2020 we saw an increase in panic buying as a response to a real andor perceived lack of resources due to covid19 although panic buying has a long history there is a lack of literature to provide a psychological understanding of the phenomenon during the early days of covid19 clients presented with fear and uncertainty these negative emotions were in part a response to a real shortage of basic supplies however the panic response led to behaviors that for some individuals resulted in atypical buying patterns from a therapeutic perspective one can consider behavioral and psychodynamic explanations and interventions and how this impacts the associated behaviors this article will focus on psychodynamic understandings of panic buying as a response to events that result in negative emotions by providing a psychodynamic understanding of panic buying authors hope to contribute to the therapy of clients presenting with related behaviors and their associated negative affect,0,1

neuropsychopharmacology reports the effectiveness of lamotrigine for persistent depressive disorder a case report persistent depressive disorder pdd was first introduced in the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders 5th edition dsm5 which encompasses numerous different conditions including dysthymia recurrent major depressive disorder double depression and chronic major depression ssris are the firstline drugs for treatment of pdd however not all patients respond to ssri treatment	we describe a woman who was diagnosed with pdd at the age of 38 the patient presented with anxiety reduced energy marked tiredness and sleep disturbances she was prescribed with three antidepressants paroxetine duloxetine and mirtazapine which were not effective in relieving her symptoms she was also prescribed bromazepam which was also not effective subsequently she was switched to lamotrigine which resulted in a marked improvement in symptoms the antidepressants and bromazepam were gradually tapered and discontinued	this case demonstrates that lamotrigine may be effective for treating patients with antidepressant resistant pdd and suggests that it may be a promising alternative to combination therapy of antidepressants and benzodiazepines in the treatment of pdd,0,4
psychopharmacology the effect of acute morphine on delay discounting in dependent and nondependent rats chronic opiate use is associated with increased impulsivity in both humans and animals and previous studies suggest that acute morphine can increase impulsivity in nondependent rats however the extent to which chronic opiate usage modulates the effect of acute morphine is unknown	rats were trained to delay discount 20  sucrose solution and then randomly assigned to either a dependent group that received a nightly 30 mgkg subcutaneous dose of morphine or a nondependent group that received a nightly saline injection once dependence was established rats were then assigned to one of four acute morphine doses 0 125 25 5 mgkg for 5 days delay discounting curves were determined 225 h after maintenance doses and 1 h after their prescribed acute injections	in nondependent rats 25 and 5 mgkg doses of morphine caused decreased preference for the large reward at all delays acute morphine had no effect on discounting curves in dependent rats	morphine dependence can cause tolerance to the effects of acute morphine on delay discounting,1,6

revue medicale de liege controversies around the diagnosis of adhd complaints about restlessness difficulties to focus and impulsivity are amongst the most frequent reasons for child psychiatric consultations those complaints refer to the core symptoms of the adhd however the diagnosis of adhd is delicate to establish and subject to several controversies regarding its etiopathological origins and therefore its treatment in practice those situations include very different cases and it seems obvious that this is a polyfactorial disorder no single factor alone being sufficient to account for all the difficulties experienced by the children it would therefore be simplistic to consider the adhd as issued only from a neurobiological disorder and to consider a drug treatment only we are rather in favor of an integrative approach and a global treatment on a case by case basis,0,1
journal of neurology neurosurgery and psychiatry sera from patients with multifocal motor neuropathy disrupt the bloodnerve barrier in multifocal motor neuropathy mmn the destruction of the bloodnerve barrier bnb has been considered to be the key step in the disease process the purpose of the present study was to ascertain whether sera from patients with mmn can open the bnb and which component of patient sera is the most important for this disruption	we evaluated the effects of sera from patients with mmn patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and control subjects on the expression of tight junction proteins and vascular cell adhesion molecule1 vcam1 and on the transendothelial electrical resistance teer in human peripheral nerve microvascular endothelial cells pnmecs	the sera from patients with mmn decreased the claudin5 protein expression and the teer in pnmecs however this effect was reversed after application of an antivascular endothelial growth factor antivegf neutralising antibody the vegf secreted by pnmecs was significantly increased after exposure to the sera from patients with mmn the sera from patients with mmn also increased the vcam1 protein expression by upregulating the nuclear factor kappab nfb signalling the immunoglobulin g purified from mmn sera decreased the expression of claudin5 and increased the vcam1 expression in pnmecs	the sera from mmn patients may disrupt the bnb function via the autocrine secretion of vegf in pnmecs or the exposure to autoantibodies against pnmecs that are contained in the mmn sera autoantibodies against pnmecs in mmn sera may activate the bnb by upregulating the vcam1 expression thereby allowing for the entry of a large number of circulating inflammatory cells into the peripheral nervous system,0,8
addictive behaviors common and differential brain abnormalities in gambling disorder subtypes based on risk attitude studying brain abnormalities in behavioral addiction including gd enables us to exclude possible confounding effects of exposure to neurotoxic substances which should provide important insight that can lead to a better understanding of addiction per se there have been a few brain structural magnetic resonance imaging studies for gd although the results have been inconsistent on the other hand gd was suggested to be a heterogeneous disorder in terms of risk attitude we aimed to examine the heterogeneity of gd by combining a behavioral economics task and voxelbased morphometry thirtysix male gd patients and 36 healthy male control subjects underwent a task for estimation of loss aversion which can assess risk attitude in reallife decisionmaking the gd patients were divided into two groups based on their level of loss aversion low and high while both groups showed common gray matter volume reduction in the left supramarginal gyrus and bilateral posterior cerebellum high lossaversion gd showed pronounced reduction in the left posterior cerebellum and additional reduction in the bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortex our study suggests that the heterogeneity of gd is underpinned at the brain structural level this result might be useful for understanding neurobiological mechanisms and for the establishment of precise treatment strategies for gd,0,0

acta neuropathologica pathology and new players in the pathogenesis of brain edema brain edema continues to be a major cause of mortality after diverse types of brain pathologies such as major cerebral infarcts hemorrhages trauma infections and tumors the classification of edema into vasogenic cytotoxic hydrocephalic and osmotic has stood the test of time although it is recognized that in most clinical situations there is a combination of different types of edema during the course of the disease basic information about the types of edema is provided for better understanding of the expression pattern of some of the newer molecules implicated in the pathogenesis of brain edema these molecules include the aquaporins matrix metalloproteinases and growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factors a and b and the angiopoietins the potential of these agents in the treatment of edema is discussed since many molecules are involved in the pathogenesis of brain edema effective treatment cannot be achieved by a single agent but will require the administration of a magic bullet containing a variety of agents released at different times during the course of edema in order to be successful,0,1

the biochemical journal thyrotropinreleasing hormone receptor occupancy determines the fraction of the responsive pool of inositol lipids hydrolysed in rat pituitary tumour cells we report that there are distinct thyrotropinreleasing hormone trhresponsive and unresponsive pools of inositol ins lipids in rat pituitary tumour gh3 cells and present evidence that the size of the responsive pool is determined by the number of activated trhreceptor complexes by use of an experimental protocol in which cycling of 3hins is inhibited and resynthesis occurs with unlabelled ins only we were able to measure specifically the effects of trh on the hydrolysis of the ins lipids present before stimulation a maximally effective dose of trh 1 microm caused a timedependent decrease in 3hlabelled ins lipids that attained a steadystate value of 42  1 of the initial level between 15 and 2 h after 2 h even though there was no further decrease in 3hlabelled ins lipids and no increase in 3hins or 3hins phosphates turnover of ins lipids as assessed as incorporation of 32ppi into ptdins continued at a rate similar to that in cells incubated without licl or unlabelled ins these data indicate that ins lipid turnover was not desensitized during prolonged trh stimulation depletion of lipid 3h radioactivity by trh occurred at higher trh doses on addition of the competitive antagonist chlordiazepoxide addition of 1 micromtrh after 3 h of stimulation by a submaximal 03 nm trh dose caused a further decrease in 3h radioactivity to the minimum level 40 of initial value we propose that the trhresponsive pool of ins lipids in gh3 cells is composed of the complement of ins lipids that are within functional proximity of activated trhreceptor complexes,1,5

alcoholism clinical and experimental research the obsessive compulsive drinking scale a selfrated instrument for the quantification of thoughts about alcohol and drinking behavior it has been suggested that a crucial dimension of alcohol craving includes the concept of both obsessive thoughts about alcohol use and compulsive behaviors toward drinking an interviewbased rating scale the yalebrown obsessive compulsive scaleheavy drinkers ybocshd has been found useful in quantifying this concept in alcoholdependent individuals a selfrating scale the obsessive compulsive drinking scale ocds has been developed by us as a modification of the ybocshd the ybocshd showed excellent interrater reliability in our hands the correlation between the ybocshd and the ocds total scores obtained on 60 alcoholdependent individuals was 083 the testretest correlation for the ocds total score was 096 and the obsessive and compulsive subscales testretest correlations were 094 and 086 respectively the internal consistency of the items in the ocds was high 086 and did not improve significantly with removal of individual items the shared variance between the ocds scores and alcohol consumption during the period of evaluation was only approximately 20 indicating that the dimension measured by the scale was somewhat independent of actual drinking as such it might act as an independent measure of the state of illness for alcoholdependent individuals when used during a prospective 12week treatment research study initial results indicate that the ocds seems to validly measure a dimension of alcohol dependence because it decreased from baseline during alcohol reduction and increased in relationship to relapse drinkingabstract truncated at 250 words,0,0

plos genetics the replication of frataxin gene is assured by activation of dormant origins in the presence of a gaarepeat expansion it is well known that dna replication affects the stability of several trinucleotide repeats but whether replication profiles of human loci carrying an expanded repeat differ from those of normal alleles is poorly understood in the endogenous context we investigated this issue using cell lines from friedreichs ataxia patients homozygous for a gaarepeat expansion in intron 1 of the frataxin gene by interphase fish we found that in comparison to the normal frataxin sequence the replication of expanded alleles is slowed or delayed according to molecular combing origins never fired within the normal frataxin allele in contrast in mutant alleles dormant origins are recruited within the gene causing a switch of the prevalent fork direction through the expanded repeat furthermore a global modification of the replication profile involving origin choice and a differential distribution of unidirectional forks was observed in the surrounding 850 kb region these data provide a wideview of the interplay of events occurring during replication of genes carrying an expanded repeat,0,8
clinical pharmacokinetics is there a role for therapeutic drug monitoring of new anticonvulsants despite the fact that all new anticonvulsants have undergone extensive pharmacokinetic scrutiny prior to their introduction to the market the opportunity to perform good prospective studies on their concentrationeffect relationship has been largely missed in some cases deliberately because therapeutic drug monitoring tdm is considered unfavourable for the marketing of a new drug however there are reasons to believe that tdm may play a useful role in maximising the therapeutic potential of new anticonvulsants in fact these drugs have a narrow therapeutic index careful individualisation of dosage to optimise response is required and inter and intraindividual pharmacokinetic variability may translate into differences in dosage requirements the wide interindividual variability in the serum concentrations at which therapeutic and toxic effects of these drugs are observed does not necessarily imply that tdm cannot be useful indeed a marked pharmacodynamic variability has also been reported for all the currently monitored older anticonvulsants the new anticonvulsants which based on their properties are particularly attractive candidates for tdm include lamotrigine topiramate tiagabine zonisamide and felbamate however in the absence on sound information on the target concentration ranges of these drugs the routine concentration monitoring of these drugs cannot be recommended despite this serial measurements of serum drug concentrations may be useful in selected patients especially those suspected of poor compliance and those in whom pharmacokinetic changes caused by disease or administration of concomitant medication are anticipated even in the presence of marked interindividual pharmacodynamic variability it is often possible to empirically determine the concentration at which each patient exhibits the best response and apply that information in subsequent management prospective studies using preferably a randomised concentrationcontrolled design are necessary to better characterise concentrationeffect relationships for these agents,0,1

british journal of urology the role of histamine in human penile erection to investigate the relaxant action of histamine on human corpus cavernosum in vitro and the erectile response caused by the intracavernous injection of histamine in patients with psychogenic impotence	human corpus cavernosum hcc tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay the strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed krebs solution and precontracted with noradrenaline 3 microm glyceryl trinitrate acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine for the in vivo studies histamine 3060 micrograms was injected intracavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamopreputial sulcus similar protocols were carried out for papaverine 50 mg the erectile response was divided into four grades no response tumescence partial and full erection	in vitro studies demonstrated that histamine 3100 micrograms caused dosedependent relaxation of the hcc strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine 510 microm the histamine h1 receptor antagonist mepyramine 1 microm potentiated histamineinduced relaxation the coinfusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamineinduced relaxation when injected intracavernously in humans histamine 30 micrograms caused full erection in 13 of the patients whereas 87 had partial erection or tumescence a higher dose of histamine 60 micrograms caused full erection in 26 of the patients and 74 had partial erection or tumescence papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients 66 in contrast to papaverine the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter mean 200 and 65 min respectively the penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain haematoma and priapism histamine did not induce any complications treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine h1 receptor antagonist astemizol 10 mg orally once daily for 1 week did not affect histamineinduced erectile responses	these results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection the erectionpromoting action of histamine is probably due to h2 receptor activation although another histamine receptor possibly h3 also seems to be involved this study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction,0,3
ambulatory pediatrics  the official journal of the ambulatory pediatric association improving care for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder assessing the impact of selfassessment and targeted training on practice performance major gaps exist between usual clinical practice and evidencebased recommendations for care many interventions to improve care are costly and time intensive this study sought to determine whether a clinicians selfassessment of their practice performance for the diagnosis and management of children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd followed by attendance at a 2day conference focused on system change would result in improvement in care	quasiexperimentalbefore and after with external controls	clinician attendees compared with convenience sample of nonattendees	consistency with 10 specific recommendations from the american academy of pediatrics guidelines concerning adhd	logistic regression with use of generalized estimating equations to account for clustering of subjects within clinician practices	widespread deficiencies in care were present prior to the intervention practice improved significantly more among conference attendees in 2 of the 10 performance measures evaluation for coexisting conditions and offering treatment options with positive trends in most of the other indicators	practice assessment and systembased training may be a costeffective strategy to improve practice performance,0,2
nature genetics mutation of tdp1 encoding a topoisomerase idependent dna damage repair enzyme in spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy tyrosyldna phosphodiesterase 1 tdp1 repairs covalently bound topoisomerase idna complexes and is essential for preventing the formation of doublestrand breaks that result when stalled topoisomerase i complexes interfere with dna replication in yeast here we show that a deficiency of this dna repair pathway in humans does not predispose to neoplasia or dysfunctions in rapidly replicating tissues but instead causes spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy scan1 by affecting large terminally differentiated nondividing neuronal cells using genomewide linkage mapping and a positional candidate approach in a saudi arabian family affected with autosomal recessive scan1 we identified a homozygous mutation in tdp1 a1478g that results in the substitution of histidine 493 with an arginine residue the his493 residue is conserved in tdp1 across species and is located in the active site of the enzyme protein modeling predicts that mutation of this amino acid to arginine will disrupt the symmetric structure of the active site we propose that lossoffunction mutations in tdp1 may cause scan1 either by interfering with dna transcription or by inducing apoptosis in postmitotic neurons,0,0
neurorehabilitation effects of injury severity and cognitive exaggeration on olfactory deficits in head injury compensation claims the purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between exaggeration and scores on a test of olfactory discrimination in patients being assessed in connection with a claim for financial benefits participants were 448 patients referred to a private practice in edmonton alberta canada for psychological or neuropsychological assessment related to evaluation of impairment and disability resulting from a workrelated or nonwork related accident all patients were involved in some form of compensation claim at the time of their evaluation all patients completed two tests designed to detect exaggerated cognitive deficits the computerized assessment of response bias carb and the word memory test wmt as part of their evaluation the diagnostic groups included 322 head injury cases varying from very minor to very severe normative data for the smell test were derived from 126 patients with orthopedic injuries who passed both the carb and the wmt patients with more severe traumatic brain injuries were 1012 times more likely to have olfactory deficits than persons with trivial to mild head injuries in a subgroup of patients who failed either the carb or the wmt there was no relationship between injury severity and total scores on the smell test therefore the doseresponse relationship between brain injury severity and olfactory deficits is severely attenuated when patients who are probably exaggerating their cognitive deficits are included in the analyses those patients with trivial to mild head injuries who demonstrated adequate effort on both the carb and the wmt were no more likely to show olfactory deficits than the nonheadinjured orthopedic control subjects therefore anosmia following mild traumatic brain injury should not be concluded from selfreports or from tests of smell unless tests of effort have been passed effort should also be controlled in group studies of olfaction,0,0
experimental brain research dopamine boosts intention and action awareness in parkinsons disease dopaminergic deficiency in parkinsons disease pd has been associated with underactivation of the supplementary motor area and a reduction of voluntary actions in these patients awareness of intention to act has been shown to be delayed however delayed awareness of intention to act has also been shown in patients with hyperdopaminergic states and an excess of unwilled movements as in tourettes and in patients with functional movement disorders hence the role of dopamine in the awareness of intention and action remains unclear 36 pd patients were tested on and off dopaminergic medication and compared with 35 healthy agematched controls in addition 17 pd patients with subthalamic deep brain stimulation dbs were tested on medication and on and off stimulation participants judged either the moment a selfgenerated action was performed or the moment the urge to perform the action was felt using the libet method temporal judgments of intention and action awareness were comparable between unmedicated pd patients and controls dopaminergic medication boosted anticipatory awareness of both intentions and actions in pd patients relative to an unmedicated condition the difference between onoff dbs was not statistically reliable functional improvement of motor ability in pd through dopaminergic supplementation leads to earlier awareness of both intention and of voluntary action,0,3

scientific reports a heritable profile of six mirnas in autistic patients and mouse models autism spectrum disorder asd is a group of developmental pathologies that impair social communication and cause repetitive behaviors the suggested roles of noncoding rnas in pathology led us to perform a comparative analysis of the micrornas expressed in the serum of human asd patients the analysis of a cohort of 45 children with asd revealed that six micrornas mir19a3p mir3615p mir36133p mir1505p mir1263p and mir499a5p were expressed at low to very low levels compared to those in healthy controls a similar but less pronounced decrease was registered in the clinically unaffected parents of the sick children and in their siblings but never in any genetically unrelated control results consistent with these observations were obtained in the blood hypothalamus and sperm of two of the established mouse models of asd valproic acidtreated animals and cc2d1a heterozygotes in both instances the same characteristic mirna profile was evidenced in the affected individuals and inherited together with disease symptoms in the progeny of crosses with healthy animals the consistent association of these genetic regulatory changes with the disease provides a starting point for evaluating the changes in the activity of the target genes and thus the underlying mechanisms from the applied societal and medical perspectives once properly confirmed in large cohorts these observations provide tools for the very early identification of affected children and progenitors,1,5
age dordrecht netherlands growth hormone and insulinlike growth factori alter hippocampal excitatory synaptic transmission in young and old rats in rats as in humans normal aging is characterized by a decline in hippocampaldependent learning and memory as well as in glutamatergic function both growth hormone gh and insulinlike growth factori igfi levels have been reported to decrease with age and treatment with either gh or igfi can ameliorate agerelated cognitive decline interestingly acute gh and igfi treatments enhance glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rat hippocampus of juvenile animals however whether this enhancement also occurs in old rats when cognitive impairment is ameliorated by gh and igfi desigfi remains to be determined to address this issue we used an in vitro ca1 hippocampal slice preparation and extracellular recording techniques to study the effects of acute application of gh and igfi on compound field excitatory postsynaptic potentials fepsps as well as ampa and nmdadependent fepsps in young adult 10 months and old 28 months rats the results indicated that both gh and igfi increased compound ampa and nmdadependent fepsps to a similar extent in slices from both age groups and that this augmentation was likely mediated via a postsynaptic mechanism initial characterization of the signaling cascades underlying these effects revealed that the ghinduced enhancement was not mediated by the jak2 signaling element in either young adult or old rats but that the igfiinduced enhancement involved a pi3kmediated mechanism in old but not young adults the present findings are consistent with a role for a gh or igfiinduced enhancement of glutamatergic transmission in mitigating agerelated cognitive impairment in old rats,1,6

schizophrenia research prospective memory in schizophrenia primary or secondary impairment although a number of studies have now shown that schizophrenia is associated with impaired memory for future intentions prospective memory the degree and nature of the impairment remains to be clarified as does the degree to which this impairment is secondary to deficits in other aspects of cognition in the present study thirty participants with schizophrenia were compared with demographically matched controls on virtual week a measure that closely represents the types of prospective memory tasks that actually occur in everyday life and provides an opportunity to investigate the different sorts of prospective memory failures that occur participants with schizophrenia were significantly and comparably impaired on virtual week irrespective of the specific prospective memory task demands importantly after controlling for general cognitive functioning executive functioning and retrospective memory although the absolute magnitude of the deficit was reduced significant impairment remained these results suggest that individuals with schizophrenia experience generalized difficulties with prospective memory and that whilst other cognitive deficits contribute to these difficulties there is something unique to prospective remembering that is additionally disrupted in schizophrenia,0,0

ophthalmic  physiological optics  the journal of the british college of ophthalmic opticians optometrists randomised controlled trial of the effect of coloured overlays on the rate of reading of people with specific learning difficulties a randomised controlled trial has demonstrated that for selected children with reading difficulties individually prescribed coloured filters reduce symptoms of asthenopia in the present study we investigate the effect of individually prescribed coloured overlays on the rate of reading subjects were 33 children and adults who had consulted a specific learning difficulties clinic had received treatment to normalise any conventional optometric and orthoptic anomalies and subsequently reported symptomatic relief from coloured filters these subjects carried out the wilkins rate of reading test which assesses visual rather than linguistic factors under two conditions with their chosen coloured overlay and with a control filter steps were taken to ensure that a strong placebo effect was associated with the control overlay and when asked which they preferred subjects were not significantly more likely to prefer their coloured overlay than the control filter p011 nonetheless the rate of reading was significantly faster with the coloured overlay than with the control p00019 further analyses support the conclusion that individually prescribed coloured filters can improve reading performance for reasons that cannot be solely attributed to conventional optometric factors or to placebo effects,0,9

the journal of biological chemistry a drosophila protein family implicated in pheromone perception is related to taysachs gm2activator protein low volatility lipidlike cuticular hydrocarbon pheromones produced by drosophila melanogaster females play an essential role in triggering and modulating mating behavior but the chemosensory mechanisms involved remain poorly understood recently we showed that the cheb42a protein which is expressed in only 10 pheromonesensing taste hairs on the front legs of males modulates progression to late stages of male courtship behavior in response to femalespecific cuticular hydrocarbons here we report that expression of all 12 genes in the cheb gene family is predominantly or exclusively gustatoryspecific and occurs in many different often nonoverlapping patterns only the gr family of gustatory receptor genes displays a comparable variety of gustatoryspecific expression patterns unlike grs however expression of all but one cheb gene is sexually dimorphic like cheb42a other chebs may therefore function specifically in gustatory perception of pheromones we also show that chebs belong to the ml superfamily of lipidbinding proteins and are most similar to human gm2activator protein gm2ap in particular gm2ap residues involved in ligand binding are conserved in chebs but not in other ml proteins finally cheb42a is specifically secreted into the inner lumen of pheromonesensing taste hairs where pheromones interact with membranebound receptors we propose that cheb proteins interact directly with lipidlike drosophila pheromones and modulate their detection by the gustatory signal transduction machinery furthermore as loss of gm2ap in taysachs disease prevents degradation of gm2 gangliosides and results in neurodegeneration the function of chebs in pheromone response may involve biochemical mechanisms critical for lipid metabolism in human neurons,0,0
american journal of medical genetics cognitive profiles of the carrier fragile x woman cognitive deficits in females with fragile x frax syndrome have been reported but studies have rarely focused on women with normal intelligence nor have they separated fraxnegative carriers from fraxpositive carriers questions specifically addressed here are 1 is the degree of fragility predictive of iq 2 are cognitive patterns consistent across fragility levels and 3 do consistent individual profiles exist these questions were addressed with the help of 74 heterozygous women 38 of whom were fraxnegative carriers all women completed the waisr and fullscale iq was normally distributed mean  9965 a strong inverse relationship between iq and fragility levels was found also the group of fraxpositive women had a significantly different subtest pattern from that of the fraxnegative women however when results were analyzed individually no consistent patterns emerged the cognitive performance of fraxnegative carriers has probably been underestimated due to the lack of differentiation between positive and negative carrier females in previous studies these women appear to be cognitively unimpaired and should be considered separately from fraxpositive women since consistent waisr patterns are not observable on an individual basis their use as a diagnosticpredictive tool appears to be inappropriate,0,0

liver transplantation  official publication of the american association for the study of liver diseases and the international liver transplantation society liver transplantation in alcoholassociated liver disease ensuring equity through new processes worsened by the covid19 pandemic alcohol use is one of the leading causes of preventable death in the us in large part due to alcoholassociated liver disease throughout history liver transplantation for this population has been controversial and many policies and regulations have existed to limit access to lifesaving transplant for patients who use alcohol in recent years the rates of liver transplantation for patients with alcoholassociated liver disease have increased dramatically however disparities persist for instance many criteria used in evaluation for transplant listing such as social support and prior knowledge of the harms of alcohol use are not evidence based and may selectively disadvantage patients with alcohol use disorder in addition few transplant providers have adequate training in the treatment of alcohol use disorder and few transplant centers offer specialized addiction treatment finally current approaches to liver transplantation would benefit from adopting principles of harm reduction which have demonstrated efficacy in the realm of addiction medicine for years as we look toward the future we must emphasize the use of evidencebased measures in selecting patients for listing ensure access to highquality addiction care for all patients pretransplant and posttransplant and adopt harm reduction beliefs to better address relapse when it inevitably occurs we believe that only by addressing each of these issues will we be able to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources in liver transplantation for all patients,0,1

current drug targets cns and neurological disorders histamine h3 receptor a potential drug target for the treatment of central nervous system disorders histamine h3 receptors were first described in the eighties but finally cloned four years ago they are gprotein coupled mostly presynaptic and are involved in the control of the synthesis andor release of different neurotransmitters both in the central nervous system and the periphery the availabiliy of specific ligands has permitted the study of potential therapeutic applications of either stimulating or blocking the function of these receptors there is experimental evidence that drugs targeted at histamine h3 receptors could be beneficial for neurodegenerative diseases such as alzheimer and parkinsons disease epilepsy drug abuse and several affective appetite and sleeping disorders among others this review presents recent advances in this field,0,1
epilepsy  behavior  eb effects of epilepsy surgery on psychiatric and behavioral comorbidities in children and adolescents when considering surgery in children it is important to think about the potential effect on psychiatric and behavioral outcome a growing body of evidence suggests that the type of epilepsy benign or catastrophic and the age of the patient affect developmental outcome in younger children with catastrophic epilepsy the primary goal of therapy is not only to control seizures but also to offer the child the opportunity for the best possible development in older children with partial seizures the therapeutic goal is to control seizures which may allow a more normal life and improve behavior epilepsy surgery generally appears to have a positive effect on behavior and development in many younger children with catastrophic epilepsy psychiatric and behavioral outcomes in older children with complex partial epilepsy are less clear many patients improve but there does appear to be a small risk of developing new psychiatric or behavioral disorders postoperatively,0,1
journal of immunology baltimore md  1950 transcriptional regulator id2 is required for the cd4 t cell immune response in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis an effective immune response to ag challenge is critically dependent on the size of the effector cell population generated from clonal activation of agspecific t cells the transcription network involved in regulating the size of the effector population particularly for cd4 th cells is poorly understood in this study we investigate the role of id2 an inhibitor of e protein transcription factors in the generation of cd4 effectors using a t cellspecific conditional id2 knockout mouse model we show that inhibitor of dna binding id2 is essential for the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis although agspecific and il17producing cd4 t cells are produced in these mice the activated cd4 t cells form a smaller pool of effector cells in the peripheral lymphoid organs exhibit reduced proliferation and increased cell death and are largely absent in the cns in the absence of id2 e protein targets including the proapoptotic protein bim and socs3 are expressed at higher levels among activated cd4 t cells this study reveals a critical role of id2 in the control of effector cd4 t cell population size and the development of a th17mediated autoimmune disease,1,5

cns  neurological disorders drug targets mitochondrial permeability transition pore as a suitable targ e t for neuroprotective agents against alzheimers disease a considerable amount of data suggests the agerelated impairments of mitochondrial functions in the development of sporadic forms of neurodegenerative pathologies mitochondria and the phenomenon of mitochondrial permeability transition mpt which marks the point of no return in cell death cascades have special value in this regard it is important that the vulnerability to mptinducing factors is increased with aging simultaneously a decrease in the calcium retention capacity of mitochondria is developed which leads to the disturbance of the functional activity of neurons	the systematic investigations and web content related to the importance of mpt as the target for the search of neuroprotective and cognitive enhancing drugs especially with multitargeted action are reviewed	here we have highlighted some experimental data that determines the importance of mitochondria for the search of neuroprotective drugs and drugs with multitargeted action we have also discussed a number of new compounds with similar properties being mpt inhibitorsmodulators virtually all the compounds described in this review have the ability to exhibit a neuroprotective effect interact with some other targets providing coupled beneficial therapeutic effects such as cognitive stimulation antiseizure and antidepressant actions	inhibitors of mpt which increases calcium retention capacity of mitochondria are considered as promising neuroprotective drugs able not only to halt the neurodegenerative cascade but also to increase the functional activity of neurons,0,1
brain and cognition hemispheric differences in temporal resolution a review of the relevant clinical and experimental literature gives the conclusion that the cerebral hemispheres differ in temporal resolution of input with the languagedominant hemisphere showing finer acuity this conclusion is supported by evidence from performance of patients with unilateral brain damage on tests of temporal resolution performance of developmental dyslexics on similar tasks and leftright sensory field differences in temporal acuity in normal human subjects while it is unlikely that a hemispheric difference in temporal resolution is sufficient to give a complete account of lateralized functions such attempts to show more primitive physiological differences between the hemispheres are more likely to be fruitful than attempts which differentiate the hemispheres in terms of higherorder psychological functions,0,1
the psychiatric clinics of north america working with difficulttotreat eating disorders using an integration of twelvestep and traditional psychotherapies in summary we have a multidimensional treatment program that attempts to integrate psychodynamic cognitivebehavioral systemic psychopharmacologic and 12step interventions for patients who have not had previous treatments or patients who are young adolescents we do not emphasize the 12step approach for our difficulttotreat patients our current overall impression is that the benefits of adding the 12step component have outweighed the costs we began the program with an expressed intent of experimenting with the integration staff were subsequently recruited who were open to the experiment and the success of the integration has been a function of the flexibility within the staff our hunch is that this integration would not work as well with an existing staff who harbored prejudice toward either position actually we have found working on the integration quite invigorating our recovering counselors have raised issues that we have not heard raised in the more traditional settings we have been associated with likewise we have seen our counselors grow professionally from hearing alternative views of why individuals struggle and how they get better the exchange has been synergistic rather than divisive although we are encouraged by our early experience it is the longterm outcome that will clarify the relative usefulness of this treatment strategy we are confident that as we live with the integration longer more of the advantages and disadvantages will become apparent and perhaps we can refine our understanding of which subgroup of patients makes most use of this type of integrated approach,0,3

cognition is there a causal link from phonological awareness to success in learning to read in this review we reassess the evidence that phonological awareness represents a skill specific to spoken language that precedes and directly influences the process of reading acquisition longitudinal and experimental training studies are examined in detail as these are considered most appropriate for exploring a causal hypothesis of this nature a particular focus of our analysis is the degree to which studies to date have controlled for existing literacy skills in their participants and the influence that these skills might have on performance on phonological awareness tasks we conclude that no study has provided unequivocal evidence that there is a causal link from competence in phonological awareness to success in reading and spelling acquisition however we believe that such a study is possible and outline some ideas for its design and implementation,0,1

science new york ny a causative link between inner ear defects and longterm striatal dysfunction there is a high prevalence of behavioral disorders that feature hyperactivity in individuals with severe inner ear dysfunction what remains unknown is whether inner ear dysfunction can alter the brain to promote pathological behavior using molecular and behavioral assessments of mice that carry null or tissuespecific mutations of slc12a2 we found that inner ear dysfunction causes motor hyperactivity by increasing in the nucleus accumbens the levels of phosphorylated adenosine 35monophosphate response elementbinding protein pcreb and phosphorylated extracellular signalregulated kinase perk key mediators of neurotransmitter signaling and plasticity hyperactivity was remedied by local administration of the perk inhibitor sl327 these findings reveal that a sensory impairment such as inner ear dysfunction can induce specific molecular changes in the brain that cause maladaptive behaviors such as hyperactivity that have been traditionally considered exclusively of cerebral origin,1,5
current opinion in pulmonary medicine narcolepsy and h1n1 vaccination a link a number of european countries have reported a dramatic increase in the rates of childhood narcolepsy with cataplexy in children immunized with a splitvirion adjuvanted swine flu vaccine here we review the strengths and weaknesses of these epidemiological studies and possible neuroimmunological mechanisms	initial concerns of a 13fold increased relative risk of narcolepsy were raised by the scandinavian health protection agencies in 2010 subsequent retrospective studies support these findings in canada france ireland england and denmark the cases are predominantly young children who present with severe and rapid onset of cataplexy as well as narcolepsy often within a few weeks of vaccination the proposed mechanism for postvaccination narcolepsy is one in which an environmental trigger causes or enhances an antibodymediated autoimmune response in patients with a preexisting genetic susceptibility however there have not yet been any reports of specific autoimmunity either antibody or tcellmediated	there is a strong association between narcolepsy and h1n1 vaccination however whether this reflects a true increase in affected individuals or a hastening of disease onset in individuals who would otherwise have developed narcolepsy later will become clear in the coming years the pathological explanation of this association and narcolepsy is likely to be autoimmune although supportive evidence is lackingvideo abstract available see the video supplementary digital content 1 httplinkslwwcomcopma9,0,1

schizophrenia research the impact of context processing deficits on taskswitching performance in schizophrenia the prefrontal cortex pfc has been described as important for maintaining and implementing contextual information in the service of goaloriented behavior accordingly impairments in context processing are thought to underlie cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia a clinical disorder that has been linked to pfc dysfunction servanschreiber et al 1996 however task switching a cognitive ability linked to pfc function has not been consistently impaired in schizophrenia in this experiment we assessed whether taskswitching performance would be selectively impaired for patients when context demands were high in the ruleswitching condition a switch required the updating of the relevant task response rules whereas perceptual switching did not entail a switching of contextual information instead a perceptual switch entailed a shift of visuospatial attention to the relevant feature a second goal was to determine whether potential deficits in context switching would be observed in schizophrenia even in situations when these patients do not need to overcome a prepotent response studies of context processing have typically required patients with schizophrenia to use contextual rules to overcome prepotent response tendencies whereas our switching paradigm did not require the inhibition of a competing response patients were much slower to switch tasks than controls when contextual rules switched from one trial to the next whereas their performance was intact when the switch occurred between different feature sets and contextual demands were low our results demonstrate that context processing deficits are observable in schizophrenia even when there is no prepotent response tendency to inhibit moreover our results suggest that pfc impairments influence performance primarily when patients are required to switch the application of one explicit rule to another,0,0

medical hypotheses angiotensin receptor blockers for bipolar disorder studies have suggested that the brain renin angiotensin system ras regulates cerebral flow autonomic and hormonal systems stress innate immune response and behavior being implicated in several brain disorders such as major depression parkinsons and alzheimers disease the angiotensin ii receptor subtype 1 at1r is distributed in brain regions responsible for the control of stress response through peripheral and central sympathetic hyperactivation as well as in the hypothalamic paraventricular region areas known for the release of several neurotransmitters related to inflammatory response facilitation this relationship leads to the assumption that at1r might be the receptor most related to the central deleterious actions of angiotensin ii new evidences from clinical studies have shown a possible role for ras in the pathogenesis of bipolar disorder bd a multifactorial disorder with acknowledged presence of neuronal damage via oxidative stress in brain areas such as hippocampus prefrontal cortex and striatum given the studies highlighting at1r activation as a central proinflammatory pathway and conversely the involvement of inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of bd this paper hypothesizes the use of at1r antagonists for bd management and prevention of its neuroprogression due to their antiinflammatory and neuroprotective effects,0,1

psychiatria hungarica  a magyar pszichiatriai tarsasag tudomanyos folyoirata associations between symptom severity and emotion recognition in depressed patients in this study we tried to explore whether there are any associations between symptom severity and emotional facial expression recognition based on the literature and our earlier findings we believe that the impairments of overall not emotion specific facial expression recognition is associated with a more general nonspecific psychiatric distress thus first it was hypothesized that overall facial expression recognition would be correlated negatively with scl90 global severity index gsi our second hypothesis was that the severity of the impairment in facial expression recognition would be correlated with symptom severity measured by the beck depression inventory bdi	one hundred and six depressed subjects participated in the study we used a virtual human for presenting the 35 emotional and neutral facial expressions subjects filled in the bdi and scl90 questionnaires after the facial expression recognition task	significant negative association was found between the gsi of scl90 and the overall facial expression recognition furthermore significant negative correlation was found between the recognition of happy facial expressions and the depression severity measured by the bdi questionnaire and the scl90 depression subscale	the negative association found between overall facial expression recognition and the gsi score provide empirical support to our first hypothesis which states that the impairment of not emotion specific overall facial expression recognition may correlate with a general psychiatric distress our findings indicate that those depressed subjects who had higher scores on bdi could recognize happy facial expression at a significantly lower rate abnormalities in reward sensitivity may explain this association between happy face recognition difficulties and the severity of depressive symptoms among depressive patients consequently we can conclude that the recognition of happy facial expressions can be a useful tool for monitoring the severity of depression,0,1

expert opinion on investigational drugs triple reuptake inhibitors for treating subtypes of major depressive disorder the monoamine hypothesis revisited major depression is one of the most prevalent forms of mental illnesses and is among the leading causes of disability affecting about 121 million people worldwide approximately 30 of patients fail to respond to present therapies therefore the search for novel antidepressant drugs continues	the most prescribed antidepressants are serotonin reuptake inhibitors andor noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors which only indirectly affect dopaminergic neurotransmission as a consequence residual symptoms remain including impaired motivation and impaired pleasure this article reviews the development of new broadspectrum antidepressants the triple reuptake inhibitors which also increase brain dopamine levels	in this review a distinction is made between the subtypes of melancholic and atypical depressions and their associated brain abnormalities and dysfunctions in neurotransmitter systems subsequently we propose a hypothetical model the monoamine hypothesis revisited to predict what kind of pharmacological treatment will be effective in the different subtypes of depression it is expected that the triple reuptake inhibitors inhibiting the reuptake of all three monoamines can produce a greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants especially in atypical depression since triple reuptake inhibitors may also dampen states of hyperglutamatergic activity and subsequent excitotoxicity it is suggested that these new drugs have a considerable neuroprotective potential in major depression especially in melancholic depression,0,1

pharmacology biochemistry and behavior correlation between hippocampal neuronal damage and spatial learning deficit due to global ischemia global cerebral ischemia leads to selective neuronal damage in the ca1 sector of the hippocampus and in the striatum this ischemia leads to a deficit in spatial learning and memory in the water maze the results of earlier studies that have examined the relationship between neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze were not clearcut it has been observed that neuroprotection reduces both the deficit in the water maze and the neuronal damage the present study therefore approached the relationship between the neuronal damage and the deficit in the water maze by pharmacological means global cerebral ischemia was induced in male wistar rats by fourvessel occlusion for 20 min ischemic rats were then treated with the noncompetitive nonnmda receptor antagonist gyki 52466 30 mgkg the radical scavenger ly 231617 20 mgkg the inhibitor of protein kinase c staurosporine 01 mgkg or solvent treatment with gyki 52466 or ly 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial learning by limiting the increase in swim distance due to ischemia in addition ly 231617 reduced the deficit in spatial memory as demonstrated by minimizing the ischemiainduced reduction in time spent in the quadrant of the former platform position during the probe trial staurosporine had no influence on the ischemiainduced behavioural changes histological examination revealed neuronal damage in the hippocampus and in the striatum in all of the ischemic rats however treatment with gyki 52466 or ly 231617 reduced the hippocampal damage correlation analysis demonstrated a correlation between hippocampal damage and total swim distance r  088 p  0001 no correlation was found between hippocampal damage and quadrant time of the probe trial r  024 p  01 no correlation was observed between striatal damage and either total swim distance of the escape trials r  028 p  01 or quadrant time of the probe trial r  008 p  06 it is concluded that a correlation exists between hippocampal damage and the deficit in spatial learning following global cerebral ischemia,1,6

headache insights into the mechanism of onabotulinumtoxina in chronic migraine onabotulinumtoxina has recently been approved by regulatory agencies in the uk and united states for treatment of chronic migraine based on data generated from the preempt studies as such onabotulinumtoxina is the only prophylactic therapy specifically approved for chronic migraine most headache clinicians would agree that acute episodic migraine and chronic migraine differ in their pathophysiology etiology diagnosis and response to pharmacological as well as nonpharmacological therapies of the 7 botulinum neurotoxin serotypes botulinum neurotoxin type a onabotulinumtoxina has been the most thoroughly investigated in preclinical and clinical studies based on preclinical studies onabotulinumtoxina is known to inhibit the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from both motor and sensory neurons by preventing vesicle fusion to the cell membrane in addition to the welldocumented myorelaxant effects of this neurotoxin onabotulinumtoxina can exert a direct analgesic effect that likely involves inhibition of primary and secondary nociceptive neurons the inhibitory effects of onabotulinumtoxina are also likely to involve suppressing the activity of myogenic trigger points and decreasing the persistent nociceptive barrage that promotes and maintains central sensitization this article describes possible mechanisms to explain how onabotulinumtoxina functions as a therapy for chronic migraine and considers why treatment with the neurotoxin is not effective in some chronic migraineurs,0,1

psychological medicine causal attributions about common somatic sensations among frequent general practice attenders the causal attributions that people make about bodily symptoms or sensations are likely to influence their decisions whether or not to consult a doctor previous research has supported the model that people tend initially to look for external or environmental explanations for bodily sensations normalizing attributions and only if this process fails do they search for attributions internal to themselves somatic or psychological attributions this study tested two hypotheses about frequent general practice attenders 1 compared with others they are more likely to make somatic attributions and less likely to make normalizing ones and 2 given a bodily symptom together with a somatic explanation frequent attenders will have greater difficulty than others in finding reasons why the given pathological explanation is untrue the frequent attenders group had themselves initiated an average of 12 general practice visits in the 12 months before assessment while a control group of infrequent attenders had not made appointments to see their general practitioner for an average of 24 months the results provide partial support for the hypotheses frequent attenders generated significantly fewer normalizing explanations for a series of common bodily sensations than the comparison group although the two groups did not differ in their somatic attributions given a common bodily sensation and an accompanying pathological explanation the frequent attenders were less able than the control group to generate reasons why the given explanation might be untrue some associations were found between these measures and anxiety,0,0

stroke differential regulation of thrombospondin1 and thrombospondin2 after focal cerebral ischemiareperfusion angiogenesis occurs after cerebral ischemia and the extent of angiogenesis has been correlated with survival in stroke patients however postischemic angiogenesis is shortlived and may be completely terminated within a few weeks after ischemic insult the molecular mechanism underlying the dissolution of postischemic angiogenic processes is poorly understood although the expression of angiogenic genes has been studied in ischemic stroke models the activation of angiostatic genes after cerebral ischemia has not been investigated thrombospondin tsp1 and tsp2 are naturally occurring angiostatic factors which inhibit angiogenesis in vivo the aim of the present study was to explore the expression of tsp1 and tsp2 in relation to the evolution of angiogenic process in a focal ischemia model in rats	rats underwent cortical ischemia in the middle cerebral artery territory for 60 minutes and reperfusion for up to 2 weeks northern and western blot analysis were used to study the temporal profile of tsp1 and tsp2 expression at the mrna and protein level respectively in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies were used to examine the spatial expression patterns double immunostaining was applied to define the cellular origins of tsp1 and tsp2	a biphasic expression of tsp1 was noted after ischemia peaking at 1 and 72 hours endothelial cells in the leptomeninges were the only source of the first tsp1 peak whereas endothelial glial neuronal and macrophage cells contributed to the second peak of tsp1 expression tsp2 expression occurred much later and in a monophasic manner peaking 2 weeks after ischemia tsp2 immunoreactivity was observed in endothelial neuronal and macrophage but not glial cells tsp1 was expressed before the peak of angiogenesis whereas robust tsp2 expression occurred at the peak of angiogenesis and continued into the period when angiogenesis had completely resolved	robust expression of tsp1 and tsp2 2 major angiostatic factors was noted in the ischemic brain with different temporal expression profiles from different cellular origins the expression of these angiostatic factors especially tsp2 likely contributes to the spontaneous resolution of postischemic angiogenesis further studies are needed to explore the molecular mechanisms that regulate the balance of angiogenic and angiostatic factors in the ischemic brain,1,5

european journal of neurology brainstem in machadojoseph disease atrophy or small size machadojoseph disease mjd one of the most common types of hereditary spinocerebellar degeneration caused by abnormal expansion of the cag repeat in the mjd1 gene presents atrophy of the infratentorial structures neuropathologically and neuroradiologically although a significant positive correlation has been reported between infratentorial atrophy and the number of expanded cag repeat units the exact changing course of brainstem size in the individual case remains to be resolved we investigated seven cases of genetically confirmed mjd longitudinally by magnetic resonance imaging with observation periods of 45106 years measurement of the midsagittal areas of infratentorial structures disclosed progressive atrophy of the pontine base and cerebellum which correlated significantly with age whilst midbrain and pontine tegmentum showed atrophy with no significant progression suggesting it was better identified as small size and might have mostly been completed before the initial symptoms such differences between regions in atrophy progression must be caused by a difference in the neuropathological course,0,0
neurosurgery predifferentiated brainderived adult human progenitor cells migrate toward ischemia after transplantation to the adult rat brain the adult human brain contains neural stemprogenitor cells ahnpcs that can survive transplantation into the adult rat brain migrate toward a lesion and display limited neuronal differentiation in vivo	to investigate the effect of manipulating ahnpcs before grafting by predifferentiation ie initiating neuronal differentiation before transplantation and to determine whether this cell priming would affect their ability to migrate in vivo	ahnpcs were prepared from temporal lobe resections for epilepsy seven days after global brain ischemia predifferentiated ahnpcs exposed to basic fibroblast growth factor heparin and laminin were transplanted to the left hippocampus four and 10 weeks after transplantation brain sections were analyzed by immunohistochemistry	transplanted primed cells expressed committed neuronal markers at a much earlier stage compared with nonprimed ahnpcs and were found colabeled with human markers within the damaged ca1 region 4 weeks after grafting furthermore predifferentiated ahnpcs migrated preferentially into an ischemic lesion similar to their undifferentiated counterparts the chemoattractant effect from the expression of stromal cellderived factor1 sdf1 in ischemic ca1 on ahnpcs expressing cxc chemokine receptor 4 cxcr4 may explain this preference in migration in vivo	the plasticity of neural progenitors derived from the adult human brain may be greater than previously assumed in that manipulation before grafting may influence the phenotypes seen in vivo the sdf1cxcr4 axis is involved in the targeted migration toward an ischemic lesion in the adult rat brain similar to previous reports on endogenous progenitors in rats and grafted fetal human neural progenitors,1,10

neurobiology of aging interferongammadependent cytotoxic activation of human astrocytes and astrocytoma cells astrocytes and microglia become activated in a broad spectrum of inflammatory neurodegenerative diseases activated microglia are widely believed to be the principal source of inflammationinduced neuronal degeneration in these disorders to investigate the neurotoxic potential of human astrocytes we exposed them and human astrocytic u373 mg cells to a variety of inflammatory stimulants we then assessed the effects of their supernatants on human shsy5 cells when astrocytes and u373 mg cells were stimulated with interferon ifngamma 150uml their supernatants significantly reduced shsy5y cell viability other powerful inflammatory stimulants such as lipopolysaccharide 05mugml tumor necrosis factoralpha 10ngml and interleukin1beta 10ngml alone or in combination were without effect these combinations were also unable to enhance the ifngamma effect the induced cytotoxicities were reversed by jak inhibitor i a potent and specific inhibitor of jaks this result indicates that the neurotoxic effect was proceeding through the ifngamma receptor ifngrjakstat intracellular pathway to establish that the ifngr is expressed on both cultured astrocytes and u373 mg cells we performed rtpcr on total rna extracts to identify a specific ifngr product we showed the protein product on these cultured cells by immunocytochemistry using an antibody to ifngr finally using human postmortem material we showed sharp upregulation of the ifngr on activated astrocytes in affected areas in alzheimers disease parkinsons disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and multiple sclerosis these findings suggest that activated astrocytes may become neurotoxic when stimulated by ifngamma and may therefore exacerbate the pathology in a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases,0,8
the american journal of clinical nutrition the effect of oral copper loading and portasystemic shunting on the distribution of copper in the liver brain kidney and cornea of the rat in wilsons disease redistribution of copper from the liver to extrahepatic tissue coincides with the development of liver disease and cirrhosis we have considered the possibility that portasystemic shunting may be a factor determining the organ distribution of copper in patients with liver disease thirtytwo spraguedawley rats were randomized into a shamoperated group and a group subjected to partial occlusion of the portal vein ppvo half the rats in each group were fed on normal diet and the remainder had copper added to the drinking water rats subjected to ppvo developed large portasystemic shunts over a 3month period none of the groups showed an increase in serum copper concentrations or copper oxidase levels liver and kidney copper concentrations were similarly increased in copper supplemented shamoperated and ppvo rats but brain copper content in both groups was similar to the unsupplemented controls in neither unsupplemented nor copper supplemented rats subjected to ppvo was the organ distribution of copper different from shamoperated controls this study suggests that portasystemic shunting does not alter the organ distribution or tissue concentration of copper,1,5
psychiatry research dissociating effects of spatial learning from locomotor activity for ouabaininduced bipolar disorderlike rats whether ouabain a na  and kactivated adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor mimics cognitive impairments that can be dissociated from motor effects in the bipolar disorderlike animal model remains unclear ouabain and the vehicle acsf were microinjected into the left lateral ventricle immediately after 4h and after 24h the results showed that a locomotion responses of the immediate group were significantly decreased compared to those of the acsf group particularly the first five minutes b the ouabaintreated rats have longer latency and total distance traveled in the water maze task however the velocity was not affected for the ouabain group c the analysis of covariance showed that the latency time but not the total distance traveled and velocity of the ouabain group was more impaired than that of the acsf group regardless of omitting total distance traveled and cross movement in the open field test the latency might be more sensitive than the distance traveled and the velocity for assessing spatial learning dissociating the spatial learning from the movement may allow testing drug treatments of cognitive deficits independent of locomotor effects associated with bipolar disorder,1,5
alzheimer disease and associated disorders what correlates with the intention to be tested for mild cognitive impairment mci in healthy older adults our purpose was to determine the factors that correlate with healthy older adults intention to get tested for mild cognitive impairment mci under 3 different hypothetical conditions 1 if they noticed they were having memory problems 2 if a family member suggested that they are having memory problems or 3 as part of a regular medical examination older adults were recruited from the waiting rooms of 2 geriatrics outpatient clinics for facetoface interviews regarding their interest in being screened for mci a short description of mci adapted from the alzheimers associations fact sheet was presented before asking about mci testing multivariable ordinal regression was used to account for heavily skewed outcome data showing very high levels of interest in screening for mci the strongest most consistent correlate across all of the intention measures was the desire to know as early as possible if one has alzheimer disease another robust correlate was having had normal memory testing in the past older adults appear to have psychologically connected mci to alzheimer disease but how well they understand this connection is not known and requires further study,0,0

journal of inherited metabolic disease agat gamt and slc6a8 distribution in the central nervous system in relation to creatine deficiency syndromes a review creatine deficiency syndromes either due to agat gamt or slc6a8 deficiencies lead to a complete absence or a very strong decrease of creatine within the brain as measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy while the mammalian central nervous system cns expresses agat gamt and slc6a8 the lack of slc6a8 in astrocytes around the bloodbrain barrier limits the brain capacity to import creatine from the periphery and suggests that the cns has to rely mainly on endogenous creatine synthesis through agat and gamt expression this seems contradictory with slc6a8 deficiency which despite agat and gamt expression also leads to creatine deficiency in the cns we present novel data showing that in cortical grey matter agat and gamt are expressed in a dissociated way eg only a few cells coexpress both genes this suggests that to allow synthesis of creatine within the cns at least for a significant part of it guanidinoacetate must be transported from agat to gamtexpressing cells possibly through slc6a8 this would explain the creatine deficiency observed in slc6a8deficient patients by bringing together creatine deficiency syndromes agat gamt and slc6a8 distribution in cns as well as a synthetic view on creatine and guanidinoacetate levels in the brain this review presents a comprehensive framework including new hypotheses on brain creatine metabolism and transport both in normal conditions and in case of creatine deficiency,0,1

scientific reports central tendency effects in time interval reproduction in autism central tendency the tendency of judgements of quantities lengths durations etc to gravitate towards their mean is one of the most robust perceptual effects a bayesian account has recently suggested that central tendency reflects the integration of noisy sensory estimates with prior knowledge representations of a mean stimulus serving to improve performance the process is flexible so prior knowledge is weighted more heavily when sensory estimates are imprecise requiring more integration to reduce noise in this study we measure central tendency in autism to evaluate a recent theoretical hypothesis suggesting that autistic perception relies less on prior knowledge representations than typical perception if true autistic children should show reduced central tendency than theoretically predicted from their temporal resolution we tested autistic and age and abilitymatched typical children in two childfriendly tasks 1 a time interval reproduction task measuring central tendency in the temporal domain and 2 a time discrimination task assessing temporal resolution central tendency reduced with age in typical development while temporal resolution improved autistic children performed far worse in temporal discrimination than the matched controls computational simulations suggested that central tendency was much less in autistic children than predicted by theoretical modelling given their poor temporal resolution,0,0

the american journal of pathology induction of pathogenic sets of genes in macrophages and neurons in neuroaids the etiology of the central nervous system cns alterations after human immunodeficiency virus hiv infection such as dementia and encephalitis remains unknown we have used microarray analysis in a monkey model of neuroaids to identify 98 genes many previously unrecognized in lentiviral cns pathogenesis whose expression is significantly upregulated in the frontal lobe of simian immunodeficiency virusinfected brains further through immunohistochemical illumination distinct classes of genes were found whose protein products localized to infiltrating macrophages endothelial cells and resident glia such as cd163 glut5 and isg15 in addition we found proteins induced in cortical neurons ie cyclin d3 tissue transglutaminase alpha1antichymotrypsin and stat1 which have not previously been described as participating in simian immunodeficiency virus or hivrelated cns pathology this molecular phenotyping in the infected brains revealed pathways promoting entry of macrophages into the brain and their subsequent detrimental effects on neurons these data support the hypothesis that in hivinduced cns disease products of activated macrophages and astrocytes lead to cns dysfunction by directly damaging neurons as well as by induction of altered gene and protein expression profiles in neurons themselves which are deleterious to their function,1,5
childs nervous system  chns  official journal of the international society for pediatric neurosurgery methods of monitoring brain oxygenation posttraumatic brain ischemia or hypoxia is a major potential cause of secondary injury that may lead to poor outcome avoidance or amelioration of this secondary injury depends on early diagnosis and intervention before permanent injury occurs however tools to monitor brain oxygenation continuously in the neurointensive care unit have been lacking	in recent times methods of monitoring aspects of brain oxygenation continuously by the bedside have been evaluated in several experimental and clinical series and are potentially changing the way we manage headinjured patients these monitors have the potential to alert the clinician to possible secondary injury and enable intervention help interpret pathophysiological changes eg hyperemia causing raised intracranial pressure monitor interventions eg hyperventilation for increased intracranial pressure and prognosticate this review focuses on jugular venous saturation brain tissue oxygen tension and nearinfrared spectroscopy as practical methods that may have an important role in managing patients with brain injury with a particular focus on the available evidence in children however to use these monitors effectively and to understand the studies in which these monitors are employed it is important for the clinician to appreciate the technical characteristics of each monitor as well as respective strengths and limitations of each it is equally important that the clinician understands relevant aspects of brain oxygen physiology and head trauma pathophysiology to enable correct interpretation of the monitored data and therefore to direct an appropriate therapeutic response that is likely to benefit not harm the patient,0,1

translational psychiatry brain dynamics the temporal variability of connectivity and differences in schizophrenia and adhd we describe advances in the understanding of brain dynamics that are important for understanding the operation of the cerebral cortex in health and disease in data from 1017 participants from the human connectome project we show that early visual and connected areas have low temporal variability of their functional connectivity we show that a low temporal variability of the connectivity of cortical areas is related to high mean functional connectivity between those areas and provide an account of how these dynamics arise we then investigate how these concepts help to understand brain dynamics in mental disorders we find that in both first episode and longterm schizophrenia reduced functional connectivity of early visual and related temporal cortex areas is associated with increased temporal variability of the functional connectivity consistent with decreased stability of attractor networks related to sensory processing in adhd we find these functional connectivities are increased and their temporal variability is decreased and relate this to increased engagement with visual sensory input as manifest in high screen time usage in adhd we further show that these differences in the dynamics of the cortex in schizophrenia and adhd can be related to differences in the functional connectivity of the specific sensory vs association thalamic nuclei these discoveries help to advance our understanding of cortical operation in health and in some mental disorders,0,0

international clinical psychopharmacology highquality remission potential benefits of the melatonergic approach for patients with major depressive disorder full remission of symptoms is the goal for the acute treatment of depression because incomplete remission is associated with poor outcomes including higher risk of relapse and chronicity the current definitions for remission eg a score of 7 on the hamilton depression rating scale however allow for the presence of residual symptoms of depression even if remission is attained the focus now is on the quality of remission that is ensuring a minimum of such residual symptoms because the consequences of lowquality remission also include impairment in psychosocial functioning the most common residual symptoms are sleep disturbances fatigue and disinterest sleepassociated residual symptoms are particularly common and are a major concern because most current treatments fail to adequately address sleep disturbances and may even aggravate them other side effects of current treatments such as weight gain and sexual dysfunction may also reduce the quality of remission a novel approach to the treatment of depression with agomelatine a melatonergic mt1 and mt2 receptor agonist and 5ht2c receptor antagonist may be an effective treatment that improves the quality of remission as it combines good efficacy with positive effects on sleep neutral effects on sexual function and a favorable side effect profile,0,1

acta neurochirurgica carotid endarterectomy a new technique replacing internal shunts carotid endarterectomy has been reported to increase the time free from cerebral ischemic events in both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with a high grade of stenosis of the internal carotid artery in cases in whom the compensatory circulation during the carotid clamp time is not sufficient the use of intraluminal shunts has been proposed however the use of intraluminal shunts present several problems such as the technical difficulties in positioning the shunt the variability of time requested for the placement the inconstancy of the blood flow during surgery and the need to clamp off the carotid to introduce and remove the shunt for these reasons most operators prefer not to employ intraluminal shunts while others do use them only in selected cases the purpose of this work is to present for the first time a new type of temporary extraluminal shunt connecting the femoral to the internal carotid artery with the interposition of a roller pump to regulate the blood flow this method allows one to perform carotid endarterectomy without interrupting the blood flow to the brain	407 consecutive patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy between august 1992 and april 2000 were considered 35 patients presented an absolutely insufficient collateral circulation demonstrated by important modifications of the electroencephalographic monitoring during the carotid clamp time in these patients the endarterectomy was performed using a new femoralcarotid extraluminal shunt	in all the cases in whom the femoralcarotid extraluminal shunt was positioned the normalisation of electroencephalographic monitoring was achieved by regulating the blood flow with the interposed roller pump the use and the placement of the shunt was simple and easy none of the patients showed postoperative complications except for one who had a stroke two days after surgery	the results obtained although to be confirmed by further studies seem to demonstrate the effectiveness of our femoralcarotid extraluminal shunt which was simple to use and safe,0,2

continuum minneapolis minn spontaneous intracranial hypotension spontaneous intracranial hypotension is a disorder caused by spinal csf leakage this article reviews the clinical presentation diagnosis and treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension	the hallmark symptom of spontaneous intracranial hypotension is acute orthostatic headache however clinical presentations can be heterogeneous new evidence shows that lumbar puncture is not always necessary or sufficient to establish the diagnosis some patients may have normal opening pressure which suggests that insufficiency of csf volume hypovolemia rather than csf pressure might be the underlying mechanism several neuroimaging modalities can aid in diagnosis and localization of the csf leakage including brain mri spinal mri ct myelography digital subtraction myelography and radionuclide cisternography complications such as subdural hematoma can lead to a change in the headache pattern and potentially lifethreatening consequences conservative treatments such as fluid supplementation can provide temporary relief however epidural blood patches especially targeted ones are more effective and definitive for patients with refractory spontaneous intracranial hypotension surgical repair of spinal csf leakages should be considered	brain and spinal mris are important for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with spontaneous intracranial hypotension early treatment with epidural blood patches may be considered to shorten the disease duration and minimize the potential risk of complications,0,1

journal of neurosurgery systematic histopathological analysis of different 5aminolevulinic acidinduced fluorescence levels in newly diagnosed glioblastomas objective glioblastoma gbm is characterized by distinct intratumoral histopathological heterogeneity with regard to variable tumor morphology cell proliferation and microvascularity maximum resection of a gbm results in an improved prognosis and thus represents the aim of surgery in the majority of cases fluorescenceguided surgery using 5aminolevulinic acid 5ala is currently widely applied for improved intraoperative tumor visualization in patients with a gbm three intratumoral fluorescence levels ie strong vague or no fluorescence can usually be distinguished during surgery so far however their exact histopathological correlates and their surgical relevance have not been clarified sufficiently thus the aim of this study was to systematically analyze tissue samples from newly diagnosed gbms with different fluorescence levels according to relevant histopathological parameters methods this prospective study recruited patients who underwent 5ala fluorescenceguided resection of a newly diagnosed radiologically suspected gbm each patient received 5ala approximately 3 hours before surgery and a modified neurosurgical microscope was applied for intraoperative visualization of 5alainduced fluorescence during surgery tissue samples with strong vague or no fluorescence were collected for each sample the presence of tumor tissue quality of tissue compact infiltrative or no tumor histopathological criteria of malignancy cell density nuclear pleomorphism mitotic activity and presence of microvascular proliferationnecrosis proliferation rate mib1 labeling index li and microvessel density using cd34 staining were investigated results altogether 77 patients with a newly diagnosed histopathologically confirmed gbm were included and 131 samples with strong fluorescence 69 samples with vague fluorescence and 67 samples with no fluorescence were collected tumor tissue was detected in all 131 100 of the samples with strong fluorescence and in 65 94 of the 69 samples with vague fluorescence however mostly infiltrative tumor tissue was still found in 33 49 of 67 samples despite their lack of fluorescence strong fluorescence corresponded to compact tumors in 109 83 of 131 samples whereas vague fluorescence was consistent with infiltrative tumors in 44 64 of 69 samples in terms of the histopathological criteria of malignancy a significant positive correlation of all analyzed parameters comprising cell density nuclear pleomorphism mitotic activity microvascular proliferation and necrosis with the 3 fluorescence levels was observed p  0001 furthermore the proliferation rate significantly and positively correlated with strong mib1 li 283 vague mib1 li 167 and no mib1 li 88 fluorescence p  0001 last a significantly higher microvessel density was detected in samples with strong fluorescence cd34 1255 vessels025 mm2 than in those with vague cd34 828 vessels025 mm2 or no cd34 686 vessels025 mm2 fluorescence p  0001 conclusions strong and vague 5alainduced fluorescence enables visualization of intratumoral areas with specific histopathological features and thus supports neurosurgeons in improving the extent of resection in patients with a newly diagnosed gbm despite the lack of fluorescence tumor tissue was still observed in approximately half of the cases to overcome this current limitation the promising approach of complementary spectroscopic measurement of fluorescence should be investigated further,0,0
brain research intracarotid injection of granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor induces neuroprotection in a rat transient middle cerebral artery occlusion model granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor gmcsf was found to promote collateral flow in patients with coronary artery disease and also to induce arteriogenesis in a rat hypoperfusion brain model activated macrophages have been shown to induce vascular proliferation and play an important role in ischemic stroke in this study we examined the therapeutic effect of gmcsf on the ischemic brain by activating microgliamacrophages rats were subjected to 1h intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion mcao and received an intracarotid injection of gmcsf 5 ng or saline immediately after reperfusion infarct volume neurological function and histological findings were assessed 48 h later an intracarotid injection of gmcsf reduced the infarct volume and improved neurological function at 48 h after reperfusion histological analysis revealed that the number of activated microgliamacrophages to be increased and the number of apoptotic cells to be decreased in the area of the penumbra these results suggest that intracarotid injection of gmcsf may have a therapeutic effect on brain ischemia via activation of microgliamacrophages,1,6
gene a 5methylcytosine hotspot responsible for the prevalent hsd17b10 mutation approximately half of the cases of hydroxysteroid 17 dehydrogenase x hsd10 deficiency are due to a missense ct mutation in exon 4 of the hsd17b10 gene the resulting hsd10 pr130c loses most or all catalytic functions and the males with this mutation have a much more severe clinical phenotype than those carrying pv65a pl122v or pe249q mutations we found that the mutated cytosine which is 2259 nucleotide from the atg of the gene is 90 methylated in both the active and inactive x chromosomes in two normal females as well as in the x chromosome of a normal male since 5methylcytosine is prone to conversion to thymine by deamination the methylation of this cytosine in normal x chromosomes provides an explanation for the prevalence of the pr130c mutation among patients with hsd10 deficiency the substitution of arginine for cysteine eliminates several hydrogen bonds and reduces the van der waals interaction between hsd10 subunits the resulting disruption of protein structure impairs some if not all of the catalytic and nonenzymatic functions of hsd10 a metaanalysis of residual hsd10 activity in eight patients with the pr130c mutation showed an average 2methyl3hydroxybutyrylcoa dehydrogenase mhbd activity of only 6 5  of the normal control level this is significantly lower than in cells of patients with other clinically milder mutations and suggests that the loss of hsd10mhbd activity is a marker for the disorder,0,0

journal of neuroscience research parenchymal pericytes are not the major contributor of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic scar after stroke in male mice scar formation after injury of the brain or spinal cord is a common event while glial scar formation by astrocytes has been extensively studied much less is known about the fibrotic scar in particular after stroke plateletderived growth factor receptor expressing pdgfr pericytes have been suggested as a source of the fibrotic scar depositing fibrous extracellular matrix ecm proteins after detaching from the vessel wall however to what extent these parenchymal pdgfr cells contribute to the fibrotic scar and whether targeting these cells affects fibrotic scar formation in stroke is still unclear here we utilize male transgenic mice that after a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model have a shift from a parenchymal to a perivascular location of pdgfr cells due to the loss of regulator of gprotein signaling 5 in pericytes we find that only a small fraction of parenchymal pdgfr cells colabel with type i collagen and fibronectin consequently a reduction in parenchymal pdgfr cells by ca 50 did not affect the overall type i collagen or fibronectin deposition after stroke the redistribution of pdgfr cells to a perivascular location however resulted in a reduced thickening of the vascular basement membrane and changed the temporal dynamics of glial scar maturation after stroke we demonstrate that parenchymal pdgfr cells are not the main contributor to the fibrotic ecm and therefore targeting these cells might not impact on fibrotic scar formation after stroke,1,5

journal of clinical hypertension common carotid blood flow in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery common carotid blood flow has been measured using pulsed doppler techniques in hypertensive patients over 45 years of age with and without stenosis of the internal carotid artery in hypertensive patients without stenosis arterial diameter remained within the normal range whereas blood flow velocity and blood flow were significantly reduced vascular resistance was significantly increased but did not change markedly after administration of the vasodilating drug isosorbid dinitrate patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery were compared with two different populations used as controls in comparison with hypertensive patients without stenosis of the internal carotid artery both arterial diameter and blood flow velocity were reduced leading to a more pronounced decrease in blood flow and in comparison with normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery common carotid blood flow was more reduced at any degree of stenosis in a subset of patients blood flow returned toward normal ranges after endarterectomy the study suggested that in patients with hypertension without stenosis of the internal carotid artery the decrease in blood flow is due to a decrease in blood flow velocity with normal arterial diameter despite the elevated blood pressure and in patients with hypertension and stenosis of the internal carotid artery blood flow was more reduced than in the normotensive patients with stenosis of the internal carotid artery suggesting that caution must be taken with indications of antihypertensive treatment,0,0

the canadian journal of cardiology adopting the new anticoagulants all aboard or all in good time at last there is now more than 1 oral anticoagulant oac available for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation though more choice is a good thing it does mandate knowing which drug is the most appropriate in a given clinical situation three novel oacsdabigatran rivaroxaban and apixabanare approved for use in atrial fibrillation in canada they have each been evaluated in large randomized controlled trials where they have been shown to be noninferior or in some cases superior to warfarin coumadin prescription coverage for these drugs is increasingly available through third party and government drug plans the major enhancements of the novel oacs relate to their rapid consistent anticoagulant effect at fixed dosing and the lack of need for monitoring of anticoagulant effect nonetheless their use is not foolproof and practitioners must be familiar with their limitations on balance we favour the use of novel oacs over warfarin in patients who are anticoagulantnaive given their increased ease of use however we advocate switching from warfarin only if international normalized ratio control has been poor or if frequent monitoring is problematic,0,1

folia medica traumatic intracerebral hematomasdiagnostic and therapeutic problem a retrospective analysis was performed of 79 patients with hematomas treated surgically or conservatively the surgical modality was most often opted for in the following cases patients with hematomas exceeding 4 cm in diameter patients with hematomas causing a pronounced dislocation of cerebral structures patients with multiple hematomas that can be accessed through a bone flap hematomas smaller than 4 cm in diameter as well as those located in several brain regions were found to tend easily to resorption at the control computer tomography due to which we preferred treating them using conservative therapeutic methods this therapeutic approach to the patients with hematomas is supported by the statistical analysis comparison of the groups of survivors and nonsurvivors shows that the former predominated in cases of hematomas located in the frontal lobe the latter are predominant when the hematomas are located in the temporal lobe of the brain there was no difference between the groups of surgically and conservatively treated patients with respect to the outcome of the disease if it is improvement or death in the group of patients who underwent conservative treatment there was a predominance of those patients that showed no improvement of the initial state the following conclusions can be made 1 surgical treatment is most often administered to patients with hematomas greater than 4 cm in diameter and hematomas causing dislocation of the cerebral structures 2 the patients at highest risk for adverse outcome are those with temporal location of the hematoma,0,2
preventive medicine predictors and reasons for relapse in smoking cessation with nicotine and placebo patches the reasons for relapse to smoking are not fully understood but several factors are of importance addiction to nicotine seems to play a prominent role but there are several other contributing factors	to determine predictors of outcome in smoking cessation we performed univariate and multivariate analyses in a large smoking cessation trial comprising 289 subjects weight gain and withdrawal symptoms were analyzed separately as predictors to determine selfperceived reasons for relapse we created a questionnaire which was answered by 132 relapsers	previous attempts to quit smoking and a low saliva cotinine concentration were significantly associated with abstinence in the nicotinetreated group a trend toward higher abstinence rates was found among males and among subjects with a low nicotine dependency score logistic regression analysis showed higher success rates in subjects with the largest weight gain during the first weeks of quitting in contrast to higher relapse rates in subjects who had the greatest weight gain after 3 months a high score on withdrawal symptoms was not predictive of relapse subjects with slips had a markedly increased relapse rate craving for cigarettes was the most often selfreported 48 reason for relapse	the relation between weight gain withdrawal scoring and outcome seems rather complex craving for cigarettes was the most reported reason for relapse,0,0

alzheimer disease and associated disorders computerbased cognitive training for mild cognitive impairment results from a pilot randomized controlled trial we performed a pilot randomized controlled trial of intensive computerbased cognitive training in 47 subjects with mild cognitive impairment the intervention group performed exercises specifically designed to improve auditory processing speed and accuracy for 100 mind 5 dwk for 6 weeks the control group performed more passive computer activities reading listening visuospatial game for similar amounts of time subjects had a mean age of 74 years and 60 were men 77 successfully completed training on our primary outcome repeatable battery for assessment of neuropsychological status total scores improved 036 standard deviations sd in the intervention group p0097 compared with 003 sd in the control group p088 for a nonsignificant difference between the groups of 033 sd p026 on 12 secondary outcome measures most differences between the groups were not statistically significant however we observed a pattern in which effect sizes for verbal learning and memory measures tended to favor the intervention group whereas effect sizes for language and visuospatial function measures tended to favor the control group which raises the possibility that these training programs may have domainspecific effects we conclude that intensive computerbased mental activity is feasible in subjects with mild cognitive impairment and that larger trials are warranted,0,9
sensors basel switzerland utility of the full ecg waveform for stress classification the detection of psychological stress using the electrocardiogram ecg signal is most commonly based on the detection of the r peakthe most prominent part of the ecg waveformand the heart rate variability hrv measurements derived from it for stress detection algorithms focused on shortduration time windows there is potential benefit in including hrv features derived from the detection of smaller peaks within the ecg waveform the p q s and t waves however the potential drawback of using these small peaks is their smaller magnitude and subsequent susceptibility to noise making them more difficult to reliably detect in this work we demonstrate the potential benefits of including smaller waves within binary stress classification using a preexisting data set of ecg recordings from 57 participants aged 1840 with a selfreported fear of spiders during exposure to videos of spiders we also present an analysis of the performance of an automated peak detection algorithm and the reliability of detection for each of the smaller parts of the ecg waveform we compared two models one with only r peak features and one with small peak features they were similar in precision recall f1 area under roc curve auc and accuracy with the greatest differences less than the standard deviations of each metric there was a significant difference in the akaike information criterion aic which represented the information loss of the model the inclusion of novel small peak features made the model 4291028 times more probable to minimize the information loss and the small peak features showed higher regression coefficients than the r peak features indicating a stronger relationship with acute psychological stress this difference and further analysis of the novel features suggest that small peak intervals could be indicative of independent processes within the heart reflecting a psychophysiological response to stress that has not yet been leveraged in stress detection algorithms,0,0

social psychiatry and psychiatric epidemiology community attitudes toward and knowledge of mental illness in south africa although recent advances in psychiatry have increased our understanding of psychiatric disordersmany people with chronic or severe psychiatric disorders may be unaware that effective treatment is available it is possible that ignorance and stigma prevent such persons from seeking appropriate help and that community attitudes and beliefs play a role in determining the helpseeking behaviour and successful treatment of the mentally ill nevertheless there is little research on the attitudes of lay persons toward mental illness within the south african community	the aim of this study was to investigate the knowledge and attitudes of the general south african public toward mental illness specifically regarding the causes of illness and treatment options	the study design employed a questionnaire survey structured interviews n  667 were conducted with members of the general public one of eight vignettes portraying depression schizophrenia panic disorder or substance abuse with subtle or obvious symptoms was presented to each respondent	the main findings were that cases were most often conceptualised as stressrelated or due to a lack of willpower rather than as medical disorders treatment advocated was more often to talk the problem over than to consult professional medical help psychotherapy was the preferred treatment option particularly in vignettes where symptom presentation was subtle and in cases of substance abuse	these data suggest that stigma and misinformation regarding mental illness exist influencing preferred treatment modality and helpseeking behaviour more work needs to be done to educate the public about the psychobiological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders and about the value of effective treatments a better understanding of these disorders amongst the public would presumably lessen stigmatisation and encourage the use of currently available and effective interventions,0,0

the journal of the american academy of psychiatry and the law pathological lying revisited although pathological lying was first described in the medical literature over 100 years ago it remains a poorly understood concept psychiatrists continue to grapple with the full ramifications of the condition even though interest specifically in pathological lying seems to have waned in recent times the impact of pathological lying deserves critical attention from forensic psychiatrists because of the implications that untruths have in a legal context in this article the authors review the considerable vagueness and confusion that has surrounded this concept and examine the extent to which a person can control lying behavior and the related question of whether pathological liars have responsibility for their actions while providing a structured framework for considering pathological lying in the forensic context the authors conclude that further systematic research is needed to resolve the questions raised in this article,0,1

lencephale acute catatonia questions diagnosis and prognostics and the place of atypical antipsychotics acute catatonia is a nonspecific relatively frequent syndrome which manifests itself through characteristic motor signs that enables its diagnosis it occurs in association with mood disorders psychotic disorders and several somatic or toxic diseases its shortterm prognosis is of paramount importance without effective treatment it is associated with high mortality despite the vital risk inherent in this disorder it is not recognized as an independent diagnostic category by international rankings which makes its diagnostic detection difficult and consequently does not allow adequate therapeutic care however if benzodiazepines and electroconvulsive therapy have proved effective in the treatment of acute catatonia the role of atypical antipsychotics remains controversial in fact despite the progress made by the dsmivtr and cim 10 by the recognition of the etiologic diversity of catatonia we deplore the absence to date of a consensus on clinical management and therapy of catatonia which constitutes a source of confusion for practitioners in their approach to catatonic patients to illustrate the difficulty in supporting these patients we report here a clinical vignette	mr m aged 21 without psychiatric history has shown a functional acute psychotic episode involving a delirious and hallucinatory syndrome associated with a marked catatonic dimension olanzapine was initiated at a dose of 10mgd on the nineth day of hospitalization the clinical picture was complicated by a malignant catatonia justifying the halt of olanzapine and the institution in intensive units of 15mg per day of lorazepam after 72hours the patient has not responded to this treatment ect was expected but the patient died on the 12th day	this case raises a threefold question the crucial issue of immediate vital prognosis that of the truthfulness of the positive diagnosis of this psychotic table and finally the issue of therapeutic care primarily the wellfounded or otherwise use of an atypical antipsychotic for the treatment of this type of psychotic disorder for mr m the clinical diagnosis that he has shown according to the dsm ivtr is brief psychotic disorder temporary diagnosis this diagnosis  brief psychotic disorder  does not actually allow for a specific clinical approach to this type of psychotic table the immediate vital prognosis inherent in the catatonic dimension may not be properly evaluated and the therapeutic conduct may miss the application of the specific treatment of the catatonic syndrome the proper diagnosis for this type of psychotic disorder would be catatonia as proposed by taylor and fink instead of brief psychotic disorder if the international rankings have included this disorder as a separate and independent diagnosis the identification by international rankings of the catatonic syndrome as an independent diagnostic category seems essential for clinicians to allow its clinical detection the establishment of a syndromic diagnosis of catatonic disorder appropriate prognostic evaluation and finally the application of a suitable therapeutic strategy conventional treatment benzodiazepine andor ectbased can solve the catatonic episode in a few days irrespective of its etiology and its severity moreover while all authors agree that conventional antipsychotics may induce a catatonic state or worsen a preexisting catatonia into a malignant catatonia and should thus be avoided for catatonic patients or with prior catatonic episodes recent data from the literature emphasize the frequent and successful use of atypical antipsychotics including olanzapine in various clinical forms of benign catatonia however our patient did not respond to treatment with olanzapine and got even more complicated was the malignant catatonia that this patient has shown induced by olanzapine  the answer to this question seems difficult since some authors report the efficacy of olanzapine in malignant catatonia we wonder if we should have kept olanzapine and strengthen its dosage like cassidy et al in 2001 and suzuki et al in 2010 for the treatment of the malignant form constituted in this patient rather than having stopped it and used lorazepam as indicated by taylor and fink in 2003	the nonrecognition of catatonia as an independent entity the lack of a therapeutic consensus and the pending issue on the safety and efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in the treatment of catatonia are at the origin of the difficulties of therapeutic support of catatonic patients,0,1
