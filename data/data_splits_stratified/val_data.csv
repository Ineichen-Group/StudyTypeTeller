neurobiology of disease subchronic ketamine treatment leads to permanent changes in eeg cognition and the astrocytic glutamate transporter eaat2 in mice ketamine is an nmda receptor antagonist with psychotomimetic dissociative amnestic and euphoric effects when chronically abused ketamine users display deficits in cognition and information processing even following longterm abstinence from the drug while animal studies have shown evidence of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits that mimic those seen in humans within the period immediately following subchronic ketamine a few animal studies have assessed longterm changes following cessation of ketamine exposure to this end the present study assessed event related potentials erps and eeg oscillations in mice exposed to subchronic ketamine following a 6month period of abstinence from the drug ketaminetreated mice showed no change in p20 but did show marked reductions in amplitude of the later n40 and p80 components consistent with previous studies of acute ketamine exposure additionally ketaminetreated animals showed a significant reduction in stimulus evoked theta oscillations to assess the functional significance of these changes mice were also assessed on a series of behavioral and cognitive tests including progressive ratio motivation extinction behavioral flexibility and winshift radial maze spatial memory subchronic ketamine produced marked disruptions in reversal learning and spatial memory analysis of brains from ketaminetreated mice failed to show evidence of neuronal degeneration as determined by nuen immunohistochemistry but did show increased astrocyte proliferation and decreased expression of the glial specific glutamate transporter glt1 these results strongly suggest 1 that subchronic ketamine induces significant changes in brain function that long exceed exposure to the drug 2 that ketamine exposure in mice induces lasting cognitive impairments closely resembling those observed in human ketamine abusers 3 that erp and eeg measures are highly sensitive to alterations in brain function associated with reduced cognitive function and 4 that the brain changes induced by chronic ketamine treatment are suggestive of longterm adaptive or plastic rather than degenerative changes,1,6
faseb journal  official publication of the federation of american societies for experimental biology macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif is critical for the host resistance against toxoplasma gondii macrophage migration inhibitory factor mif exerts either a protective or a deleterious role in the immune response to different pathogens we analyzed herein the role of mif in the host control of toxoplasmosis using mif mice backcrossed to either the balbc or the c57bl6 genetic backgrounds both wildtype wt balbc and mif balbc mice were susceptible to infection with highly virulent rh as well as moderately virulent me49 strains of t gondii mif mice however showed greater liver damage and more brain cysts produced less proinflammatory cytokines and succumbed significantly faster than wt mice bone marrowderived dendritic cells bmdcs from mif mice produced less interleukin1beta interleukin12 and tumor necrosis factoralpha than wt bmdcs after stimulation with soluble toxoplasma antigen stag similar observations were made in cd11c lowdensity cells isolated from the spleens of mif mice challenged with stag mif c57bl6 mice succumbed to me49 infection faster than their wt counterparts c57bl6 mice that succumbed to infection with the me49 strain produced less mif than resistant balbc mice similarly infected interestingly an analysis of brains from patients with cerebral toxoplasmosis showed low levels of mif expression together these findings demonstrate that mif plays a critical role in mediating host resistance against t gondii,1,5

minerva medica study of mapped slow auditory evoked potentials in alzheimers disease alzheimers disease affects around 500000 persons in italy and its diagnosis remains essentially clinical our aim was to contribute to the diagnosis of alzheimers disease by mapping auditory evoked potentials aep evoked potentials represent the electric response of the cns to an external stimulus and can be represented as a sequence of waves brain mapping allows a chromotopogram to be compiled showing chromatic maps	a group of 12 patients were studied aged between 68 and 84 years old who were referred to our attention at the department of geriatrics and gerontology at catania university and the ao cannizzaro geriatrics unit all patients completed an assessment form mmse adas and underwent brain nmr and aep	these tests enabled us to identify two types of patients group a and group b based on the responses shown the overall evaluation of results revealed that patients with alzheimertype dementia present an anomalous cortical neurogenic response to mapped aep and that patients in group a showed anomalous wave morphology latency and localisation and asymmetric impregnation the data gathered in this study did not confirm any specific characteristics of aep given that similar anomalies are found in metabolic dysfunction syndromes and demyelination pathologies	however while it does not constitute a specific technique for screening against alzheimers disease the mapping of aep may contribute to the diagnosis of this disease,0,0
the american journal of pathology microtubule reduction in alzheimers disease and aging is independent of tau filament formation biochemical studies show that phosphorylated tau like that found in paired helical filaments phfs does not promote microtubule assembly leading to the view that phf formation leads to microtubule deficiency in alzheimers disease ad however although this issue is one of the most important aspects to further understanding the cell biology of ad no quantitative examination of microtubule diminution in ad and its relationship with phfs has been performed to examine this issue directly we undertook a morphometric study of brain biopsy specimens from ad and control cases ultrastructural analysis of neurons was performed to compare the microtubule assembly state in neurons of diseased and control cases and to examine the effect of phf accumulation we found that both number and total length of microtubules were significantly and selectively reduced in pyramidal neurons from ad in comparison to control cases p  0000004 but that this decrement in microtubule density was surprisingly unrelated to phfs p  08 further we found a significant agedependent decrease in microtubule density with aging in the control cases p  0016 these findings suggest that reduction in microtubule assembly is not dependent on tau abnormalities of ad and aging,0,0

vision research disruption of spatial memory in visual search in the left visual field in patients with hemispatial neglect spatial working memory during an ongoing visual search trial was tested in both visual fields for rightbrain damaged patients with contralesional spatial neglect as well as agematched control patients with righthemisphere lesions but no neglect we examined withintrial spatial memory by using a relocation search paradigm introduced by kristjansson 2000 modified from horowitz  wolfe 1998 in which the display items traded places every 110ms so that the target was never to be found in the same location from one moment to the next the relocation condition as compared with a static condition where the display items remained in place for the whole trial duration to equate appearance between the two conditions all items changed orientation every 110ms in both conditions and were masked after each of the briefly presented visual arrays the results showed that search was disrupted by item relocation for both patients and controls but importantly this disruption was only seen in the right visual field for the patients not the left indicating that their spatial working memory in left visual space is already severely disrupted and to a greater degree than for their right visual space in contrast to what has been previously argued,0,0
journal of neurosurgery neuroprotective activity of tamoxifen in permanent focal ischemia the authors have previously shown that tamoxifen is effective in protecting brain tissue from ischemic injury in a rat model of reversible focal ischemia in this study the authors tested whether similar protective effects are found in a rat model of permanent focal ischemia permanent middle cerebral artery mca occlusion	tamoxifen 20 mgkg was given either before or at 1 3 or 6 hours after permanent mca occlusion in rats with sustaining doses given every 12 hours thereafter the median infarct volume measured after 72 hours was 113 mm3 for the vehicle dimethyl sulfoxide groups compared with 31 mm3 for pretreatment and 14 27 and 98 mm3 for treatment beginning at 1 3 and 6 hours respectively after permanent mca occlusion the infarct reductions in the pretreated and 1 and 3hour postmca occlusion treatment groups were statistically significant p  005 at 3 hours after permanent mca occlusion tamoxifen also significantly reduced the infarct size at a lower dose of 5 mgkg but not at 1 mgkg the same sustaining doses of 5 and 1 mgkg were given every 12 hours	tamoxifen is as effective in a permanent model of focal ischemia as it is in the reversible model and the therapeutic window of 3 hours after initiation of ischemia is identical this effectiveness is likely due to several properties of the drug including its known ability to cross the bloodbrain barrier because tamoxifen has been administered safely in humans for treatment of gliomas at similarly high doses to those used in this study it may be clinically useful as a treatment for ischemic stroke,1,6

archives of otolaryngologyhead  neck surgery irradiation a significant risk factor for carotid atherosclerosis radiation exacerbates the development of atherosclerosis in the large arteries of animals and is postulated to do likewise in human beings to study this relationship we used highresolution bmode ultrasonography to measure carotid artery wall thickness in 29 previously irradiated head and neck cancer patients and compared the results with those of nine epidemiologically similar but nonirradiated head and neck cancer patients maximal intimamedia thickness was greater in the study group mean 128  se 006 mm than in the control group mean 090  se 005 mm even after the effects of age hypertension and tobacco consumption were controlled these differences remained statistically significant this study suggests that irradiation may contribute to the development of more severe and extensive carotid atherosclerosis in head and neck cancer patients who receive radiation therapy,0,0
conference proceedings   annual international conference of the ieee engineering in medicine and biology society ieee engineering in medicine and biology society annual conference towards a method to study neurorobotic control in a rat model of spinal cord injury neurorobotic control of prosthetic devices may bea viable therapeutic intervention that provides spinal cord injury patients with the ability to use the neuronal activity of populations of single neurons to control an external device iecursor on a computer screen or robotic arm however we are limited by our understanding of how spinal cord injury alters the ability of these neurons to convey information about the intention to move therefore there is a need to develop animal models that 1 describe how population of single neurons encode information about different behavioral tasks skilled vsunskilled 2 determine how this encoding is modulated by spinal cord injury and 3 perform neurorobotic control after spinal cord injury to address the first question we developed a rat model of spinal cord transection to evaluate the effects of the injury on the neuronal activity related to hindlimb activity the model consists of training the rat to press a pedal with its hindlimbs this paper describes the method that defines both the magnitude and latency of a neurons activity in terms of its perievent histogram relative to the animals movements during the task the method provides a means by which changes in neural activation can be correlated with changes in behavior,1,5
molecules basel switzerland novel and potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for the treatment of alzheimers disease from natural 78dihydroxy3methylisochroman4one alzheimers disease ad is a neurodegenerative disease that causes memory and cognitive decline as well as behavioral problems it is a progressive and well recognized complex disease therefore it is very urgent to develop novel and effective antiad drugs in this study a series of novel isochroman4one derivatives from natural 78dihydroxy3methylisochroman4one xjp were designed and synthesized and their antiad potential was evaluated among them compound 10a z3acetyl1benzyl467dimethoxy4oxoisochroman3ylidenemethylpyridin1ium bromide possessed potent antiacetylcholinesterase ache activity as well as modest antioxidant activity further molecular modeling and kinetic investigations revealed that compound 10a was a dualbinding inhibitor that binds to both catalytic anionic site cas and peripheral anionic site pas of the enzyme ache in addition compound 10a exhibited low cytotoxicity and moderate antia aggregation efficacy moreover the in silico screening suggested that these compounds could pass across the bloodbrain barrier with high penetration these findings show that compound 10a was a promising lead from a natural product with potent ache inhibitory activity and deserves to be further developed for the prevention and treatment of ad,0,8

annals of neurology hippocampal or neocortical lesions on magnetic resonance imaging do not necessarily indicate site of ictal onsets in partial epilepsy advances in neuroimaging techniques particularly highresolution magnetic resonance imaging mri have proved invaluable in identifying structural brain lesions in patients with epilepsy the assumption that such focal lesions invariably predict the site of seizure origin may not be correct however we report a series of 20 adults with medically intractable partial epilepsy where highresolution brain mri disclosed a unilateral focal hippocampal or neocortical lesion as the only abnormality in each case nevertheless based on electroencephalographic eeg recordings ictal onsets arose from a completely different location than that of the mri lesion all patients underwent epilepsy surgery with the operations based on ictal eeg findings and all were followed at least 2 years after the resection after the most recent followup examination 50 1020 of the patients were completely seizurefree 35 720 had at least a 75 reduction in the number of seizures and 15 320 had less than a 75 reduction in the number of seizures we conclude that the identification of a focal structural hippocampal or neocortical lesion on brain mri is not always indicative of the site of seizure origin in partial epilepsy furthermore in cases of discordance between mri and eeg data a good outcome after epilepsy surgery is possible if eeg ictal onsets are definitive,0,0
biochemical and biophysical research communications in yeast redistribution of sod1 to the mitochondrial intermembrane space provides protection against respiration derived oxidative stress the antioxidative enzyme copperzinc superoxide dismutase sod1 is an important cellular defence system against reactive oxygen species ros while the majority of this enzyme is localized to the cytosol about 1 of the cellular sod1 is present in the intermembrane space ims of mitochondria these amounts of mitochondrial sod1 are increased for certain sod1 mutants that are linked to the neurodegenerative disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis als to date only little is known about the physiological function of mitochondrial sod1 here we use the model system saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate cells in which sod1 is exclusively localized to the ims we find that imslocalized sod1 can functionally substitute wild type sod1 and that it even exceeds the protective capacity of wild type sod1 under conditions of mitochondrial ros stress moreover we demonstrate that upon expression in yeast cells the common alslinked mutant sod1g93a becomes enriched in the mitochondrial fraction and provides an increased protection of cells from mitochondrial oxidative stress such an effect cannot be observed for the catalytically inactive mutant sod1g85r our observations suggest that the targeting of sod1 to the mitochondrial ims provides an increased protection against respirationderived ros,0,8

cognition visual perspective taking impairment in children with autistic spectrum disorder evidence from typical development and neuroimaging studies suggests that level 2 visual perspective taking  the knowledge that different people may see the same thing differently at the same time  is a mentalising task thus we would expect children with autism who fail typical mentalising tasks like false belief to perform poorly on level 2 visual perspective taking as well however prior data on this issue are inconclusive we reexamined this question testing a group of 23 young autistic children aged around 8years with a verbal mental age of around 4years and three groups of typical children n60 ranging in age from 4 to 8years on a level 2 visual perspective task and a closely matched mental rotation task the results demonstrate that autistic children have difficulty with visual perspective taking compared to a task requiring mental rotation relative to typical children furthermore performance on the level 2 visual perspective taking task correlated with theory of mind performance these findings resolve discrepancies in previous studies of visual perspective taking in autism and demonstrate that level 2 visual perspective taking is a mentalising task,0,0
american journal of medical genetics evaluation of a screening questionnaire for genetic studies of parkinsons disease a screening questionnaire with high sensitivity for detection of parkinsons disease would make it easier to identify undiagnosed yet affected family members for genetic research we assessed the validity of a screening questionnaire developed by duarte et al 1995 mov disord 10643649 with reported high specificity and sensitivity for parkinsons disease pd we applied the questionnaire to 78 asymptomatic members of families that had at least two people diagnosed with pd these families were participating in a linkage study of parkinsons disease examination of these 78 revealed that 53 were normal normal controls and 25 were classified undiagnosed pd defined as possible probable or clinically definite pd based on standardized criteria we compared these results with 123 patients with clinically definite pd diagnosed pd there were significant differences among the mean scores on the questionnaire for normal controls 44 subjects with undiagnosed pd 98 and patients with diagnosed pd 421 p0000001 and a significant difference between undiagnosed pd and normals p001 the questionnaire had only 4 sensitivity for detection of parkinsonism in undiagnosed pd using the original criteria duarte et al 1995 revising the criteria increased the sensitivity from 4 to 48 in the undiagnosed group the positive predictive value was 39 and the negative predictive value was 72 prospective application of these revised criteria is necessary to confirm the improved sensitivity however we conclude that this screening questionnaire has inadequate sensitivity for detection of mild parkinsonism and direct examination is still critical for accurate classification for genetic studies,0,0

methods in molecular biology clifton nj functional network disruptions in schizophrenia it has been long recognized that schizophrenia unlike certain other mental disorders appears to be delocalized ie difficult to attribute to a dysfunction of a few specific brain areas and may be better understood as a disruption of brains emergent network properties in this chapter we focus on topological properties of functional brain networks obtained from fmri data and demonstrate that some of those properties can be used as discriminative features of schizophrenia in multivariate predictive setting while the prior work on schizophrenia networks has been primarily focused on discovering statistically significant differences in network properties this work extends the prior art by exploring the generalization prediction ability of network models for schizophrenia which is not necessarily captured by such significance tests moreover we show that significant disruption of the topological and spatial structure of functional mri networks in schizophrenia a cannot be explained by a disruption to areabased taskdependent responses ie indeed relates to the emergent properties b is global in nature affecting most dramatically longdistance correlations and c can be leveraged to achieve high classification accuracy 93 when discriminating between schizophrenic vs control subjects based just on a single fmri experiment using a simple auditory task,0,0
schizophrenia bulletin increased cerebellar functional connectivity with the defaultmode network in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients at rest the defaultmode network dmn is vital in the neurobiology of schizophrenia and the cerebellum participates in the highorder cognitive network such as the dmn however the specific contribution of the cerebellum to the dmn abnormalities remains unclear in unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients fortysix unaffected siblings of schizophrenia patients and 46 healthy controls were recruited for a restingstate scan the images were analyzed using the functional connectivity fc method the siblings showed significantly increased fcs between the left crus i and the left superior medial prefrontal cortex mpfc as well as between the lobule ix and the bilateral mpfc orbital part and right superior mpfc compared with the controls no significantly decreased fc was observed in the siblings relative to the controls the analyses were replicated in 49 firstepisode drugnaive patients with schizophrenia and the results showed that the siblings and the patients shared increased fcs between the left crus i and the left superior mpfc as well as between the lobule ix and the left mpfc orbital part compared with the controls these findings suggest that increased cerebellardmn connectivities emerge earlier than illness onset which highlight the contribution of the cerebellum to the dmn alterations in unaffected siblings the shared increased cerebellardmn connectivities between the patients and the siblings may be used as candidate endophenotypes for schizophrenia,0,0
