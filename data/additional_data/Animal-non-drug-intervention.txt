AB  - The effects of methadone and morphine maintenance on morphine self-administration were studied in the dog. Methadone was given passively for 2 weeks by continuous i.v. infusion. The amount of methadone administered daily was the same in mg/kg as the mean daily mg/kg of morphine the dogs had self-administered during the premaintenance control week. Morphine self-administration was markedly reduced initially but returned to normal levels within 2 weeks of methadone administration. Following the methadone maintenance period, morphine self-administration was increased over the premaintenance period for 2 weeks. A result similar to that with methadone was obtained in a second experiment when morphine was used as the maintenance drug in an amount that was three times the amount the dogs had been self-administering during the premaintenance control week.

AB  - Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in Buffalo rats by immunization with syngeneic spinal cord homogenate in complete adjuvant. EAE, an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS), is regarded as a model for multiple sclerosis. When severe paresis had developed, rats were treated with high-dose total body irradiation (TBI) and transplanted with syngeneic BM from healthy donors. Nine Gy TBI followed by syngeneic BMT greatly accelerated recovery of paresis compared with untreated controls. In 6-33% of the treated animals a relapse of EAE was observed shortly after treatment. Reimmunization 20 days after treatment, resulted in a relapse in 12-44% of the rats. Employing the maximally tolerated dose of TBI (10 Gy) did not significantly alter the incidence of spontaneous or induced relapses. Furthermore, it was shown that irradiation of the CNS only was not sufficient for the induction of complete regression of paresis. The origin of the cells responsible for these relapses is discussed, as is the importance of reimmunization in evaluating the effect of treatment of experimental autoimmune disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to elucidate the effect of neurospheres (NS) on dementia in the mouse model of nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM) lesion. METHODS: Mouse embryonic stem cell (ES) derived neurospheres were transplanted into the frontal association cortex and barrel field of S1 cortex of C57BL/6 mice 4 weeks after including a lesion of NBM by ibotenic acid, while other healthy mice that received ES cells served as control. Behavioral tests by 8-arm radial maze were conducted 8 weeks after transplantation, and double staining of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), serotonin, amyloid-beta protein (AP) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) 12 weeks after transplantation. We found that the neurospheres transplanted into the mouse cortex survived and produced many ChAT-positive neurons and a few serotonin-positive neurons in and around the grafts. The working memory error decreased significantly in the mice grafted with neurospheres. In contrast, the ES cells developed into teratomas in all of the control mice and expressed no neurons, and the working memory deteriorated remarkably. CONCLUSIONS: Transplantation of neurospheres, but not ES cells, into the prefrontal and parietal cortices, dramatically alleviated the cholinergic deficits and recent memory disruption in the NBM lesioned mice.

AB  - We studied the influence of Withania somnifera (Ws) root extract (100 mg/kg body weight) on parkinsonism induced by 1-methyl 4-phenyl 1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP; i.p, 20 mg/kg body weight for 4 days), via the analysis of behavioral features and the oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in the midbrain of mice. A significant alteration in behavior, increased levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS), and increased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) were noticed in this region of brain in MPTP-treated mice. Oral treatment with the root extract resulted in a significant improvement in the mice's behavior and antioxidant status, along with a significant reduction in the level of lipid peroxidation. The results indicated that at least part of the chronic stress-induced pathology may be due to oxidative stress, which is mitigated by Ws. Further studies are needed to assess the precise mechanism to support the clinical use of the plant as an antiparkinsonic drug.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The optimal management of spinal column metastatic disease is controversial. Furthermore, the literature lacks an accurate animal model to study the efficacy of surgical treatment options for spinal column metastases. We compared the efficacy of surgery, radiotherapy, or surgery plus adjuvant radiotherapy in a rat model of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression. METHODS: Thirty-two Fischer 344 rats underwent a transabdominal approach for implantation of a CRL-1666 breast adenocarcinoma cell line within the vertebral body of L6. Animals were randomly assigned to receive one of four treatments (n = 8 per group) 7 days after tumor implantation: 1) control: no treatment; 2) external beam radiation therapy (XRT) (total 20 Gy in 400-cGy daily fractions); 3) surgery: L6 vertebral corpectomy, tumor resection, and polymethyl methacrylate reconstruction; and 4) surgery + XRT: corpectomy and tumor resection followed by XRT (total 20 Gy in 400-cGy daily fractions) 72 hours after surgery. Hind-limb function was tested daily after treatment using the Basso-Beattie-Bresnahan (BBB) scale (range, 1-21). RESULTS: All animals (n = 32) demonstrated normal hind-limb function (BBB score, 21) on posttreatment Day 1. The XRT, surgery, and surgery + XRT groups all experienced a delay in onset of paresis versus the control group. Compared to the XRT group, the surgery group demonstrated greater median BBB scores on Days 3 (21 versus 20, P = 0.02) through 9 (12 versus 8, P = 0.002) after treatment. Compared with the surgery group, the surgery + XRT group demonstrated even greater median BBB scores on Days 6 (21 versus 19, P = 0.0008) through 11 (16 versus 8, P = 0.0001) after treatment. Median time to loss of ambulation (BBB <or= 7) was greatest in the surgery + XRT group (15 d) when compared with the surgery (12 d, P = 0.001), XRT (9 d, P = 0.001), or control groups (7 d, P = 0.0005). CONCLUSION: In a rat model of metastatic epidural spinal cord compression, decompressive surgery followed by radiotherapy yielded the greatest efficacy in the prevention of neurological decline when compared with surgery or radiotherapy alone. Radiotherapy alone attenuated neurological decline but was the least efficacious treatment in this model. These results support this animal model as an effective platform to investigate novel interventions for metastatic spine tumors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Therapeutic hypothermia, a safe and effective treatment for neonatal encephalopathy in an intensive care setting, is not available in low-resource settings. Aims/ METHODS: To assess two low-tech, low-cost cooling devices for use in low-resource settings: (i) commercially available water bottles filled with tepid water (25 degrees C); (ii) a mattress made of phase changing material (PCM) with a melting point of 32 degrees C (PCM works as a heat buffer at this temperature). Eleven anaesthetised newborn piglets were studied following transient hypoxia-ischaemia. The cooling device was applied 2-26 h after hypoxia-ischaemia with a target rectal temperature (T(rectal)) of 33-34 degrees C. T(rectal) undershoot was adjusted using cotton blankets; the cooling device was renewed when T(rectal) rose above 35 degrees C. T(rectal) data during cooling were dichotomised (within or without target) to assess: (a) the total period within the target T(rectal) range; (b) the stability and fluctuation of T(rectal) during cooling. RESULTS: Therapeutic hypothermia was achieved with both water bottles (n = 5) and the PCM mattress (n = 6). The mean (SD) time to reach target T(rectal) was 1.8 (0.5) h with water bottles and 1.9 (0.3) h with PCM. PCM cooling led to a longer period within the target T(rectal) range (p<0.01) and more stable cooling (p<0.05). Water bottle cooling required device renewal (in four out of five piglets). CONCLUSION: Simple, low-tech cooling devices can induce and maintain therapeutic hypothermia effectively in a porcine model of neonatal encephalopathy, although frequent fine tuning by adjusting the number of blankets insulating the piglet was required to maintain a stable temperature. PCM may induce more stable cooling compared with water bottles.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Withania somnifera root extract (Ws)/Ashwagandha/Indian ginseng is a traditional herbal medicine, used over 4000 years in India, shown to have effect on neural growth and locomotor function. Although catecholamines and oxidative stress resulting in neurodegeneration and locomotor disorder are the main events in Parkinson's disease (PD), efficacy of the drug on these molecules and physiological abnormality are not clear. AIM OF THE STUDY: The objective of the study was to examine effect of Ws on catecholamines and physiological abnormalities seen in PD using PD model mouse. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Mouse were treated with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) for 4 days to show biochemical and physiological abnormalities similar to patients with PD. PD mice were treated with Ws 100mg/kg body weight for 7 or 28 days. Catecholamines: dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxy-phenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid (HVA); antioxidants: glutathione (GSH) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx); and lipid peroxidation marker (TBARS) were analyzed in the Ws treated and untreated PD mouse striatum. RESULTS: Mouse treated with MPTP showed reduced levels of DA, DOPAC, HVA, GSH and GPx and induced thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBARS) level compared to the control. Physiological abnormalities were seen in the mouse as determined by hang test and rotarod test. Oral treatment of PD mouse Ws root extract (100mg/kg body weight) for 7 days or 28 days increased DA, DOPAC and HVA levels and normalized TBARS levels in the corpus striatum of the PD mouse. The 7 days Ws treated mice showed improved motor function as determined by hang test and rotarod test. Treatment with Ws for 28 days increased GSH and GPx levels in the striatum compared to the Ws untreated PD mouse striatum. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that Ws is a potential drug in treating catecholamines, oxidative damage and physiological abnormalities seen in the PD mouse.

AB  - To investigate whether whole body hypothermia after neonatal cerebral hypoxia-ischemia (HI) could broaden the therapeutic window of intranasal treatment of IGF-1 (iN-IGF-1), postnatal day 7 rat pups were subjected to right common carotid artery ligation, followed by 8% oxygen inhalation for 2h. After HI, one group of pups were returned to their dams and kept at room temperature (24.5±0.2°C). A second group of pups were subjected to whole body hypothermia in a cool environment (21.5±0.3°C) for 2 or 4h before being returned to their dams. Two doses of 50 μg recombinant human IGF-1 were administered intranasally at a 1h interval starting at 0, 2 or 4h after hypothermia. Hypothermia decreased the rectal temperature of pups by 4.5°C as compared to those kept at room temperature. While hypothermia or iN-IGF-1 administered 2h after HI alone did not provide neuroprotection, the combined treatment of hypothermia with iN-IGF-1 significantly protected the neonatal rat brain from HI injury. Hypothermia treatment extended the therapeutic window of IGF-1 to 6h after HI. The extended IGF-1 therapeutic window by hypothermia was associated with decreases in infiltration of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and activation of microglia/macrophages and with attenuation of NF-κB activation in the ipsilateral hemisphere following HI.

AB  - AIM: Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for improving affected upper limb function in children with hemiplegic cerebral palsy (CP). However, little is known about the changes in the brain that are induced by CIMT. This study was designed to investigate these changes and behavioural performance after CIMT intervention in mice with neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. METHOD: We utilized the neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury model established in mice pups. Three weeks after the injury, the mice were randomly assigned to the following three groups: the control group (n = 15), the enriched-environment group (n = 17), and the CIMT with an enriched-environment group (CIMT-EE, n = 15). 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine (BrdU) was injected daily to label proliferating cells during the 2 weeks of intervention. RESULTS: The CIMT-EE group showed better fall rate in the horizontal ladder rung walking test (mean 5.4%, SD 3.6%) than either the control (mean 14.3%, SD 7.3%; p = 0.001) or enriched-environment (mean 12.4%, SD 7.7%; p = 0.010) groups 2 weeks after the end of intervention. The CIMT-EE group also showed more neurogenesis (mean 7069 cells/mm³, SD 4017 cells/mm³) than either the control group (mean 1555 cells/mm³, SD 1422 cells/mm³; p < 0.001) or enriched-environment group (mean 2994 cells/mm³, SD 3498 cells/mm³; p = 0.001) in the subventricular zone. In the striatum, neurogenesis in the CIMT-EE group (mean 534 cells/mm³, SD 441 cells/mm³) was greater than in the control group (mean 95 cells/mm³, SD 133 cells/mm³; p = 0.001). INTERPRETATION: There was CIMT-EE enhanced neurogenesis in the brain along with functional benefits in mice after early hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of CIMT on neurogenesis and functional recovery after experimental injury to an immature brain.

AB  - One of a family of devastating lysosomal storage disorders, Krabbe disease is characterized by demyelination, psychosine accumulation, and inflammation. Affected infants rarely survive longer than 2 years. Using the twitcher mouse model of the disease, this study evaluated the potential of intrastriatal injection of adipose or bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) as a treatment option. Neonatal pups were injected with MSCs at 3-4 days of age and subjected to a battery of behavioral tests beginning at 15 days. While MSC injection failed to increase lifespan of twitchers, improvements in rotarod performance and twitching severity were observed at 27-38 days of age using MSCs derived from bone marrow. This study tested several different tasks developed in adult mice for evaluation of disease progression in immature twitchers. Rotarod was both reliable and extremely sensitive. Automated gait analysis using the Treadscan program was also useful for early evaluation of differences prior to overt gait dysfunction. Finally, this study represents the first use of the Stone T-maze in immature mice. Validation of rotarod and automated gait analysis for detection of subtle differences in disease progression is important for early stage efforts to develop treatments for juvenile disorders.

AB  - Low-level laser light therapy (LLLT) exerts beneficial effects on motor and histopathological outcomes after experimental traumatic brain injury (TBI), and coherent near-infrared light has been reported to improve cognitive function in patients with chronic TBI. However, the effects of LLLT on cognitive recovery in experimental TBI are unknown. We hypothesized that LLLT administered after controlled cortical impact (CCI) would improve post-injury Morris water maze (MWM) performance. Low-level laser light (800 nm) was applied directly to the contused parenchyma or transcranially in mice beginning 60-80 min after CCI. Injured mice treated with 60 J/cm² (500 mW/cm²×2 min) either transcranially or via an open craniotomy had modestly improved latency to the hidden platform (p<0.05 for group), and probe trial performance (p<0.01) compared to non-treated controls. The beneficial effects of LLLT in open craniotomy mice were associated with reduced microgliosis at 48 h (21.8±2.3 versus 39.2±4.2 IbA-1+ cells/200×field, p<0.05). Little or no effect of LLLT on post-injury cognitive function was observed using the other doses, a 4-h administration time point and 7-day administration of 60 J/cm². No effect of LLLT (60 J/cm² open craniotomy) was observed on post-injury motor function (days 1-7), brain edema (24 h), nitrosative stress (24 h), or lesion volume (14 days). Although further dose optimization and mechanism studies are needed, the data suggest that LLLT might be a therapeutic option to improve cognitive recovery and limit inflammation after TBI.

AB  - Hypoxic-ischemic (HI) brain injury occurring during the perinatal period is still a major cause of mortality and morbidity. We assessed the impact of maternal hypertension, the most common medical disorder of pregnancy, on the anatomical and functional consequences of HI insult in the immature brain. Rat pups from spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) and normotensive (Wistar Kyoto - WKY) dams were subjected to HI brain damage at post-natal day 7 (P7). Brain lesion and functional deficits were analyzed from 10 min to 35 days after HI, using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), sensorimotor and cognitive tests. MRI data revealed that SHR pups displayed less brain damage than WKY, attested by an initial smaller lesion followed by a reduced tissue loss at chronic stage (57.1±21.6 and 31.1±27% ipsilateral hemisphere atrophy in WKY and SHR, respectively). Behavioral analyses showed less HI-induced behavioral deficits in motor coordination (rotarod test) and spatial learning (Morris water maze test) in pups from hypertensive dams compared to those from normotensive ones. The data suggest that maternal hypertension causes prenatal stress that may render the immature brain more resistant to subsequent hypoxia-ischemia, related to a preconditioning phenomenon.

AB  - Studies have demonstrated that embryonic cell therapy is a potential approach for the treatment of Huntington's disease (HD). However, because of the limited resource of embryos, greater attention is needed in developing more efficient surgical techniques that not only enhance the therapy outcome but also avoid inefficient therapeutics of transplantation. In this study, we explored the curative effects of two different transplantation methods using a rat model of HD. Whole ganglionic eminence (WGE) cells or phosphate-buffered saline were transplanted into unilateral striatum of quinolinic acid (QA)-lesioned rats using microtransplantation instruments (with an outer diameter of 50 μm) or traditional transplantation instruments (with an outer diameter of 470 μm). Apomorphine-induced rotation test and adjusting step test were assessed after QA-induced lesion and 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks after transplantation. The expression of neuronal nuclei (NeuN), dopamine, cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein of molecular weight 32 kDa (DARPP-32), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was analyzed at 12 weeks after transplantation. We observed that microtransplanted rats performed better in the stepping test and had higher numbers of DARPP-32-positive cells compared with traditionally transplanted rats. Moreover, microtransplantation group showed lower GFAP expression surrounding the grafts in unilateral striatum and a higher survival rate posttransplantation compared with the traditional transplantation group. We conclude that microtransplantation is capable of enhancing therapeutic efficacy in the rat model of HD. This finding establishes the basis of an alternative transplantation strategy for treatment of HD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Acupuncture may effectively treat certain symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several studies have used functional brain imaging to investigate the mechanisms of acupuncture treatment on AD, these mechanisms are still poorly understood. We therefore further explored the mechanism by which needling at ST36 may have a therapeutic effect in a rat AD model. METHODS: A total of 80 healthy Wistar rats were divided into healthy control (n = 15) and pre-model (n = 65) groups. After inducing AD-like disease, a total of 45 AD model rats were randomly divided into three groups: the model group (n = 15), the sham-point group (n = 15), and the ST36 group (n = 15). The above three groups underwent PET scanning. PET images were processed with SPM2. RESULTS: The brain areas that were activated in the sham-point group relative to the model group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system, the right frontal lobe, and the striatum, whereas the activated areas in the ST36 group were primarily centred on the bilateral limbic system (pyriform cortex), the bilateral temporal lobe (olfactory cortex), the right amygdala and the right hippocampus. Compared with the sham-point group, the ST36 group showed greater activation in the bilateral amygdalae and the left temporal lobe. CONCLUSION: We concluded that needling at a sham point or ST36 can increase blood perfusion and glycol metabolism in certain brain areas, and thus may have a positive influence on the cognition of AD patients.

AB  - Stem cells have gained significant interest as a potential treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD). One source of these cells is adult neural stem cells (aNSCs), which differentiate easily into neuronal lineages. However, these cells are vulnerable to immune responses following transplantation. Another source is bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which release neurotrophic factors and anti-inflammatory cytokines following transplantation, and are less vulnerable to rejection. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy of transplants of MSCs, aNSCs, or cotransplants of MSCs and aNSCs for reducing deficits in a transgenic rat model of HD. HD rats received intrastriatal transplantations of 400,000 MSCs, aNSCs, or a combination of MSCs/aNSCs, while wild-type and HD controls were given vehicle. Rats were tested on the rotarod over the course of 20 weeks. The results indicated that transplants of: (a) aNSCs produced a strong immune response and conferred short-term behavioral benefits; (b) MSCs elicited a relatively weak immune response, and provided a longer term behavioral benefit; and (c) combined MSCs and aNSCs conferred long-term behavioral benefits and increased survival of the transplanted aNSCs. The finding that cotransplanting MSCs with aNSCs can prolong aNSC survival and provide greater behavioral sparing than when the transplants contains only aNSCs suggests that MSCs are capable of creating a more suitable microenvironment for aNSC survival. This cotransplantation strategy may be useful as a future therapeutic option for treating HD, especially if long-term survival of differentiated cells proves to be critically important for preserving lasting functional outcomes.

AB  - Although deep brain electrical stimulation can alleviate the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), just a small fraction of patients with PD can take advantage of this procedure due to its invasive nature. A significantly less invasive method--epidural spinal cord stimulation (SCS)--has been suggested as an alternative approach for symptomatic treatment of PD. However, the mechanisms underlying motor improvements through SCS are unknown. Here, we show that SCS reproducibly alleviates motor deficits in a primate model of PD. Simultaneous neuronal recordings from multiple structures of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic loop in parkinsonian monkeys revealed abnormal highly synchronized neuronal activity within each of these structures and excessive functional coupling among them. SCS disrupted this pathological circuit behavior in a manner that mimics the effects caused by pharmacological dopamine replacement therapy or deep brain stimulation. These results suggest that SCS should be considered as an additional treatment option for patients with PD.

AB  - Neonatal stroke occurs in approximately 1/4000 live births and results in life-long neurological impairments: e.g., cerebral palsy. Currently, there is no evidence-based specific treatment for neonates with stroke. Several studies have reported the benefits of umbilical cord blood (UCB) cell treatment in rodent models of neonatal brain injury. However, all of the studies examined the effects of administering either the UCB mononuclear cell fraction or UCB-derived mesenchymal stem cells in neonatal rat models. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of human UCB CD34(+) cells (hematopoietic stem cell/endothelial progenitor cells) in a mouse model of neonatal stroke, which we recently developed. On postnatal day 12, immunocompromized (SCID) mice underwent permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCAO). Forty-eight hours after MCAO, human UCB CD34(+) cells (1×10(5)cells) were injected intravenously into the mice. The area in which cerebral blood flow (CBF) was maintained was temporarily larger in the cell-treated group than in the phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)-treated group at 24h after treatment. With cell treatment, the percent loss of ipsilateral hemispheric volume was significantly ameliorated (21.5±1.9%) compared with the PBS group (25.6±5.1%) when assessed at 7weeks after MCAO. The cell-treated group did not exhibit significant differences from the PBS group in either rotarod (238±46s in the sham-surgery group, 175±49s in the PBS group, 203±54s in the cell-treated group) or open-field tests. The intravenous administration of human UCB CD34(+) cells modestly reduced histological ischemic brain damage after neonatal stroke in mice, with a transient augmentation of CBF in the peri-infarct area.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: To investigate if cranial X-irradiation reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques and influences cognitive function in a transgenic mouse model of AD. METHODS AND MATERIALS: B6.Cg-Tg (APPswePSEN1dE9)85Dbo/J AD-prone mice were given cranial X-irradiation. The number of Aβ plaques, along with expression of AD specific genes (84 genes: Mouse Alzheimer's Disease RT(2) Profiler), radiation-associated cytokines (Milliplex MAP Mouse Cytokine Chemokine Immunoassay) and immunohistochemistry (IL10, IL-1β, Iba1 CD45) was assessed. Behavioral testing was performed to relate changes in Aβ burden to cognitive function using a Morris water-maze task. RESULTS: Single X-ray doses reduced the number (p=0.002) and size (p=0.01) of Aβ plaques. Low-dose fractionation produced greater 50.6% (1 Gy × 10), 72% (2 Gy × 5) and 78% (2 Gy × 10) reductions. Irradiation was associated with gene (Pkp4, 1.5-fold, p=0.004) and proteomic (MIP-2, 8-fold, p=0.0024) changes at 24-48 h. Microglia increased at 4 weeks post-irradiation (p=0.001). The reduction in Aβ burden (2 Gy × 5) was associated with cognitive improvement (p=0.012). CONCLUSION: This is the first report that a clinically relevant course of external beam irradiation (2 Gy × 5) produces a significant reduction in AD-associated amyloid-β plaques with a subsequent improvement in cognitive function. However, longer-term studies are needed to define the precise underlying mechanism and longevity of this response.

AB  - We have reported previously that intracranial application of near-infrared light (NIr) - when delivered at the lower doses of 25J and 35J - reduces clinical signs and offers neuroprotection in a subacute MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) monkey model of Parkinson's disease. In this study, we explored whether a higher NIr dose (125J) generated beneficial effects in the same MPTP monkey model (n=15). We implanted an NIr (670nm) optical fibre device within a midline region of the midbrain in macaque monkeys, close to the substantia nigra of both sides. MPTP injections (1.8-2.1mg/kg) were made over a five day period, during which time the NIr device was turned on and left on continuously throughout the ensuing three week survival period. Monkeys were evaluated clinically and their brains processed for immunohistochemistry and stereology. Our results showed that the higher NIr dose did not have any toxic impact on cells at the midbrain implant site. Further, this NIr dose resulted in a higher number of nigral tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactive cells when compared to the MPTP group. However, the higher NIr dose monkeys showed little evidence for an increase in mean clinical score, number of nigral Nissl-stained cells and density of striatal tyrosine hydroxylase terminations. In summary, the higher NIr dose of 125J was not as beneficial to MPTP-treated monkeys as compared to the lower doses of 25J and 35J, boding well for strategies of NIr dose delivery and device energy consumption in a future clinical trial.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the effects of 3-h hypothermia on learning ability and motor function after growth, employing neonatal rat models with hyperthermic hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE). METHODS: We divided all rats into three groups: N (adult rats after neonatal hyperthermic HIE without subsequent 3-h hypothermia), H (adult rats after neonatal hyperthermic HIE with subsequent 3-h hypothermia) and Sham (S) groups. We evaluated their malfunctions with the rota-rod test and the step-down passive avoidance test. We also analyzed the cerebrum width and the hippocampal CA1 area of the insulted hemisphere. RESULTS: In the rota-rod test, the result of the N group was significantly worse than that of the S group. In the step-down passive avoidance test, the result of the N group was significantly worse than those of the S and H groups. The longest cerebrum width and the hippocampal CA1 area of the insulted hemisphere of the N group were significantly smaller than those of the S and H groups. CONCLUSION: Neonatal hyperthermic hypoxic-ischemic insult restricts motor function and learning ability after growth, and such neuronal malfunctions can be relieved by hypothermia for 3 h soon after neonatal HIE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cortical stimulation (CS) combined with rehabilitative training (RT) has proven effective for enhancing poststroke functional recovery in rats, but human clinical trials have had mixed outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy of CS/RT versus RT in a nonhuman primate model of cortical ischemic stroke. METHODS: Squirrel monkeys learned a pellet retrieval task, then received an infarct to the distal forelimb (DFL) representation of primary motor cortex. A subdural monopolar electrode was implanted over the spared DFL representation in dorsal premotor cortex (PMD). Seven weeks postinfarct, monkeys underwent 4 to 6 weeks of RT (n = 8) or CS/RT (n = 7; 100 Hz, cathodal current) therapy. Behavioral performance was assessed before and after infarct, prior to therapy, and 1 and 12 weeks posttherapy (follow-up). The primary outcome measure was motor performance at 1 week posttherapy. Secondary outcomes included follow-up performance at 12 weeks and treatment-related changes in neurophysiological maps of spared DFL representations. RESULTS: While postinfarct performance deficits were found in all monkeys, both groups demonstrated similar recovery profiles, with no difference in motor recovery between the RT and CS/RT groups. Posttherapy, PMD DFL area was significantly expanded in the RT group but not the CS/RT group. A significant relationship was found between motor recovery and DFL expansion in premotor cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the specific parameters utilized here were not optimal for promoting behavioral recovery in nonhuman primates. Though CS/RT has consistently shown efficacy in rat stroke models, the present finding has cautionary implications for translation of CS/RT therapy to clinical populations.

AB  - Most studies targeting chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) have concluded that neural stem/progenitor cell (NS/PC) transplantation exerts only a subclinical recovery; this in contrast to its remarkable effect on acute and subacute SCI. To determine whether the addition of rehabilitative intervention enhances the effect of NS/PC transplantation for chronic SCI, we used thoracic SCI mouse models to compare manifestations secondary to both transplantation and treadmill training, and the two therapies combined, with a control group. Significant locomotor recovery in comparison with the control group was only achieved in the combined therapy group. Further investigation revealed that NS/PC transplantation improved spinal conductivity and central pattern generator activity, and that treadmill training promoted the appropriate inhibitory motor control. The combined therapy enhanced these independent effects of each single therapy, and facilitated neuronal differentiation of transplanted cells and maturation of central pattern generator activity synergistically. Our data suggest that rehabilitative treatment represents a therapeutic option for locomotor recovery after NS/PC transplantation, even in chronic SCI.

AB  - The impact of human adult ischemia-tolerant mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and factors (stem cell factors) on cerebral amyloid beta (Aβ) pathology was investigated in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). To this end, hMSCs were administered intravenously to APPPS1 transgenic mice that normally develop cerebral Aβ. Quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction biodistribution revealed that intravenously delivered hMSCs were readily detected in APPPS1 brains 1 hour following administration, and dropped to negligible levels after 1 week. Notably, intravenously injected hMSCs that migrated to the brain region were localized in the cerebrovasculature, but they also could be observed in the brain parenchyma particularly in the hippocampus, as revealed by immunohistochemistry. A single hMSC injection markedly reduced soluble cerebral Aβ levels in APPPS1 mice after 1 week, although increasing several Aβ-degrading enzymes and modulating a panel of cerebral cytokines, suggesting an amyloid-degrading and anti-inflammatory impact of hMSCs. Furthermore, 10 weeks of hMSC treatment significantly reduced cerebral Aβ plaques and neuroinflammation in APPPS1 mice, without increasing cerebral amyloid angiopathy or microhemorrhages. Notably, a repeated intranasal delivery of soluble factors secreted by hMSCs in culture, in the absence of intravenous hMSC injection, was also sufficient to diminish cerebral amyloidosis in the mice. In conclusion, this preclinical study strongly underlines that cerebral amyloidosis is amenable to therapeutic intervention based on peripheral applications of hMSC or hMSC factors, paving the way for a novel therapy for Aβ amyloidosis and associated pathologies observed in AD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite clinical reports of poor outcomes, the degree to which resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta (REBOA) exacerbates traumatic brain injury (TBI) is not known. We hypothesized that combined effects of increased proximal mean arterial pressure (pMAP), carotid blood flow (Qcarotid), and intracranial pressure (ICP) from REBOA would lead to TBI progression compared with partial aortic occlusion (PAO) or no intervention. METHODS: Twenty-one swine underwent a standardized TBI via computer Controlled cortical impact followed by 25% total blood volume rapid hemorrhage. After 30 minutes of hypotension, animals were randomized to 60 minutes of continued hypotension (Control), REBOA, or PAO. REBOA and PAO animals were then weaned from occlusion. All animals were resuscitated with shed blood via a rapid blood infuser. Physiologic parameters were recorded continuously and brain computed tomography obtained at specified intervals. RESULTS: There were no differences in baseline physiology or during the initial 30 minutes of hypotension. During the 60-minute intervention period, REBOA resulted in higher maximal pMAP (REBOA, 105.3 ± 8.8; PAO, 92.7 ± 9.2; Control, 48.9 ± 7.7; p = 0.02) and higher Qcarotid (REBOA, 673.1 ± 57.9; PAO, 464.2 ± 53.0; Control, 170.3 ± 29.4; p < 0.01). Increases in ICP were greatest during blood resuscitation, with Control animals demonstrating the largest peak ICP (Control, 12.8 ± 1.2; REBOA, 5.1 ± 0.6; PAO, 9.4 ± 1.1; p < 0.01). There were no differences in the percentage of animals with hemorrhage progression on CT (Control, 14.3%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.6-57.9; REBOA, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0; and PAO, 28.6%; 95% CI, 3.7-71.0). CONCLUSION: In an animal model of TBI and shock, REBOA increased Qcarotid and pMAP, but did not exacerbate TBI progression. PAO resulted in physiology closer to baseline with smaller increases in ICP and pMAP. Rapid blood resuscitation, not REBOA, resulted in the largest increase in ICP after intervention, which occurred in Control animals. Continued studies of the cerebral hemodynamics of aortic occlusion and blood transfusion are required to determine optimal resuscitation strategies for multi-injured patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hemorrhagic stroke accounts for approximately 15% of all stroke cases, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Limited human studies suggested that scalp acupuncture could facilitate functional recovery after cerebral hemorrhage. In the current study, we used an animal model of cerebral hemorrhage to examine the potential effects of scalp acupuncture. METHODS: Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats received autologous blood (50μL) into the right caudate nucleus on the right side under pentobarbital anesthesia, and then received scalp acupuncture (DU20 through GB7 on the lesion side) or sham acupuncture (1cm to the right side of the acupoints) (n=10 per group). A group of rats receiving autologous blood into the caudate nucleus but no other intervention, as well as a group of rats receiving anesthesia but no blood injection to the brain (n=10 per group) were included as additional controls. Composite neuroscore, corner turn test, forelimb placing test, wire hang task and beam walking were used to evaluate the behavior of rats. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining was used to observe the histopathological changes. Western blot was used to detect the content of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and nuclear factor-KappaB (NFκB) protein expression. RESULTS: Scalp acupuncture attenuated neurological deficits (p<0.01 or <0.05 vs. sham acupuncture using a variety of behavioral tests) at 1-7days after the treatment. The brain content of TNF-α and NFκB was decreased (p<0.01 for both). CONCLUSIONS: Scalp acupuncture could improve neurological deficits in a rat model of hemorrhagic stroke.

AB  - Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is to date one of the major critical conditions causing death and disability worldwide. Exogenous neural stem/precursor cells (NSCs/NPCs) hold great promise for improving neurological dysfunction, but their functional properties in vivo remain unknown. Human neural precursor cells (hNPCs) carrying one fluorescent reporter gene (DsRed) can be observed directly in vivo using two-photon laser-scanning microscope. Therefore, we evaluated the neural integration and potential therapeutic effect of hNPCs on mice with TBI. Behavioral tests were performed by rotarod task and Morris Water Maze task. Neural integration was detected by fluorometric Ca2+ imaging and nerve tracing. We found that motor and cognition functions were significantly improved in mice with hNPCs injection compared to mice with vehicle treatment, and hNPCs integrated into the host circuit and differentiated toward neuronal lineage. Our study provided reliable evidence for further hNPCs transplantation in clinical practice.

AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that temporarily increasing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier using focused ultrasound can reduce β-amyloid plaque load and improve cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer's disease. However, the underlying mechanism and duration for which the effects of one treatment persists for are unknown. Here, we used in vivo two-photon fluorescence microscopy to track changes in β-amyloid plaque sizes in the TgCRND8 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease after one focused ultrasound treatment. We found that one treatment reduced plaques to 62 ± 16% (p ≤ 0.001) of their original volume two days post-sonication; this decrease in size persisted for two weeks. We then sought to evaluate the effectiveness of biweekly focused ultrasound treatments using magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound treatments. Three to five biweekly treatments resulted in a 27 ± 7% (p ≤ 0.01) decrease in plaque number and 40 ± 10% (p ≤ 0.01) decrease in plaque surface area compared to untreated littermates. This study demonstrates that one focused ultrasound treatment reduces the size of existing β-amyloid plaques for two weeks, and that repeated biweekly focused ultrasound treatments is an effective method of reducing β-amyloid pathology in moderate-to-late stages of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Neonatal hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) is major cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Therapeutic hypothermia is standard clinical care for moderate hypoxic-ischaemic (HI) brain injury, however it reduces the risk of death and disability only by 11% and 40% of the treated infants still develop disabilities. Thus it is necessary to develop supplementary therapies to complement therapeutic hypothermia in the treatment of neonatal HIE. The modified Rice-Vannucci model of HI in the neonatal mouse is well developed and widely applied with different periods of hypothermia used as neuroprotective strategy in combination with other agents. However, different studies use different periods, time of initiation and duration of hypothermia following HI, with subsequent varying degrees of neuroprotection. So far most rodent data is obtained using exposure to 5-6h of therapeutic hypothermia. Our aim was to compare the effect of exposure to three different short periods of hypothermia (1h, 1.5h and 2h) following HI insult in the postnatal day 7 C57/Bl6 mouse, and to determine the shortest period providing neuroprotection. Our data suggests that 1h and 1.5h of hypothermia delayed by 20min following a 60min exposure to 8%O2 do not prove neuroprotective. However, 2h of hypothermia significantly reduced tissue loss, TUNEL+ cell death and microglia and astroglia activation. We also observed improved functional outcome 7 days after HI. We suggest that the minimal period of cooling necessary to provide moderate short term neuroprotection and appropriate for the development and testing of combined treatment is 2h.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia and mainly treated by drugs, while the therapeutic outcomes are very limited. This study aimed to determine the optimized parameters of deep brain stimulation (DBS) which was applied to the treatment of AD and propose the involved mechanisms. METHODS: Amyloid-β precursor protein/Presenilin1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice were used and received DBS at nucleus basalis of Meynert (NBM). The optimized parameters of DBS were determined by using different stimulation frequencies, durations and ages of mice under Morris water maze test. The involved mechanisms and the possible signal pathways were also investigated. RESULTS: The optimized parameters for DBS were high frequency (100 Hz) for 21 days starting from early age (4 months old). Under the above parameters, the soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus and cortex were down-regulated significantly. DBS increased survival neurons and reduced apoptotic cells in the hippocampus and cortex. Meanwhile, the apoptosis-related proteins caspase-3, caspase-8 and Bid were down-regulated. Moreover, DBS caused a significant increase of superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase and choline acetyltransferase activity as well as a decrease of methane dicarboxylic aldehyde content and acetylcholine esterase activity. Phosphorylation of Akt (p-Akt)/total Akt (t-Akt) was up-regulated while p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)/t-ERK1/2 was down-regulated. The neuroprotective effect of DBS was attenuated by their inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: NBM-DBS starting from 4 months of age for 21 days at a high frequency (100 Hz) has therapeutic effects on AD through activating phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway and inhibiting ERK1/2 pathway.

AB  - Cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) is not only a cause of vascular dementia (VD) but also a contributing factor to Alzheimer's disease (AD). The essential pathological feature of CSVD is the disruption of blood-brain barrier (BBB). Dysfunction of BBB due to degeneration of both endothelial cells and pericytes in capillaries leads to neuronal damage and progressive brain atrophy. Moreover, deterioration of amyloid-β (Aβ) clearance due to the failure of the transvascular BBB transport system results in accumulation of Aβ in the brain. Intravenous infusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) elicits functional recovery in experimental models including stroke and spinal cord injury. One effect of MSCs is to restore disrupted BBB through remodeling of microvasculature. Using spontaneously hypertensive rats (stroke-prone) with impaired cognitive function as a CSVD model, we have shown that infused MSCs has a therapeutic effect for cognitive function. Restoration of BBB function via remodeling of microvasculature and inhibition of Aβ accumulation could inhibit progressive brain atrophy and lead to restore cognitive dysfunction. Gene expression analysis indicated that infused MSCs activates both transforming growth factor-β and angiopoietin 1 signaling pathways and promotes the remodeling of microvasculature. Thus, infused MSCs may represent a novel therapy for both VD and AD.

AB  - Background and Purpose- Inflammation is a critical determinant of aneurysmal wall destabilization, growth, and rupture risk. Targeting inflammation may suppress aneurysm rupture. Vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) has been shown to suppress inflammation both systemically and in the central nervous system. Therefore, we tested the effect of a novel noninvasive transcutaneous VNS approach on aneurysm rupture and outcome in a mouse model of intracranial aneurysm formation with wall inflammation. Methods- Aneurysms were induced by a single stereotaxic injection of elastase into the cerebrospinal fluid at the skull base, combined with systemic deoxycorticosterone-salt hypertension, without or with high-salt diet, for mild or severe outcomes, respectively. Cervical VNS (two 2-minute stimulations 5 minutes apart) was delivered once a day starting from the day after elastase injection for the duration of follow-up. Transcutaneous stimulation of the femoral nerve (FNS) served as control. Multiple aneurysms developed in the circle of Willis and its major branches, resulting in spontaneous ruptures and subarachnoid hemorrhage, neurological deficits, and mortality. Results- In the milder model, VNS significantly reduced aneurysm rupture rate compared with FNS (29% versus 80%, respectively). Subarachnoid hemorrhage grades were also lower in the VNS group. In the more severe model, both VNS and FNS arms developed very high rupture rates (77% and 85%, respectively). However, VNS significantly improved the survival rate compared with FNS after rupture (median survival 13 versus 6 days, respectively), without diminishing the subarachnoid hemorrhage grades. Chronic daily VNS reduced MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9) expression compared with FNS, providing a potential mechanism of action. As an important control, chronic daily VNS did not alter systemic arterial blood pressure compared with FNS. Conclusions- VNS can reduce aneurysm rupture rates and improve the outcome from ruptured aneurysms.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a brain-based neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by behavioral abnormalities. Accumulating studies show that the gut microbiota plays a vital role in the pathogenesis of ASD, and gut microbiota transplantation (GMT) is a promising technique for the treatment of ASD. In clinical applications of GMT, it is challenging to obtain effective transplants because of the high costs of donor selection and heterogeneity of donors' gut microbiota, which can cause different clinical responses. In vitro batch culture is a fast, easy-to-operate, and repeatable method to culture gut microbiota. Thus, the present study investigates the feasibility of treating ASD with in vitro cultured gut microbiota as transplants. We cultured gut microbiota via the in vitro batch culture method and performed GMT in the maternal immune activation (MIA)-induced ASD mouse model with original donor microbiota and in vitro cultured microbiota. Open field, three-chamber social, marble burying, and self-grooming tests were used for behavioral improvement assessment. Serum levels of chemokines were detected. Microbial total DNA was extracted from mouse fecal samples, and 16S rDNA was sequenced using Illumina. Our results showed that GMT treatment with original and cultured donor gut microbiota significantly ameliorated anxiety-like and repetitive behaviors and improved serum levels of chemokines including GRO-α (CXCL1), MIP-1α (CCL3), MCP-3 (CCL7), RANTES (CCL5), and Eotaxin (CCL11) in ASD mice. Meanwhile, the gut microbial communities of the two groups that received GMT treatment were changed compared with the ASD mice groups. In the group treated with in vitro cultured donor gut microbiota, there was a significant decrease in the relative abundance of key differential taxa, including S24-7, Clostridiaceae, Prevotella_other, and Candidatus Arthromitus. The relative abundance of these taxa reached close to the level of healthy mice. Prevotella_other also decreased in the group treated with original donor gut microbiota, with a significant increase in Ruminococcaceae and Oscillospira. The present study demonstrated that GMT with in vitro cultured microbiota also improved behavioral abnormalities and chemokine disorders in an ASD mouse model compared with GMT with original donor gut microbiota. In addition, it significantly modified several key differential taxa in gut microbial composition.

AB  - Early reperfusion is increasingly prioritized in ischemic stroke care, but outcomes remain suboptimal. Therefore, there is an urgent need to find neuroprotective approaches that can be combined with reperfusion to maximize efficacy. Here, the neuroprotective mechanisms behind therapeutic hypothermia were evaluated in a monkey model of ischemic stroke. Focal ischemia was induced in adult rhesus monkeys by placing autologous clots in the middle cerebral artery. Monkeys were treated with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) alone or t-PA plus selective intra-arterial cooling (SI-AC). Serial MRI scans and functional deficit were evaluated after ischemia. Histopathology and immunohistochemistry analysis were performed after the final MRI scan. t-PA plus SI-AC treatment led to a higher rate of MRI tissue rescue, and significantly improved neurologic deficits and daily activity scores compared with t-PA alone. In peri-infarct areas, higher fractional anisotropy values and greater fiber numbers were observed in models receiving t-PA plus SI-AC. Histological findings indicated that myelin damage, spheroids, and spongiosis were significantly ameliorated in models receiving SI-AC treatment. White matter integrity was also improved by SI-AC based on immunochemical staining. Our study demonstrates that SI-AC can be effectively combined with t-PA to improve both structural and functional recovery in a monkey model of focal ischemia. These findings provide proof-of-concept that it may be feasible to add neuroprotective agents as adjunctive treatments to reperfusion therapy for stroke.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Companion animals are prone to spinal cord injuries commonly associated with severe locomotor and sensory complications, which can escalate to a state of irreversible paralysis. Stem cell therapies propose a hope for treating spinal cord injuries via differentiation into neurons and associated glial cells, halting the immune attacks, inhibiting apoptosis and necrosis, and secretion of neurotrophic factors that stimulate the regeneration process. AIM: The study aims to evaluate the use of autologous bone marrow derived stromal cells in platelet-rich plasma carrier for selected clinical cases having chronic spinal cord injuries in dogs and cats via a one-time combined intrathecal/intravenous injection. METHODS: Cells were injected in five dogs and three cats suffering from disc protrusion leading to spinal cord injury and in thosewho did not respond to conventional treatment during a clinical trial. RESULTS: Results indicated that the transplanted cells led to the restoration of the weight bearing locomotor function and spinal reflexes in a period less than 90 days with physical rehabilitation. The treatment showed minor changes in the magnetic resonance images of extruded discs. CONCLUSION: This study concluded that the combined intrathecal/intravenous injection of bone marrow stromal cells is a safe and promising procedure for treating chronic spinal cord injuries in companion animals.

AB  - Cellular transplant therapy is one of the most common therapeutic strategies used to mitigate symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's disease (HD). Briefly, the main goal of the present study was to investigate HD's motor deficits through the olfactory ecto-mesenchymals stem cells (OE-MSC) secretome. OE-MSCs were characterized immunophenotypically by the positive expression of CD73, CD90 and CD105. Also, three specific markers of OE-MSCs were obtained from the nasal cavity of human volunteers. The main features of OE-MSCs are their high proliferation, ease of harvesting and growth factor secretion. All animals were randomly assigned to three groups: control, 3-NP + vehicle treated and 3-NP + Cell groups. In both experimental groups, the subjects received intraperitoneal 3-NP (30 mg/kg) injections once a day for five consecutive days, followed by the bilateral intra-striatal implantation of OE-MSCs in the 3-NP + Cell group. Muscular function was assessed by electromyography and rotarod test, and the locomotor function was evaluated using the open field test. According to our findings, striatal transplants of OE-MSCs reduced microglial inflammatory factor, the tumor necrosis factor (TNFα) in the 3-NP + Cell group, with a significant reduction in RIP3, the markers of necroptosis in striatum. In addition to the remarkable recovery of the striatal volume after engraftment, the motor activities were enhanced in the 3-NP + cell group compared to the 3-NP + vehicle group. Taken together, our results demonstrated the in vivo advantages of OE-MSCs treatment in an HD rat model with numerous positive paracrine effects including behavioral and anatomical recovery.

AB  - Central poststroke pain (CPSP) develops after a stroke around the somatosensory pathway. CPSP is hypothesized to be caused by maladaptive reorganization between various brain regions. The treatment for CPSP has not been established; however, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex has a clinical effect. To verify the functional reorganization hypothesis for CPSP development and rTMS therapeutic mechanism, we longitudinally pursued the structural and functional changes of the brain by using two male CPSP model monkeys (Macaca fuscata) developed by unilateral hemorrhage in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Application of rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex relieved the induced pain of the model monkeys. A tractography analysis revealed a decrease in the structural connectivity in the ipsilesional thalamocortical tract, and rTMS had no effect on the structural connectivity. A region of interest analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed inappropriately strengthened functional connectivity between the ipsilesional mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala, which are regions associated with emotion and memory, suggesting that this may be the cause of CPSP development. Moreover, rTMS normalizes this strengthened connectivity, which may be a possible therapeutic mechanism of rTMS for CPSP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Memory loss and cognitive impairment characterize the neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β (Aβ) is the key factor that triggers the course of AD, and reducing the deposition of Aβ in the brain has been considered as a potential target for the treatment of AD. In clinical and animal studies, electroacupuncture (EA) has been shown to be an effective treatment for AD. In recent years, substantial evidence has accumulated suggesting the important role of the glymphatic system in Aβ clearance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore whether EA modifies the accumulation of Aβ through the glymphatic system and may thus be applied to alleviate cognitive impairments. METHODS: Seven-month-old SAMP8 mice were randomized into a control group (Pc) and an electroacupuncture group (Pe). Age-matched SAMR1 mice were used as normal controls (Rc). Mice in the Pe group were stimulated on Baihui (GV20) and Yintang (GV29) for 10 min and then pricked at Shuigou (GV26) for ten times. EA treatment lasted for 8 weeks. In each week, EA would be applied once a day for the first five consecutive days and ceased at the remaining two days. After EA treatment, Morris water maze (MWM) test was used to evaluate the cognitive function; HE and Nissl staining was performed to observe the brain histomorphology; ELISA, contrast-enhanced MRI, and immunofluorescence were applied to explore the mechanisms underlying EA effects from Aβ accumulation, glymphatic system function, reactivity of astrocytes, and AQP4 polarization, respectively. RESULTS: This EA regime could improve cognition and alleviate neuropathological damage to brain tissue. And EA treatment might reduce Aβ accumulation, enhance paravascular influx in the glymphatic system, inhibit the reactivity of astrocytes, and improve AQP4 polarity. CONCLUSION: EA treatment might reduce Aβ accumulation from the brain via improving clearance performance of the glymphatic system and thereby alleviating cognitive impairment.

AB  - Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) targeting the primary motor cortex (MI) is expected to provide a therapeutic impact on spinal cord injury (SCI). On the other hand, treatment with antibody against repulsive guidance molecule-a (RGMa) has been shown to ameliorate motor deficits after SCI in rodents and primates. Facilitating activity of the corticospinal tract (CST) by rTMS following rewiring of CST fibers by anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert an enhanced effect on motor recovery in a primate model of SCI. To address this issue, we examined whether such a combined therapeutic strategy could contribute to accelerating functional restoration from SCI. In our SCI model, unilateral lesions were made between the C6 and the C7 level. Two macaque monkeys were used for each of the combined therapy and antibody treatment alone, while one monkey was for rTMS alone. The antibody treatment was continuously carried out for four weeks immediately after SCI, and rTMS trials applying a thermoplastic mask and a laser distance meter lasted ten weeks. Behavioral assessment was performed over 14 weeks after SCI to investigate the extent to which motor functions were restored with the antibody treatment and/or rTMS. While rTMS without the preceding antibody treatment produced no discernible sign for functional recovery, a combination of the antibody and rTMS exhibited a greater effect, especially at an early stage of rTMS trials, on restoration of dexterous hand movements. The present results indicate that rTMS combined with anti-RGMa antibody treatment may exert a synergistic effect on motor recovery from SCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs) transplantation on the changes of oligodendrocyte lineage in brain of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) rats. METHODS: The animals were divided into normal control group, EAE model group (EAE group), cell culture medium injection treatment group (placebo treatment group), and MSCs treatment group (treatment group). The changes of A2B5-, O4-, and CNPase-positive cells in oligodendrocyte lineage in rat brain were observed after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. RESULTS: The number of A2B5-positive cells in rat brain of the treatment group at each time point was significantly more than that of the EAE and placebo treatment groups, and most obvious at 14 days. The O4-positive cells number at each time point in the treatment group was significantly increased compared with the EAE and placebo treatment groups, and most obvious at 14 days. The CNPase-positive cells number at each time point in the treatment group was significantly increased compared with the EAE and placebo treatment groups, and most obvious at 14 days. CONCLUSIONS: MSCs treatment can increase cells expression in oligodendrocyte lineage, which laying a solid foundation for myelin regeneration.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder that causes dementia and affects millions of people worldwide. Although it has devastating outcomes for patients and tremendous economic costs to society, there is currently no effective treatment available. AIMS: The high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet (KD) is an established treatment for refractory epilepsy with a proven efficacy. Although the considerable interest has emerged in recent years for applying KD in AD patients, only few interventional studies in animals and humans have addressed the effects of KD on cognitive impairments, and the results were inconclusive. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of KD on cognitive functions and AD pathology in 5XFAD mice-a validated animal model of AD. RESULTS: Four months of a ketogenic diet improved spatial learning, spatial memory and working memory in 5XFAD mice. The improvement in cognitive functions was associated with a restored number of neurons and synapses in both the hippocampus and the cortex. Ketogenic diet treatment also reduced amyloid plaque deposition and microglial activation, resulting in reduced neuroinflammation. The positive effect of ketogenic diet on cognitive functions depended on the starting time and the duration of the diet. A shorter period (2 months) of ketogenic diet treatment had a weaker effect. Ketogenic diet initiated at late stage of AD (9 months of age) displayed no effect on cognitive improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate positive effects of ketogenic diet on both cognitive function and histopathology in Alzheimer's disease, which could be due to reduced microglial activation and neuroinflammation. Our findings provide new insights and therapeutic interventions for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. Despite enormous efforts around the world, there remains no effective cure for AD. This study was performed to investigate the effects of long-term exercise pretreatment on the typical pathology of AD in a novel transgenic AD rat model. Male 2-month-old animals were divided into the following groups: wild-type (WT) rats, AD rats, and AD rats with treadmill exercise pretreatment (AD-Exe). After exercise pretreatment, the Barnes maze task, passive avoidance task, and cued fear conditioning test were performed to test learning and memory function. The elevated plus maze, open field test, sucrose preference test, and forced swim test were conducted to measure anxious-depressive-like behavior. Immunofluorescence staining, Golgi staining, transmission electron microscopy, Western blot analysis, F-Jade C staining, TUNEL staining, and related assay kits were conducted to measure Aβ plaques, tau hyperphosphorylation, neuronal damage, neuronal degeneration, dendritic spine density, synapses, synaptic vesicles, mitochondrial morphology, mitochondrial dynamic, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. Behavioral tests revealed that long-term exercise pretreatment significantly alleviated learning and memory dysfunction and anxious-depressive-like behaviors in AD animals. In addition, exercise pretreatment attenuated amyloid-β deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation and preserved spine density, synapses, and presynaptic vesicles. Exercise also inhibited neuronal damage, neuronal apoptosis, and neuronal degeneration. Additional studies revealed the imbalance of mitochondrial dynamics was significantly inhibited by exercise pretreatment accompanied by a remarkable suppression of oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Our findings suggest that long-term exercise pretreatment alleviated behavioral deficits and typical pathologies of the AD rat model, supporting long-term exercise pretreatment as a potential approach to delay the progression of AD.

AB  - Behavioral flexibility (or set-shifting), which is regulated by the prefrontal cortex (PFC), is often impaired in patients with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is characterized by poor inhibitory control and reinforcement learning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed as a means of noninvasive brain stimulation and a potential therapeutic tool for modulating behavioral flexibility. Animal studies can pave the way to know if tDCS application can potentially benefit rule- and goal-based activities in ADHD. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and inbred Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as an animal model of ADHD and controls, respectively, and their strategy set-shifting abilities, including initial discrimination, set-shifting, and reversal learning tasks under 0-s or 15-s reinforcer delivery delay conditions, were evaluated. The tDCS treatment had a limited effect on the performance of the SHRs and WKY rats in initial discrimination task under 0-s delay condition. Under the 15-s delay condition, the SHRs had longer lever-press reaction times and/or more trial omissions than the WKY rats did when completing set-shifting and reversal-learning tasks. Among the SHRs, tDCS treatment improved the rats' reaction times and/or reduced their trial omissions in the set-shifting and reversal-learning tasks. Although tDCS may improve delayed reinforcement learning set-shifting performance in SHRs, further studies are required to clarify the responsible mechanism.

AB  - AIMS: Cerebrovascular impairment contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it still lacks effective intervention in clinical practice. Here, we investigated the efficacy of electroacupuncture (EA) in cerebrovascular repair in 3xTg-AD mice and its mechanism. METHODS: 3xTg-AD mice were employed to evaluate the protective effect of EA at ST36 acupoint (EAST36). Behavioral tests were performed to assess neurological disorders. Laser speckle contrast imaging, immunostaining, and Western blot were applied to determine EAST36-boosted cerebrovascular repair. The mechanism was explored in 3xTg mice and endothelial cell cultures by melatonin signaling modulation. RESULTS: EAST36 at 20/100 Hz effectively alleviated the olfactory impairment and anxiety behavior and boosted cerebrovascular repair in AD mice. EAST36 attenuated cerebral microvascular degeneration in AD mice by modulating endothelial cell viability and injury. Consequently, the Aβ deposits and neural damage in AD mice were reversed after EAST36. Mechanistically, we revealed that EAST36 restored melatonin levels in AD mice. Melatonin supplement mimicked the EAST36 effect on cerebrovascular protection in AD mice and endothelial cell cultures. Importantly, blockage of melatonin signaling by antagonist blunted EAST36-induced cerebrovascular recovery and subsequent neurological improvement. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provided strong evidence to support EAST36 as a potential nonpharmacological therapy against cerebrovascular impairment in AD. Further study is necessary to better understand how EAST36 treatment drives melatonin signaling.

AB  - Physical exercise has been recommended as a non-pharmacologic treatment for delaying the onset or slowing the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The therapeutic potential of exercise training-induced changes in symbiotic gut microbiota against AD neuropathology is not well understood, yet. This study investigated the effects of a 20-week forced treadmill exercise program on the makeup of the gut microbiota, the integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and the development of AD-like cognitive deficits and neuropathology in triple transgenic AD mice. Our findings show that forced treadmill running causes symbiotic changes in the gut microbiota, such as increased Akkermansia muciniphila and decreased Bacteroides species, as well as increased BBB-related protein expression and reduced AD-like cognitive impairments and neuropathology progression. The current findings of this animal study suggest that the interaction between the gut microbiota and the brain, possibly via the BBB, is responsible for exercise training-induced cognitive benefits and alleviation of AD pathology.

AB  - The induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are able to differentiate into dopaminergic neurons and execute the therapeutic effects for Parkinson's disease (PD). Here, we established a animal model of PD in Lanyu pigs by injecting 5 mg/kg of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine hydrochloride (MPTP). Next, the porcine iPSC-like cells (piPSC-like cells) were differentiated into D18 neuronal progenitors (D18 NPs) that were transplanted into the striatum to evaluate their therapeutic effects of PD. We showed that after 8 weeks of cell transplantation, the behavior score was significantly ameliorated and fully recovered at the 14th week of cell transplantation. The number of dopaminergic neurons was also significantly improved at the end of the experiment although the number was still about 50% lower than that in the control group. Our findings suggest that piPSC-like cell-derived D18 NPs exhibit a potential for the treatment of PD in the Lanyu pig model.

AB  - No curative or fully effective treatments are currently available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Electrical stimulation of deep brain areas has been proposed as a novel neuromodulatory therapeutic approach. Previous research from our lab demonstrates that intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) targeting medial forebrain bundle (MFB) facilitates explicit and implicit learning and memory in rats with age or lesion-related memory impairment. At a molecular level, MFB-ICSS modulates the expression of plasticity and neuroprotection-related genes in memory-related brain areas. On this basis, we suggest that MFB could be a promising stimulation target for AD treatment. In this study, we aimed to assess the effects of MFB-ICSS on both explicit memory as well as the levels of neuropathological markers ptau and drebrin (DBN) in memory-related areas, in an AD rat model obtained by Aβ icv-injection. A total of 36 male rats were trained in the Morris water maze on days 26-30 after Aβ injection and tested on day 33. Results demonstrate that this Aβ model displayed spatial memory impairment in the retention test, accompanied by changes in the levels of DBN and ptau in lateral entorhinal cortex and hippocampus, resembling pathological alterations in early AD. Administration of MFB-ICSS treatment consisting of 5 post-training sessions to AD rats managed to reverse the memory deficits as well as the alteration in ptau and DBN levels. Thus, this paper reports both cognitive and molecular effects of a post-training reinforcing deep brain stimulation procedure in a sporadic AD model for the first time.

AB  - In Huntington disease (HD), the mutant huntingtin (mtHTT) protein is the principal cause of pathological changes that initiate primarily along the cortico-striatal axis. mtHTT is ubiquitously expressed and there is, accordingly, growing recognition that HD is a systemic disorder with functional interplay between the brain and the periphery. We have developed a monoclonal antibody, C6-17, targeting an exposed region of HTT near the aa586 Caspase 6 cleavage site. As recently published, mAB C6-17 can block cell-to-cell propagation of mtHTT in vitro. In order to reduce the burden of the mutant protein in vivo, we queried whether extracellular mtHTT could be therapeutically targeted in YAC128 HD mice. In a series of proof of concept experiments, we found that systemic mAB C6-17 treatment resulted in the distribution of the mAB C6-17 to peripheral and CNS tissues and led to the reduction of HTT protein levels. Compared to CTRL mAB or vehicle treated mice, the mAB C6-17 treated YAC128 animals showed improved body weight and motor behaviors, a delayed progression in motor deficits and reduced striatal EM48 immunoreactivity. These results provide the first proof of concept for the feasibility and therapeutic efficacy of an antibody-based anti-HTT passive immunization approach and suggest this modality as a potential new HD treatment strategy.

AB  - Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, primarily in individuals under 65 years of age, and is the second most common form of dementia worldwide. There is no cure for FTD and current treatments offer limited symptomatic relief. Regular physical activity exhibits cognitive and neuroprotective benefits in healthy individuals and in various neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, but few studies have examined its efficacy in FTD. Accordingly, we investigated the impact of voluntary exercise training (VET) on the metabolic and behavioral characteristics of the rTg4510 transgenic mouse model of familial FTD. We show that regardless of genotype, VET increased energy expenditure, decreased sleep duration, and improved long-term memory in rTg4510 mice and WT littermates. Moreover, VET appeared to improve hyperactivity, a common feature of FTD, in rTg4510 mice. Although further work is required, these findings provide important insights into the potential benefits of physical activity in FTD.

AB  - Studies suggest that ketogenic diets (KD) may improve memory in mouse models of aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study determined whether a continuous or intermittent KD (IKD) enhanced cognitive behavior in the TgF344-AD rat model of AD. At 6 months-old, TgF344-AD and wild-type (WT) littermates were placed on a control (CD), KD, or IKD (morning CD and afternoon KD) provided as two meals per day for 2 or 6 months. Cognitive and motor behavior and circulating β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), AD biomarkers and blood lipids were assessed. Animals on a KD diet had elevated circulating BHB, with IKD levels intermediate to CD and KD. TgF344-AD rats displayed impaired spatial learning memory in the Barnes maze at 8 and 12 months of age and impaired motor coordination at 12 months of age. Neither KD nor IKD improved performance compared to CD. At 12 months of age, TgF344-AD animals had elevated blood lipids. IKD reduced lipids to WT levels with KD further reducing cholesterol below WT levels. This study shows that at 8 or 12 months of age, KD or IKD intervention did not improve measures of cognitive or motor behavior in TgF344-AD rats; however, both IKD and KD positively impacted circulating lipids.

AB  - Although photobiomodulation (PBM) and gamma visual stimulatqion (GVS) have been overwhelmingly explored in the recent time as a possible light stimulation (LS) means of Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapy, their effects have not been assessed at once. In our research, the AD mouse model was stimulated using light with various parameters [continuous wave (PBM) or 40 Hz pulsed visible LED (GVS) or 40 Hz pulsed 808 nm LED (PBM and GVS treatment)]]. The brain slices collected from the LS treated AD model mice were evaluated using (i) fluorescence microscopy to image thioflavine-S labeled amy-loid-β (Aβ) plaques (the main hallmark of AD), or (ii) two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) imaging of unlabeled Aβ plaques, showing that the amount of Aβ plaques was reduced after LS treatment. The imaging results correlated well with the results of Morris water maze (MWM) test, which demonstrated that the spatial learning and memory abilities of LS treated mice were noticeably higher than those of untreated mice. The LS effect was also assessed by in vivo nonlinear optical imaging, revealing that the cerebral amyloid angiopathy decreased spe-cifically as a result of 40 Hz pulsed 808 nm irradiation, on the contrary, the angiopathy reversed after visible 40 Hz pulsed light treatment. The obtained results provide useful reference for further optimization of the LS (PBM or GVS) parameters to achieve efficient phototherapy of AD.
