AB  - Cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) is reported to be an effective treatment for anxiety, a major presenting symptom among chemically dependent patients. In this study, 40 inpatient alcohol and/or polydrug users were given CES or sham CES in a double blind design. An additional 20 patients served as normal hospital routine controls. Dependent measures of anxiety were the Profile of Mood States, the Institute for Personality and Ability Testing Anxiety Scale, and the State/Trait Anxiety Index. CES-treated patients showed significantly greater improvement on all anxiety measures than did either control group. There were no differences in response between older and younger patients, or between the primarily drug or alcohol abusers. No placebo effect was found on any of our measures. It is concluded tht CES is a clinically significant addition to the treatment regimen for this patient population.

AB  - Stimulation of centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei has been proposed as a treatment for seizures. We implanted programmable subcutaneous (s.c.) stimulators into CM bilaterally in 7 patients with intractable epilepsy to test feasibility and safety. Stimulation was on or off in 3-month blocks, with a 3-month washout period in a double-blind, cross-over protocol. Stimuli were delivered as 90-microseconds pulses at 65 pulses/s, 1 min of each 5 min for 2 h/day, with voltage set to half the sensory threshold. Stimulation was safe and well-tolerated, with a mean reduction of tonic-clonic seizure frequency of 30% with respect to baseline when stimulator was on versus a decrease of 8% when the stimulator was off. There was no improvement in total number of generalized seizures with stimulation, and treatment differences were not statistically significant. Stimulation at low intensity did not alter the EEG acutely, but high-intensity stimulation induced slow waves or 2-3 Hz spike-waves with ipsilateral frontal maximum. In an open-label follow-up segment with stimulator trains continuing for 24 h/day, 3 of 6 patients reported at least a 50% decrease in seizure frequency. There were no side effects. This pilot project demonstrated the feasibility of controlled study of thalamic stimulation in epilepsy, but further study will be needed to demonstrate efficacy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bright light therapy in seasonal affective disorder (SAD) has been studied extensively. However, little attention has been given to subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder (SSAD) or the use of bright light in the workplace. Many patients using bright light boxes complain of the inconvenience of use. Much of this inconvenience involves the often-recommended early timing of the bright light therapy. Patients, who already have difficulty awakening, often have difficulty using the bright light therapy soon after awakening before going to work. If bright light could be used effectively in the workplace, the treatment would be more convenient; the improved convenience would probably improve compliance. In this study, we studied the effectiveness of bright light therapy in subjects with SSAD in the workplace, comparing morning bright light with afternoon bright light. METHOD: Morning and afternoon bright light treatment (2500 lux) were compared in 30 subsyndromal seasonal affective disorder patients using the bright light therapy in the workplace. Hamilton Depression Ratings and subjective measures of mood, energy, alertness and productivity were assessed before and after 2 weeks of light therapy. RESULTS: Both morning and evening bright light significantly decreased the depression ratings and improved the subjective mood, energy, alertness and productivity scores. However, there were no significant differences between the two times of administration of the bright light treatment. Both bright light treatments were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: Bright light given in the workplace improves subjective ratings of mood, energy, alertness and productivity in SSAD subjects. Morning and afternoon bright lights resulted in similar levels of improvement.

AB  - Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) has been used as a therapeutic tool in various psychiatric populations, but there have been no published studies with elderly schizophrenic patients. The authors evaluated, in a blinded, controlled manner, the effects of AAT in a closed psychogeriatric ward over 12 months. Subjects were 10 elderly schizophrenic patients and 10 matched patients (mean age: 79.1+/-6.7 years). The outcome measure was the Scale for Social Adaptive Functioning Evaluation (SAFE). AAT was conducted in weekly 4-hour sessions. Treatment encouraged mobility, interpersonal contact, and communication and reinforced activities of daily living (ADLs), including personal hygiene and independent self-care, through the use of cats and dogs as "modeling companions." The SAFE scores at termination showed significant improvement compared with baseline scores and were significantly more positive for the AAT group on both Total SAFE score and on the Social Functions subscale. AAT proved a successful tool for enhancing socialization, ADLs, and general well-being.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the effects of bright light therapy among demented nursing home patients with sleep disturbances. DESIGN AND SETTING: 11 nursing home patients with actigraphically measured sleep efficiency below 85% took part in an open, non-randomised study where the subjects served as their own control. INTERVENTION: After two weeks of baseline measurements and two weeks of pretreatment measurements, patients received bright light exposure 2 h/day within the period 08:00-11:00 for two weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Sleep-wake patterns during the 24-h day were evaluated by nursing staff ratings and wrist-worn motor activity devices (actigraphs). Sleep improved substantially with bright light exposure. Waking time within nocturnal sleep was reduced by nearly two h, and sleep efficiency improved from 73% to 86%. Corresponding improvements were found in nursing staff ratings. Effects were consistent across subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The findings add further evidence of the effectiveness of morning bright light exposure in the treatment of disturbed sleep among demented nursing home patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study examined the extent to which adherence to occupational therapy recommendations would increase the quality of life of persons with Alzheimer's disease living in the community and decrease the burden felt by family members caring for them. METHOD: Using a pretest-posttest control group design, the Assessment of Instrumental Function (AIF) was administered to two groups of persons with Alzheimer's disease in their own homes (n= 40). Caregivers completed measures of their feelings of burden and the quality of life, including level of function of the persons with Alzheimer's disease. RESULTS: A significant (MANCOVA) main effect was obtained for caregiver burden and three components of quality of life, positive affect, activity frequency and self-care status, by the treatment group, F(4, 31) = 7.34, p < .001. CONCLUSIONS: Individualized occupational therapy intervention based on the person-environment fit model appears effective for both caregivers and clients. This is especially important in light of a recent directive for more favorable reimbursement for occupational therapy services for persons with dementia.

AB  - CONTEXT: Female sexual pain and dysfunction. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a new site-specific, manual soft-tissue therapy in increasing orgasm and reducing dyspareunia (painful intercourse) in women with histories indicating abdominopelvic adhesion formation. DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: A total of 29 new patients presenting with infertility or abdominopelvic pain-related problems, and also indicating sexual pain or dysfunction, received a series of treatments (mean, 19.5 hours) designed to address biomechanical dysfunction and restricted mobility due to adhesions affecting the reproductive organs and adjacent structures. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were post-test vs pretest scores on: (1) the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI) full scale, orgasm domain, and pain domain; and (2) 3 supplemental 10-point rating scales of sexual pain levels. Secondary outcome measures were post-test vs pretest scores in the other 4 FSFI domains (desire, arousal, lubrication, and satisfaction). The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used for all statistical analyses. RESULTS: For the 23 patients available for follow-up, the paired FSFI post-test vs pretest scores were significant (P < or = .003) on all measures. Of the 17 patients who completed the 3 sexual pain scales, the paired post-test vs pretest scores were significant (P < or = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Many cases of inhibited orgasm, dyspareunia, and other aspects of sexual dysfunction seem to be treatable by a distinctive, noninvasive manual therapy with no risks and few, if any, adverse effects. The therapy should be considered a new adjunct to existing gynecologic and medical treatments.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe an adapted version of dialectical behavior therapy for adolescents with bipolar disorder. METHOD: The dialectical behavior therapy intervention is delivered over 1 year and consists of two modalities: family skills training (conducted with individual family units) and individual therapy. The acute treatment period (6 months) includes 24 weekly sessions; sessions alternate between the two treatment modalities. Continuation treatment consists of 12 additional sessions tapering in frequency through 1 year. We conducted an open pilot trial of the treatment, designed as an adjunct to pharmacological management, to establish feasibility and acceptability of the treatment for this population. Participants included 10 patients (mean age 15.8 +/- 1.5 years, range 14-18) receiving treatment in an outpatient pediatric bipolar specialty clinic. Symptom severity and functioning were assessed quarterly by an independent evaluator. Consumer satisfaction was also assessed posttreatment. RESULTS: Feasibility and acceptability of the intervention were high, with 9 of 10 patients completing treatment, 90% of scheduled sessions attended, and high treatment satisfaction ratings. Patients exhibited significant improvement from pre- to posttreatment in suicidality, nonsuicidal self-injurious behavior, emotional dysregulation, and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Dialectical behavior therapy may offer promise as an approach to the psychosocial treatment of adolescent bipolar disorder.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine whether high-intensity ambient light in public areas of long-term care facilities will improve sleeping patterns and circadian rhythms of persons with dementia. DESIGN: A cluster-unit crossover intervention trial involving four conditions: morning bright light, evening bright light, all-day bright light, and minimum standard light. SETTING: The common areas of two geriatric units in a psychiatric hospital and a dementia-specific residential care facility. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-six older adults with dementia. INTERVENTION: Ambient bright light of approximately 2,500 lux, delivered through a low-glare lighting system installed in the dining and activity areas. Participant exposure averaged 2.5 to 3.0 hours for the morning and evening interventions and 8.4 hours for the all-day intervention. MEASUREMENTS: Nighttime sleep using wrist actigraphy and daytime activity using nonobtrusive daytime observations. RESULTS: Night-time sleep increased significantly in participants exposed to morning and all-day light, with the increase most prominent in participants with severe or very severe dementia (mean increase 16 minutes (P=.008) for morning, and 14 minutes (P=.01) for all-day). Morning light produced a mean phase advance of 29 minutes (P=.02) and evening light a mean phase delay of 15 minutes (P=.06). Effects on daytime sleepiness were inconsistent, and the number of sleep bouts, mesor, amplitude, intradaily variability, and interdaily stability were not significantly different, indicating that the overall strength of day and night activity rhythms did not change significantly under any treatment condition. CONCLUSION: Bright light appears to have a modest but measurable effect on sleep in this population, and ambient light may be preferable to stationary devices such as light boxes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preoperative embolization in accordance with multimodal therapies for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) is generally the first step in treatment and may result in complete obliteration. The Onyx liquid embolic system (Micro Therapeutics, Inc., Irvine, CA) may offer advantages for intranidal targeted embolization and microsurgical resection. We present our experience in the combined treatment of intracranial AVMs using Onyx embolization and neurosurgical resection. METHODS: We treated a total of 47 patients for compact intracranial AVMs that were located in the frontal or frontoparietal area (16 patients); temporal, temporoparietal, or temporo-occipital regions (12 patients); parietal or parieto-occipital areas (8 patients); occipital regions (8 patients); had basal ganglia involvement (2 patients); and was cerebellar (1 patient). The Spetzler-Martin grading scale values were as follows: 25 patients were Grades I or II, 10 patients were Grade III, and 12 patients were Grades IV or V. Twenty-three AVMs were located in eloquent brain regions. RESULTS: After we performed final embolizations, the mean nidus reduction was 84%. Seven patients had new, nondisabling neurological deficits, and four patients had new, disabling neurological deficits after embolization. Periprocedurally, five vessel perforations and four stuck microcatheters were encountered without clinical deficits. In two patients, delayed hemorrhage after embolization occurred with good clinical outcome. We completely resected 46 AVMs; in one patient, we detected an AVM on postoperative angiography. The mean operative time was 4.7 hours, and the mean blood loss was 455 mL. Clinical status worsened postoperatively in 14 patients. Angiographic and clinical follow-up examinations were available for 42 patients (89%); the average follow-up period was 13 months. We found no relapse of arteriovenous shunt. Fourteen patients improved clinically after discharge. Of the 42 patients followed up, 23 individuals had no neurological deficit, 16 had a nondisabling deficit, and three had a disabling deficit. CONCLUSION: Preoperative use of the Onyx liquid embolic system in cerebral AVM treatment allows profound occlusion by targeted embolization and provides a basis for safe neurosurgical resection.

AB  - The relations between cognition and autism severity, head size and intervention outcome, were examined. Change in cognitive level with intervention was measured in children with autism and compared to children with developmental disabilities (DD). Eighty-one children (mean age 25.9 months) with autism (n=44) and DD (n=37) were assessed at pre- and post 1 year of intervention. Cognitive abilities and autism severity were measured by standardized tests. Three pre-intervention cognitive level groups: normal (IQ>90), borderline (70<IQ<89) and impaired (50<IQ<69) were examined. The impaired group had more severe autism symptoms than the borderline and the normal cognitive groups. However, following intervention the groups did not differ in the change in core autism symptoms. IQ scores increased significantly more in the autism group than in the DD group. IQ improvements correlated significantly with reduction in autism symptoms and mostly in stereotyped behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Cognitive ability in autism is associated with autism severity. Two distinct subtypes based on cognitive level are identified. However, baseline cognitive level cannot predict the progress rate in autism symptoms with intervention. Improvement of social-communicative behaviors and the intensive intervention are related to significant cognitive increments in autism.

AB  - PURPOSE: To analyse the effects of two interventions on the cognition and balance of institutionalized elderly people with mixed dementia. METHODS: Fifty-four participants were allocated into three groups. Group 1 was assisted by an interdisciplinary programme comprising physiotherapy, occupational therapy and physical education. A physiotherapist alone carried out the intervention in group 2. Group 3 was considered as control. Assessors were blinded to guarantee the absence of bias. Cognitive functions were analysed with the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery. Balance was assessed with the Berg Balance Scale and the Timed Get-Up-and-Go Test. Multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) was used to test possible main effects of the interventions. RESULTS: The results showed benefits on the balance of subjects in both groups 1 (F=3.9, P<0.05) and 2 (F=3.1, P<0.05), compared with group 3. MANOVA did not indicate benefits on the cognitive functions between groups 1 and 3 (F=1.1, P>0.05) and groups 2 and 3 (F=1.6, P>0.05). However, univariate analysis indicated some benefits of the interdisciplinary intervention on two specific domains measured by the Brief Cognitive Screening Battery (F=26.5, P<0.05; F=4.4, P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Six months of multidisciplinary or physiotherapeutic intervention were able to improve a person's balance. Although global cognition did not improve through treatment, when the intervention was carried out on a multidisciplinary basis we observed an attenuation in the decline of global cognition on two specific cognitive domains. Exercises applied in different contexts may have positive outcomes for people with dementia.

AB  - This pilot study examines the efficacy of a group memory notebook intervention. Five individuals with very mild dementia and 4 spouses who served as coaches attended 14 group treatment sessions. Therapists use educational strategies and learning activities packets to teach memory notebook use. At posttreatment, coaches report fewer symptoms of depression, and participants with very mild dementia report greater confidence in ability to obtain support. Modified laboratory memory testing reveals that participants with dementia demonstrate improved posttreatment memory scores because of increased note-taking behavior and more frequent referencing of notes. Although more frequent everyday memory strategies use is reported at posttreatment, this does not translate into reports of fewer everyday memory failures or greater everyday independence for the participants with dementia. This study demonstrates that a multidyad group intervention can successfully be used to teach patients with very mild dementia to use a memory notebook, with beneficial effects for both members of the care dyad.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, the importance of non-pharmacological therapies for dementia has come to the fore. In the present study, we examined the curative effects of aromatherapy in dementia in 28 elderly people, 17 of whom had Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: After a control period of 28 days, aromatherapy was performed over the following 28 days, with a wash out period of another 28 days. Aromatherapy consisted of the use of rosemary and lemon essential oils in the morning, and lavender and orange in the evening. To determine the effects of aromatherapy, patients were evaluated using the Japanese version of the Gottfries, Brane, Steen scale (GBSS-J), Functional Assessment Staging of Alzheimer's disease (FAST), a revised version of Hasegawa's Dementia Scale (HDS-R), and the Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) four times: before the control period, after the control period, after aromatherapy, and after the washout period. RESULTS: All patients showed significant improvement in personal orientation related to cognitive function on both the GBSS-J and TDAS after therapy. In particular, patients with AD showed significant improvement in total TDAS scores. Result of routine laboratory tests showed no significant changes, suggesting that there were no side-effects associated with the use of aromatherapy. Results from Zarit's score showed no significant changes, suggesting that caregivers had no effect on the improved patient scores seen in the other tests. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we found aromatherapy an efficacious non-pharmacological therapy for dementia. Aromatherapy may have some potential for improving cognitive function, especially in AD patients.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of structured group reminiscence therapy on behavior competence and physical functioning and to compare effectiveness of the intervention by stage of dementia in Taiwanese elders residing in institutional settings. A longitudinal experimental design was used. Seventy-seven Taiwanese elderly participants completed the study; 38 in the intervention group and 39 in the control group. Participants in the intervention group received one reminiscence therapy session weekly for 8 weeks; those in the control group received regular nursing care. Barthel's index (BI) and the Clifton Assessment Procedures for the Elderly Behavior Rating Scale (CAPE-BRS) were administered pre- and post-intervention. Findings indicated that no significant differences between the intervention and control groups on overall behavioral competence (p=0.12) or physical functioning (p=0.44). However, slight overall improvement was identified, statistically significant for the social disturbance subscale of the CAPE-BRS was found (p=0.011). There were no significant changes in overall behavior competence (p=0.11) or physical functioning (p=0.30) by stage of dementia (mild vs. moderate) in the intervention group, counter to the hypothesis. Although our results did not demonstrate a significant effect of structured group reminiscence therapy on overall behavior competency or on physical functioning in elders with dementia, we identified issues related to future implementation of this intervention, such as study power, chosen outcome measures, intervention dose, timing of outcome measures, or cultural applicability issues.

AB  - Spiritual Self-Schema (3-S) is a weekly 8-session, mindfulness-based, manual-guided, individual intervention targeting addiction and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors that integrates cognitive behavioral strategies with Buddhist principles and clients' religious/spiritual beliefs. 3-S is efficacious for reducing drug use and HIV risk behaviors among mixed-gender, methadone-maintained outpatients. The study goal was to conduct a preliminary evaluation of 3-S therapy among urban, low-income Latinas (n = 13) in residential addiction treatment. Data gathered via in-person interviews (baseline, 8 and 20 weeks postentry) showed high rates of 3-S acceptability and positive changes in a number of outcomes relevant to recovery from addiction and to HIV prevention, including impulsivity, spirituality, motivation for change, and HIV prevention knowledge. The study findings are promising; however, a controlled study with longer follow-up is needed to rigorously assess the efficacy of 3-S therapy with Latinas in substance abuse treatment.

AB  - In spite of the existence of evidence-based treatments for hypochondriasis, or severe health anxiety, recovery rates are low and morbidity is high. Therefore, more treatment options are needed for this prevalent condition. Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) interventions have been gaining research and clinical attention for the treatment of mood, and more recently anxiety disorders. A small, uncontrolled pilot study of an 8-week group MBCT intervention for hypochondriasis was conducted. Ten subjects (five females and five males) with a mean age of 35.6 (range=25-59) recruited from an academic community health network met criteria and completed the study. There were significant improvements in measures of health anxiety, disease-related thoughts, somatic symptoms, and mindfulness at the end of treatment, and these benefits were sustained at 3-month follow-up. Participants evidenced high treatment satisfaction, with no drop-outs or adverse events. These findings provide the basis for a larger, more rigorous, controlled trial of this promising treatment approach.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anxiety has a high prevalence among individuals with dementia, and it has a significant negative impact on their functioning; yet intervention studies are lacking. We developed Peaceful Mind, a cognitive-behavioral intervention for persons with dementia. In this paper, we describe the intervention and results of an open trial evaluating the feasibility and utility of the intervention and assessment procedures. METHODS: Peaceful Mind is implemented over a period of three months in the participant's home with involvement of a caregiver or "collateral." Dyads are followed for an additional three months via telephone. An assortment of simplified skills is offered, including self-awareness, breathing, behavioral activation, calming thoughts, and sleep skills. RESULTS: Nine participants were enrolled, eight completed the three-month assessment, and seven completed the six-month assessment. Overall, participants and collaterals were satisfied with the intervention and reported that they benefited in terms of anxiety, depression, and collateral distress. CONCLUSIONS: A randomized controlled trial would help determine whether this promising new treatment has a statistically significant impact on anxiety in this population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To evaluate the effects of pet therapy on cognitive function, mood and perceived quality of life on elderly inpatients (mean age 84.7 years; 95.2% women) affected by dementia, depression and psychosis. METHODS: Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and 15-items Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) were administered to 10 patients (pet group) and 11 controls (control group) together with a self-perceived quality-of-life questionnaire, before and after a pet therapy intervention that lasted 6 weeks. MMSE and GDS mean scores were compared between and within groups by Student's t-test. RESULTS: Both the pet group and control group improved on GDS and MMSE. Within the pet group, GDS symptoms decreased by 50% (from 5.9 to 2.7, P= 0.013), whereas mean MMSE score increased by 4.5 (P= 0.060). The between group comparison showed a positive effect of pet therapy intervention on GDS (P= 0.070). Most of the participants reported an improvement of their perceived quality of life. CONCLUSIONS: Pet therapy is efficient in improving depressive symptoms and cognitive function in residents of long-term care facilities with mental illness.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preliminary studies suggest beneficial effects of animal-assisted activities (AAA) on behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), but data are inconsistent. This study aimed to assess the effect of AAA with dogs on cognition, BPSD, emotional status and motor activity in severe Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: Ten patients attending an Alzheimer Day Care Center (ADCC) participated in a repeated measures study, which included: two weeks' pre-intervention, three weeks' control activity with plush dogs (CA), and three weeks' AAA. Cognitive function (Severe Impairment Battery), mood (Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia; CSDD), BPSD (Neuropsychiatric Inventory; NPI) and agitation (Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory; CMAI) were assessed at baseline and after each period. Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) for emotional status, Agitated Behavior Mapping Instrument (ABMI) and a checklist for motor activity were completed across the study periods, both during intervention sessions and after three hours. RESULTS: Cognition and NPI were unchanged across the study. Declines in the CMAI and CSDD scores after AAA were not significant, while the NPI anxiety item score decreased in comparison with CA (CA 3.1±2.3, AAA 1.5±2.7, p = 0.04). OERS "sadness" decreased (p = 0.002), while "pleasure" (p = 0.016) and "general alertness" (p = 0.003) increased during AAA compared with CA sessions, and observed sadness remained lower after three hours (p = 0.002). Motor activity increased significantly during AAA. CONCLUSION: In this sample of severe AD patients in ADCC, AAA was associated with a decrease in anxiety and sadness and an increase in positive emotions and motor activity in comparison with a control activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effects of motor intervention on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and on the caregivers' burden. DESIGN: This is a controlled trial evaluating the effects of a motor intervention program on the neuropsychiatric symptoms. SETTING: The intervention was performed on community patients from two university centers specializing in physical exercise for the elderly. SUBJECTS: Patients with Alzheimer's disease were divided into two groups: sixteen received the motor intervention and sixteen controls (five controls were excluded because of clinical intercurrences). INTERVENTIONS: Aerobic exercises (flexibility, strength, and agility) and functional balance exercises were conducted over six months for 60 minutes three times per week. MAIN MEASURES: Psychopathological features of patients were evaluated with the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia. Caregivers were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Distress and Burden Interview. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to observe interactions (pre- vs. post-intervention; participants vs. controls). RESULTS: Patients from the intervention presented a significant reduction in neuropsychiatric conditions when compared to controls (Neuropsychiatric Inventory: F: 11.12; p = 0.01; Cornell Depression scale: F: 11.97; p = 0.01). The burden and stress of caregivers responsible for patients who participated in the intervention significantly decreased when compared to caregivers responsible for controls (Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Distress: F: 9.37; p = 0.01; Burden Interview: F: 11.28; p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was associated with a reduction in the neuropsychiatric symptoms and contributed to attenuate the caregivers' burden. However, the researchers were not blinded to the patient's intervention status, which constitutes an important limitation of this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the influence of a six-month exercise program on neuropsychiatric disorders and on the performance of instrumental activities in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHODS: The study included 20 patients with AD in the mild to moderate stages of the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) divided into two groups: the experimental group, composed of 10 women who participated in the six-month exercise program, and the control group, composed of the 10 remaining AD patients who did not take part in an exercise program during the same period. All participants were evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Exam for global cognitive function, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire for neuropsychiatric disorders, and the Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire for the degree of functional impairment. RESULTS: The control group showed functional and neuropsychiatric deterioration in the comparisons between pre- and post-intervention times and between groups. CONCLUSION: The experimental group showed a propensity for less deterioration in neuropsychiatric disorders and performance of instrumental activities compared to the sedentary group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A new communication method, the "Veder method", has recently been developed. Caregivers are trained to apply this method in a group activity ("living-room theatre activity") for people with dementia in which theatrical stimuli are used in combination with proven emotion-oriented care methods. The aim of this exploratory study was to evaluate the added value of the Veder method group activity compared to a regular reminiscence group activity and to investigate whether professional carers can achieve the same effects with the Veder method as professional actors. METHODS: A quasi-experimental three-group design was used. Experimental group 1 (E1; n = 65) joined a living-room theatre activity offered by trained professional caregivers. Experimental group 2 (E2; n = 31) joined a living-room theatre activity offered by professional actors. The control group (n = 55) received a usual reminiscence group activity. Behavior, mood and aspects of quality of life were measured using standardized observation scales at three points in time: (T1) pretest; (T2) during the intervention and; (T3) post-test, two hours after the intervention. RESULTS: During the intervention, significant differences were found in favor of the group that was offered a living-room theatre activity by actors (E2) on different aspects of behavior, mood and quality of life. At post-test, people in E2 were more alert compared to the control group. Moreover, they recalled more memories and showed less socially isolated behavior compared to the control group. CONCLUSION: This exploratory study shows that the Veder method has some clear positive effects on behavior and mood of people with dementia when applied by professional actors.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical therapy is recommended for the treatment of Huntington's disease, but reliable studies investigating its efficacy are almost non-existent. This may in part be due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Therefore, we investigated the applicability of novel quantitative and objective assessments of motor dysfunction in the evaluation of physical therapy interventions aimed at improving gait and posture. METHODS: Twelve patients with Huntington disease received a predefined twice-weekly intervention focusing on posture and gait over 6 weeks. The GAITRite mat and a force plate were used for objective and quantitative assessments. The Unified Huntingtons Disease Rating Scale Total Motor Score, the timed Up &Go test, and the Berg Balance Scale were used as clinical outcome measures. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen in GAITRite measures after therapy. Improvements were also seen in the Up & Go test and Berg Balance Scale, whereas force plate measures and Total Motor Scores did not change. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that physical therapy has a positive effect on gait in Huntington's disease. The study shows that objective and quantitative measures of gait and posture may serve as endpoints in trials assessing the efficacy of physical therapy. They should be explored further in larger trials applying a randomized controlled setting.

AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the extent of ocular, motor control problems and the effect of visual therapy on such problems, among seven- to eight-year-old children diagnosed with DCD. Thirty-two, children with a mean age of 95.66 months (SD ± 3.54) participated in the study. The MABC was used to classify children into DCD categories (<15th, percentile) while the Sensory Input Systems Screening Test and QNST-II, were used to evaluate ocular motor control. A two-group pre-test-post-test, cross-over design was followed with a retention test two years, thereafter to determine the lasting effect of the visual therapy, intervention. The 18-week visual therapy programme was executed once a week, for 40 min during school hours, after which the two groups were, crossed over. Percentages of ocular motor control problems ranging, between 6.25% and 93.75% were found in both the groups before participating, in the visual therapy programme, with the highest percentage problems found, in visual pursuit with the left eye. Visual therapy contributed to a, significant improvement of 75-100% in visual pursuit, fixation, ocular, alignment and convergence, with significant lasting effects (p<0.001). Visual therapy is recommended for children with DCD experiencing poor, ocular motor control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cannabis users frequently report concurrent tobacco use, and tobacco use is associated with poorer outcomes during treatment for cannabis use disorders (CUD). Interventions that simultaneously target both tobacco and cannabis use disorders may enhance cessation outcomes for either or both substances. METHODS: This study evaluated an intervention integrating highly effective treatments for cannabis and tobacco use disorders. Thirty-two participants meeting diagnostic criteria for CUD and reporting daily tobacco use were enrolled in a 12-week computer-assisted behavioral treatment for CUD. Participants were encouraged to participate in a tobacco intervention that included a computer-assisted behavioral treatment tailored for tobacco and cannabis co-users, and nicotine-replacement therapy (NRT). Cannabis and tobacco outcomes were evaluated using descriptive statistics and were compared to a historical control group that received treatment for CUD but not tobacco. RESULTS: Participants achieved 3.6±4.3 consecutive weeks of cannabis abstinence, which was comparable to the historical control group (3.1±4.4). A majority of the sample (78%) completed at least one tobacco module and 44% initiated NRT. Over half (56%) initiated tobacco quit attempts, and 28% were tobacco abstinent for at least two consecutive weeks. Participants showed greater reduction in tobacco use (cigarettes per day) than the historical control group, but differences in tobacco abstinence rates during the final month of treatment were not statistically significant (12.5% vs. 4%). CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that providing a tobacco intervention during treatment for CUD is feasible and may positively impact tobacco use without negatively affecting cannabis use outcomes.

AB  - The use of dolls as a therapeutic intervention for nursing home residents with dementia is relatively new. The current article describes a research study implemented with nursing home residents in Korea to examine the effects of doll therapy on their mood, behavior, and social interactions. A one-group, pretest-posttest design was used to measure the impact of doll therapy on 51 residents with dementia. Linear regression demonstrated statistically significant differences in aggression, obsessive behaviors, wandering, negative verbalization, negative mood, and negative physical appearance after introduction of the doll therapy intervention. Interactions with other individuals also increased over time. Findings support the benefits of doll therapy for nursing home residents with dementia; however, further research is needed to provide more empirical evidence and explore ethical considerations in the use of doll therapy in this vulnerable population.

AB  - AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of a music intervention on hospitalised psychiatric patients with different levels of anxiety. BACKGROUND: In clinical practice, psychiatric inpatients and nurses routinely suffer from anxiety. A music intervention may possibly be useful, but knowledge as to how useful and how effective it is in patients with different levels of anxiety is limited. DESIGN: The study design was a three-group, repeated-measures experimental study. METHODS: Subjects were 22 psychiatric patients who were divided into three groups based on their level of anxiety. They listened to 20 minutes of music each day for 10 days and were assessed using the Beck Anxiety Inventory before and after the music intervention and at a one-week follow-up; an electroencephalogram and finger temperature were monitored before and during the music intervention. RESULTS: Anxiety levels of all three groups showed a significant difference (p = 0·0339) after the intervention. The difference alpha and beta electroencephalogram percentages for all three groups showed a significant difference (p = 0·04; p = 0·01). The finger temperature showed a non-significant difference (p = 0·41). CONCLUSIONS: A music intervention can effectively alleviate the anxiety of hospitalised psychiatric patients who suffer from all levels of anxiety. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The study recommends a practice in alleviating anxiety. Effective lower-cost interventions to reduce anxiety in psychiatric inpatient settings would be of interest to nurses and benefit patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Theta-burst stimulation (TBS) modulates synaptic plasticity more efficiently than standard repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation delivery and may be a promising modality for neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD). At present there are few effective interventions for prefrontal cortex dysfunction in ASD. We report on an open-label, pilot study of intermittent TBS (iTBS) to target executive function deficits and restricted, repetitive behaviors in male children and adolescents with ASD. METHODS: Ten right-handed, male participants, aged 9-17 years with ASD were enrolled in an open-label trial of iTBS treatment. Fifteen sessions of neuronavigated iTBS at 100% motor threshold targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were delivered over 3 weeks. RESULTS: Parent report scores on the Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale demonstrated improvements with iTBS treatment. Participants demonstrated improvements in perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test and total time for the Stroop test. The iTBS treatments were well tolerated with no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results suggest that further controlled interventional studies of iTBS for ASD are warranted.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that specialized, multi-component treatment programmes produce improvements in numerous outcomes among individuals with first-episode psychosis. However, these programmes often lack interventions specifically designed to address deficits in social cognition. This raises questions about the effectiveness of such programmes in addressing deficits in social cognition that accompany psychotic disorders. We investigated the effect of participation in a multi-component treatment programme on social cognition among 71 individuals with first-episode psychosis. Participants experienced gains in emotion processing, social knowledge, social perception and theory of mind. However, after controlling for multiple comparisons, these improvements were limited to theory of mind and recognition of social cues in low emotion interactions. Although our findings should be interpreted cautiously, they raise the possibility that individuals participating in multi-component treatment programmes for first-episode psychosis without interventions specifically targeting social cognition may still experience gains in social cognition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a chronic and disabling disorder with poor response to pharmacological treatments. Converging evidences suggest that OCD patients suffer from dysfunction of the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuit, including in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). OBJECTIVE: To examine whether modulation of mPFC-ACC activity by deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (DTMS) affects OCD symptoms. METHODS: Treatment resistant OCD participants were treated with either high-frequency (HF; 20 Hz), low-frequency (LF; 1 Hz), or sham DTMS of the mPFC and ACC for five weeks, in a double-blinded manner. All treatments were administered following symptoms provocation, and EEG measurements during a Stroop task were acquired to examine changes in error-related activity. Clinical response to treatment was determined using the Yale-Brown-Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS). RESULTS: Interim analysis revealed that YBOCS scores were significantly improved following HF (n = 7), but not LF stimulation (n = 8), compared to sham (n = 8), and thus recruitment for the LF group was terminated. Following completion of the study, the response rate in the HF group (n = 18) was significantly higher than that of the sham group (n = 15) for at least one month following the end of the treatment. Notably, the clinical response in the HF group correlated with increased Error Related Negativity (ERN) in the Stroop task, an electrophysiological component that is attributed to ACC activity. CONCLUSION: HF DTMS over the mPFC-ACC alleviates OCD symptoms and may be used as a novel therapeutic intervention. Notwithstanding alternative explanations, this may stem from DTMS ability to directly modify ACC activity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small aggregates (oligomers) of the toxic proteins amyloid-β (Aβ) and phospho-tau (p-tau) are essential contributors to Alzheimer's disease (AD). In mouse models for AD or human AD brain extracts, Transcranial Electromagnetic Treatment (TEMT) disaggregates both Aβ and p-tau oligomers, and induces brain mitochondrial enhancement. These apparent "disease-modifying" actions of TEMT both prevent and reverse memory impairment in AD transgenic mice. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and initial clinical efficacy of TEMT against AD, a comprehensive open-label clinical trial was performed. METHODS: Eight mild/moderate AD patients were treated with TEMT in-home by their caregivers for 2 months utilizing a unique head device. TEMT was given for two 1-hour periods each day, with subjects primarily evaluated at baseline, end-of-treatment, and 2 weeks following treatment completion. RESULTS: No deleterious behavioral effects, discomfort, or physiologic changes resulted from 2 months of TEMT, as well as no evidence of tumor or microhemorrhage induction. TEMT induced clinically important and statistically significant improvements in ADAS-cog, as well as in the Rey AVLT. TEMT also produced increases in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of soluble Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, cognition-related changes in CSF oligomeric Aβ, a decreased CSF p-tau/Aβ1-42 ratio, and reduced levels of oligomeric Aβ in plasma. Pre- versus post-treatment FDG-PET brain scans revealed stable cerebral glucose utilization, with several subjects exhibiting enhanced glucose utilization. Evaluation of diffusion tensor imaging (fractional anisotropy) scans in individual subjects provided support for TEMT-induced increases in functional connectivity within the cognitively-important cingulate cortex/cingulum. CONCLUSION: TEMT administration to AD subjects appears to be safe, while providing cognitive enhancement, changes to CSF/blood AD markers, and evidence of stable/enhanced brain connectivity.

AB  - AIM: Dementia is a chronic, costly disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Effective, affordable person-centered interventions are required to improve the lived experiences of individuals with dementia and their caregivers in various care settings. The present study examined the effects of a person-centered music listening intervention on mood, agitation and social engagement for individuals living with dementia. METHODS: This quasi-experimental study was carried out with participants at five community-based adult day health centers (n = 51). Standardized instruments were used to measure mood and agitation, and in-person and video-recorded observations of participant behavior were used to analyze changes before, during and after the intervention across four domains: mood, agitation, connecting to music and engaging socially. Within-person differences were examined using the Wilcoxon signed rank test, and between-group differences were examined using the Mann-Whitney U-test. RESULTS: Although standardized instruments did not yield statistically significant results, the behavioral observations showed a positive change in mood and a decrease in agitation. From pre- to post-intervention, there were statistically significant increases in joy, eye contact, eye movement, being engaged and talkativeness, and a decrease in sleeping and moving or dancing. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral observations show the positive impact a person-centered music listening intervention might have on individuals living with dementia and attending adult day health centers. This affordable intervention provides a useful tool for caregivers that might improve the day-to-day experience of individuals living with dementia. Geriatr Gerontol Int 2019; 19: 30-34.

AB  - We investigated the contribution of group therapy delivered by a medical clown to young children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). So far, scientific publications regarding medical clowning focus on general health advantages. The current study is the first controlled research examining the use of medical clowning in the therapy for children with ASD. Twenty-four children aged 2-6 years old with ASD enrolled in our special education intensive program were examined before and after group sessions with clown intervention (CI) and other intervention (OI). We tested stereotypic behaviors, verbal expression, play reciprocity, and social smiles. Data was collected during 12 weeks of intervention, and the trajectory of change was evaluated in addition to the pre-/post-intervention.Conclusion: improvement over time in all measures: Significant increase in word production, play reciprocity, and amount of social smiles during CI as compared with OI. We also found a reduction in frequency of stereotypic behaviors during and following CI as compared with before CI. These preliminary results indicate that medical clowning may be beneficial for young children with ASD, since it promotes communication and social reciprocity in a fun and lively interventional setting. What is Known: • Many therapies are used and proven as efficacious interventions for children with ASD. • So far, medical clowning was not tested as an intervention or therapy for ASD. What is New: • Medical clowning sessions with children with ASD elicited enhanced communication during the interventions as compared with other interventions. • Medical clowning sessions contributed to a decrease in frequency of stereotypic movements over time, in children with ASD.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The combination of sleep deprivation and light therapy, called combined chronotherapy, may yield positive short- and long-term results, even in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). The implementation of combined chronotherapy in daily clinical practice is rare. This study describes the implementation and the effectiveness in a clinical setting. METHODS: Twenty six depressed patients with unipolar or bipolar depression received combined chronotherapy consisting of three nights of sleep deprivation with alternating recovery nights, light therapy, and continuation of antidepressant medication. Inventory of Depressive Symptoms C (IDS-C) scores were determined before chronotherapy and at week 1, 2, and 4. Paired t-tests were used to compare the IDS-C scores over time. RESULTS: The mean pre-treatment IDS-C score was 39.3 ± 9.6, the mean score in week 2 was 28.4 ± 10.2, and 28.6 ± 14.0 in week 4. A subsample of patients with psychiatric co-morbidities showed a reduction in depression severity from a mean score of 42.9 ± 11.0 to a mean score of 34.9 ± 13.0 after 4 weeks. The overall response rate was 34.6%, the remission rate 19.2%. LIMITATIONS: This open label case series has a relative small sample size and no control group CONCLUSION: In a clinical setting patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder benefited significantly from combined chronotherapy. This chronotherapeutic intervention appears to have a rapid effect that lasts for at least several weeks, even in patients with psychiatric comorbidity or TRD. Indicating that chronotherapy can be a valuable treatment addition for depressed patients.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to test the effects of a customized intervention on distress among caregivers of persons with dementia (PWD) using a quasi-experimental design. Method: Fifty-one spouse caregivers in the experimental group and 51 in the control group participated in the study. The effects of the intervention were examined by comparing caregivers' responses with questionnaires at pre-intervention baseline (T0) and immediately after intervention (T1). Differences were quantified using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results: The analyses indicated a stabilizing effect of the intervention on caregivers' perceptions of PWD's daily functioning, self-esteem related to caregiving, quality of family support, and feeling of distress. Linear increases were observed regarding sense of preparedness and impact on daily routine, while no differences (interaction and linear effects) were observed for degree of self-efficacy, depression, impact on finances, or self-rated health. Conclusion: These findings show a preliminary efficacy of the intervention proposed in this study to prevent the exacerbation of caregivers' distress.

AB  - This study evaluates the effectiveness of traditional Chinese opera on older adults with dementia; those who met the inclusion criteria were categorized into intervention (n = 21) and control (n = 22) groups. Traditional Chinese opera was organized for the intervention group for 12 weeks. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Chinese version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (CNPI), and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) assessed the effectiveness at the pre-test stage and after 6 and 12 weeks of the intervention, and generalized estimated equation was used for statistical analysis. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed between the intervention and control groups in terms of MMSE, CNPI, and QOL-AD. Traditional Chinese opera can potentially be an effective therapy for improving the cognitive function of older adults with dementia, reducing their behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and enhancing their quality of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preliminary clinical studies on the safety and efficacy of the pipeline embolization device (PED) for the treatment of small/medium aneurysms have demonstrated high occlusion rates with low complications. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the PED for treatment of wide necked small and medium intracranial aneurysms. METHODS: PREMIER is a prospective, multicenter, single arm trial. Patients were treated with the PED for unruptured wide necked aneurysms, measuring ≤12 mm along the internal carotid artery or vertebral artery, between July 2014 and November 2015. At 1 year post-procedure, the primary effectiveness endpoint was complete occlusion (Raymond grade 1) without major parent vessel stenosis (≤50%) or retreatment, and the primary safety endpoint was major stroke in the territory supplied by the treated artery or neurologic death. RESULTS: A total of 141 patients were treated with PEDs (mean age 54.6±11.3 years, 87.9% (124/141) women). Mean aneurysm size was 5.0±1.92 mm, and 84.4% (119/141) measured <7 mm. PED placement was successful in 99.3% (140/141) of patients. Mean number of PEDs implanted per patient was 1.1±0.26; a single PED was used in 92.9% (131/141) of patients. At 1 year, 97.9% (138/141) of patients underwent follow-up angiography with 76.8% (106/138) of patients having met the study's primary effectiveness endpoint. The combined major morbidity and mortality rate was 2.1% (3/140). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of wide necked small/medium aneurysms with the PED results in high rates of complete occlusion without significant parent vessel stenosis and low rates of permanent neurologic complications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined the benefits of a community-based program combining physical exercise, cognitive training, and education on dementia and lifestyle habits. METHODS: This crossover open-label trial included 141 community-dwelling elderly people with suspected mild cognitive decline (MCD). Subjects were assigned to a 6-month intervention-first/6-month observation-second (INT-OBS) group or an OBS-INT group. The 6-month intervention consisted of 2 h of physical exercise, cognitive training, and classroom study or rest once weekly. Primary outcome was change in Touch Panel-type Dementia Assessment Scale (TDAS) score. RESULTS: TDAS score improved significantly during the intervention period compared with the observation period for all subjects (P < 0.05). Some physical functions also improved significantly during the intervention period compared with the observation period in the OBS-INT group (P < 0.05). INTERPRETATION: This community-based program improved both cognitive and physical function in elderly people with suspected MCD.

AB  - Background. Disrupted sleep is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) particularly in the inpatient rehabilitation setting where it may affect participation in therapy and outcomes. Treatment of sleep disruption in this setting is varied and largely unexamined. Objective. To study the feasibility of instituting a sleep hygiene intervention on a rehabilitation unit. Methods. Twenty-two individuals admitted to a brain injury unit were enrolled and allocated, using minimization, to either a sleep hygiene protocol (SHP) or standard of care (SOC). All participants wore actigraphs, underwent serial cognitive testing, and had light monitors placed in their hospital rooms for 4 weeks. Additionally, participants in the SHP received 30 minutes of blue-light therapy each morning, had restricted caffeine intake after noon, and were limited to 30-minute naps during the day. SHP participants had their lights out time set according to preinjury sleep time preference. Both groups were treated with the same restricted formulary of centrally acting medications. Results. Of 258 patients screened, 27 met all study inclusion criteria of whom 22 were enrolled. Nine participants in each group who had at least 21 days of treatment were retained for analysis. The protocol was rated favorably by participants, families, and staff. Actigraph sleep metrics improved in both groups during the 4-week intervention; however, only in the SHP was the change significant. Conclusions. Sleep hygiene is a feasible, nonpharmacologic intervention to treat disrupted sleep in a TBI inpatient rehabilitation setting. A larger study is warranted to examine treatment efficacy.

AB  - Despite growing prevalence, research investigating occupational therapy incorporating horses for youth with autism is limited. This study aimed to (a) pilot a screening, evaluation, and intervention protocol of occupational therapy in an equine environment and (b) assess preliminary effects on occupational performance goals, behavior, and social functioning of youth with autism. A multiple baseline single-case experimental design was used. Six youth with autism participated in a no-treatment baseline phase and 10 weeks of intervention. Therapists implemented the intervention with 95% fidelity. Per parent report, participants improved in occupational performance goals, social motivation, and communication; four demonstrated decreased irritability and hyperactivity. This research operationalizes a screening, evaluation, and intervention protocol for occupational therapy in an equine environment, and demonstrates it may improve occupational, behavioral, and social outcomes for youth with autism. Next steps include manualizing the intervention, refining feasibility measures, and implementing a randomized controlled efficacy study.

AB  - Disorders of communication, social relationships, and psychomotricity are often characterized by cognitive impairment, which hinders daily activities and increases the risk of falls. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of an animal-assisted therapy (AAT) program in an institutionalized geriatric population with cognitive impairment. The variables evaluated included level of communication and changes in gait and/or balance. We performed a two-arm, parallel controlled, open-label, nonrandomized cluster clinical trial in two nursing home centers from an urban area. Patients in the two centers received 12 weekly sessions of physiotherapy, but the experimental group included AAT with a therapy dog. The study included a total of 46 patients (23 Control Group [CG], 23 Experimental Group [EG]) with a median age of 85.0 years. Of these, 32.6% had mild-moderate cognitive decline (Global Deterioration Scale of Reisberg [GDS] 2-4) and 67.4% severe cognitive decline (GDS 5-6). After the intervention, patients in the CG and EG showed a statistically significant improvement in all the response variables. When comparing both groups, no statistically significant differences were found in any of the Tinetti scale results (measuring gait and balance). However, the communication of patients in the EG, measured on the Holden scale, showed a statistically significant greater improvement postintervention than that of patients in the CG. AAT can be useful as a complementary, effective treatment for patients with different degrees of cognitive decline.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Effective community-based programs to maintain health and well-being of adults with dementia are needed. This article describes the translation, implementation, and effectiveness of a multicomponent exercise plus behavioral/psychosocial intervention (Reducing Disability in Alzheimer's Disease-NorthWest [RDAD-NW]) conducted by staff in regional Area Agencies on Aging (AAAs). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Staggered multiple baseline design was used; 10 AAAs, 20 case managers, and 255 community-residing persons with dementia (PWDs), and family caregivers were enrolled. RDAD-NW was conducted in-home over 6 weeks with aerobic/endurance, strength, and balance/flexibility exercises, dementia education, training to increase pleasant events, and activator-behavior-consequence problem-solving approach. Outcomes included case manager treatment fidelity, and caregiver/PWD physical activity, restricted activity days, physical functioning, quality of life, and affect. RESULTS: RDAD-NW was successfully translated and implemented by AAA agency staff through their usual service provision mechanisms. Staff responded positively and delivered the program with a high degree of fidelity. Caregiver/PWD dyads also responded favorably engaging in both exercise and behavioral/psychosocial portions of the program. A total of 207 dyads (81%) completed the intervention and 140 (55%) completed the 13-month follow-up. PWD physical activity increased significantly pre- to posttreatment (p < .001, ES = .54), and 13 months (p < .01, ES = .21). Quality of life of PWD increased significantly pre- to posttreatment (p < .001, ES = .29); caregiver depression improved pre- to posttreatment (p = .01, ES = -.18). DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: RDAD-NW was successfully translated and implemented by AAA case managers and resulted in increased physical activity and improved behavioral and emotional outcomes of caregiver/PWDs. Results support continued dissemination and implementation of RDAD-NW. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01708304.

AB  - The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of a dog-assisted therapy intervention to enhance quality of life in persons with dementia institutionalized in a public care home and to study its effect on the use of psychotropic medications. A dog-assisted therapy intervention was designed, in which 34 residents of a public care home in Cuenca (Spain) participated. The participants were assigned to two groups, an experimental and a control group. The program consisted of one 50-min session per week during 9 months. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare post-training values between groups, using baseline values as covariates. Our findings do seem to support the hypothesis that Animal-Assisted Therapy may contribute to enhancing quality of life for residents in an aged care home. However, aspects such as the format, time, and content of the sessions as well as their possibilities of reducing psychotropic medication require more research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although add-on transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising intervention for treating unipolar (UD) and bipolar depression (BD), its moderate antidepressant efficacy urges research into biomarkers for predicting therapeutic response and achieving highly targeted applications. METHODS: This open-label trial enrolled UD (N=58) and BD (N=22) patients who had failed 1 or more trials of adequate pharmacologic interventions (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03287037). Bifrontal tDCS (anode/cathode: F3/F4) was applied using a 2 mA current for 20 min, twice daily, for 5 consecutive weekdays. Depression was measured with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale-17 (HAMD) at baseline, after 10-session stimulation, 1- and 4-week follow-ups. Heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) was measured at baseline, during the initial 5 min of the 1(st) session, after 10-session stimulation, 1- and 4-week follow-ups. Cognitive performance and other outcomes were also assessed. RESULTS: Bifrontal tDCS rapidly and equally improved depression in both groups. The effects persisted until the end of the trial. Both groups had similar improvements in cognitive performance, anxiety, and psychosocial functioning. Compared with baseline, increased vagally-mediated HRV was observed one month after tDCS for both groups. A positive correlation was found between HR deceleration within the 1(st) session and treatment response after 10-session tDCS only among UD patients, explaining 20% of the variance. CONCLUSION: tDCS as an adjunct therapy is effective for both UD and BD. Data suggest that the greater the increase in parasympathetic signaling during the 1(st) session, the better the clinical response after 10-session tDCS for UD patients.

AB  - An important period in the care of patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders is when they transition from inpatient to outpatient services and are at increased risk for relapse and rehospitalization. Thus, we developed and examined the initial feasibility, acceptability, and clinical effects of an mHealth transitions of care intervention (Mobile After-Care Support; MACS) in an open trial. Ten adults with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders were recruited during their index psychiatric hospitalization and enrolled prior to discharge. Measures of feasibility, acceptability, and MACS targets were administered at baseline and a 1-month follow-up. Drawing on skills from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Psychosis (CBTp), MACS delivered brief assessments of clinically relevant variables, followed by just-in-time interventions for patients starting immediately post-discharge. Individuals completed about one session per day on average as expected. Overall, measures of MACS usability and satisfaction were positive. T-test analyses showed that dysfunctional coping strategies significantly decreased from baseline to 1-month follow-up. Results also revealed statistically significant reductions in psychiatric symptoms over 1-month follow-up. This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of MACS, a new app-based intervention targeting transitions of care for patients with psychosis. The field is turning to the use of mobile technology as a means of augmenting service delivery and providing real-time assessment and intervention for patients at risk. MACS is a promising adjunctive intervention that warrants further testing in a randomized controlled trial.

AB  - Objective: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is highly effective for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) but may be associated with adverse cognitive effects. Magnetic seizure therapy (MST) is a promising alternative convulsive treatment with a safer cognitive profile. Although there is emerging evidence for the efficacy of MST for TRD as an acute treatment, there are no published studies of continuation MST for the prevention of relapse. Methods: Patients with TRD with a DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who met response criteria after acute MST were offered continuation MST in a prospective, open-label trial between February 2012 and June 2019. They received 12 continuation MST sessions with decreasing frequency over the course of 6 months, with additional booster sessions if their depression symptoms started to worsen. The primary outcome was relapse of depression or psychiatric hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included relapse of suicidal ideation and neurocognitive outcomes. Results: Thirty participants completing at least one assessment during continuation MST were included in the analysis; 10 (33.3%) relapsed, with no significant differences in survival distributions between unipolar and bipolar groups (χ(2) = 0.3, P = .58). Mean (SD) survival time was 18.6 (1.6) weeks. All 17 participants who achieved resolution of baseline suicidality after acute MST remained free of suicidality during the continuation phase. Except for improvement in verbal fluency, neurocognitive test scores did not change during continuation MST. Conclusions: During 6 months of continuation MST, two-thirds of participants sustained improvements in depressive symptoms without any adverse cognitive effects. Future studies of continuation MST are warranted, particularly in comparison to ECT. Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01596608.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: As there is currently no pharmacological treatment for Parkinson's Disease Mild Cognitive Impairment (PD-MCI) with executive dysfunctions, specific cognitive interventions must be investigated. Most previous studies have tested bottom-up cognitive training programs but have not shown very good results. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to test ease of implementation, differential safety and preliminary efficacy of two top-down (strategy-learning) home-based, individualized, cognitive interventions: Goal Management Training (GMT), adapted for PD-MCI (Adapted-GMT), and a psychoeducation program combined with mindfulness exercises (PSYCH-Mind). METHODS: This was a single-blind block-randomized between-group comparative study. Twelve PD-MCI with mild executive dysfunctions were divided in four blocks and randomly assigned to any of the two interventions. The participants were included if they had PD-MCI diagnosis (no dementia), with stabilized medication. Both groups (Adapted-GMT and PSYCH-mind) received five intervention sessions each lasting 60-90 minutes for five weeks. Measures were collected at baseline, mid-point, one-week, four-week and 12-week follow-ups. Executive functions were assessed with the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) and the Zoo Map Test (ZMT). Quality of life (QoL) and psychiatric symptoms were also evaluated. Repeated measures ANCOVAs (mixed linear analysis) were applied to all outcomes. RESULTS: There was one drop out, and both interventions were feasible and acceptable. Despite the small sample size limiting statistical power, patients of both groups significantly improved executive functions per the DEX-patient (Time: F(4,36) = 2.96, p = 0.033, CI95%: 10.75-15.23) and DEX-caregiver scores (Time: F(4,36) = 6.02, p = 0.017, CI95%: 9.63-17.23). Both groups significantly made fewer errors between measurement times on the ZMT (Time: F(3,36) = 16.66, p = 0.001, CI95%: 1.07-2.93). However, QoL significantly increased only in PSYCH-Mind patients at four-week follow-up (interaction Time*Group: F(4,36) = 5.31, p = 0.002, CI95%: 15.33-25.61). CONCLUSION: Both interventions were easily implemented and proved to be safe. Because both interventions are arguably cost-effective, these pilot findings, although promising, need to be replicated in large samples. CLINICALTRIALS.GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT04636541.

AB  - PURPOSE: In manualized family-based treatment (FBT) for eating disorders, phase 1 of the 3-phase treatment-during which parents are put in control of eating-related issues-is perhaps the most critical phase, and is comprehensively addressed in the manual. Phase 2, during which control over eating is gradually returned to the patient, is more variable and the manual dedicates less space to this phase. The purpose of the current exploratory study was to assess Phase 2 practices of clinicians providing FBT and to compare these practices to the guidance offered in the manual. METHODS: In the current study, a survey assessing Phase 2 practices was sent to clinicians. Twenty-seven providers responded. Two providers reported that they did not provide FBT in an outpatient setting. One reported not currently providing outpatient FBT but had in the past. The remaining providers were currently providing FBT in an outpatient setting. RESULTS: No items addressing the core interventions of Phase 2, including encouraging age-appropriate independent eating, were endorsed by 100% of respondents as being addressed 100% of the time in Phase 2. CONCLUSION: Responses reflected some adherence to the manual, along with examples of therapist drift and incorporation of therapeutic interventions that are not described in the FBT manual. Adherence to manualized treatments may improve outcome for some patients, while allowing for flexibility to address clinical situations that are not addressed in the manual. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V. Opinions of respected authorities, based on descriptive studies, narrative reviews, clinical experience, or reports of expert committees.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a life-threatening illness. Sometimes long inpatient treatment is necessary, increasing the anxiety that comes with hospitalization and the necessary weight gain. Safe, non-pharmacological adjunctive therapies that improve subjective health are called for. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this non-randomized, mixed-methods observational study was to describe the utilization rate and nurses' experiences of ear acupuncture in a highly specialized clinic for eating disorders in Sweden, in which acupuncture had been implemented as part of routine clinical care. Twenty-five patients with AN-treated voluntarily or by law were included. The semi-standardized National Acupuncture Detoxification Association (NADA) ear acupuncture protocol, sometimes combined with needling at 2 traditional acupuncture point locations on the body, had been implemented as a voluntary adjunct to usual care, twice weekly. To evaluate the acceptance of acupuncture, the study examined how often patients chose acupuncture when offered on schedule, and how often they asked for extra acupuncture sessions. Patients rated their subjective health using the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) and visual analogue scale (VAS), treatment satisfaction with usual care and acupuncture, and health-related quality of life with the RAND36 instrument. A credibility/expectancy questionnaire (CEQ) was used to measure confidence in treatment. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated to follow the patients' recovery. Nurses' experiences of giving acupuncture as a part of routine care were captured in interviews, and analysed with content analysis. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Despite an initially moderate level of trust in acupuncture, the utilization rate of the scheduled acupuncture was 89% and patients asked for extra acupuncture sessions on 28 occasions. No serious side effects were reported. Nurses' experiences of providing acupuncture were positive. They were generally enthusiastic, although they reported finding it difficult to organize group treatments and to find time for acupuncture sessions if they were not scheduled. CONCLUSION: Further research into the effectiveness and costs of acupuncture in psychiatric care is needed. This study provides relevant information for clinicians as well as researchers planning future randomized controlled trials.
