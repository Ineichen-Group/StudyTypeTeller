76,77,rayyan-1277750766,Gen Hosp Psychiatry,A randomized trial of psychiatric consultation with distressed high utilizers,"This study reports the results of a randomized trial of a psychiatric consultation intervention with distressed, high utilizing patients of 18 physicians in two primary care clinics. Psychiatric consultation was associated with a significant increase in the use of antidepressants in intervention patients compared with controls in the first 6 months after intervention. Intervention patients were also significantly more likely to continue antidepressant treatment than control patients. The primary care physicians receiving psychiatric consultations increased the rate of prescribing antidepressant medications in their practice from 32 prescriptions filled per 1,000 visits before their participation in four consultations to 44 new prescriptions per 1,000 visits in the 12-month period after. There were no significant differences between intervention patients and controls at 6 and 12 months after randomization in psychiatric distress, functional disability, or utilization of health care (ambulatory visits, radiographic and laboratory testing services, admissions to inpatient medical care).",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
77,78,rayyan-1277759348,Psychother Psychosom,Four-Week Mentalizing Imagery Therapy for Family Dementia Caregivers: A Randomized Controlled Trial with Neural Circuit Changes,"INTRODUCTION: Family caregivers of patients with dementia suffer a high burden of depression and reduced positive emotions. Mentalizing imagery therapy (MIT) provides mindfulness and guided imagery skills training to improve balanced mentalizing and emotion regulation. OBJECTIVE: Our aims were to test the hypotheses that MIT for family caregivers would reduce depression symptoms and improve positive psychological traits more than a support group (SG), and would increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) connectivity and reduce subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) connectivity. METHODS: Forty-six caregivers participated in a randomized controlled trial comparing a 4-week MIT group (n = 24) versus an SG (n = 22). Resting state neuroimaging was obtained at baseline and post-group in 28 caregivers, and questionnaires completed by all participants. The primary outcome was change in depression; secondary measures included anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being. Brain networks with participation of DLPFC and sgACC were identified. Connectivity strengths of DLPFC and sgACC with respective networks were determined with dual regression. DLPFC connectivity was correlated with mindfulness and depression outcomes. RESULTS: MIT significantly outperformed SG in improving depression, anxiety, mindfulness, self-compassion, and well-being, with moderate to large effect sizes. Relative to SG, participants in MIT showed significant increases in DLPFC connectivity - exactly replicating pilot study results - but no change in sgACC. DLPFC connectivity change correlated positively with mindfulness and negatively with depression change. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, MIT was superior to SG for reducing depression and anxiety symptoms and improving positive psychological traits. Neuroimaging results suggested that strengthening DLPFC connectivity with an emotion regulation network might be mechanistically related to MIT effects.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

A shared deficient serotonergic transmission was postulated for both syndromes. The left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex was argued to regulate eating behaviour and to be dysfunctional in eating disorders. METHODS: Fourteen women meeting DSM-IV criteria for BN were included in a randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial. In order to exclude patients highly responsive to placebo, all patients were first submitted to a one-week sham treatment. Randomisation was followed by 3 weeks of active treatment or sham stimulation. As the main outcome criterion we defined the change in binges and purges. Secondary outcome variables were the decrease of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time. RESULTS: The average number of binges per day declined significantly between baseline and the end of treatment in the two groups. There was no significant difference between sham and active stimulation in terms of purge behaviour, BDI, HDRS and YBOCS over time. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results indicate that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in the treatment of BN does not exert additional benefit over placebo. A larger number of patients might clarify a further role of rTMS in the treatment of BN.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
79,80,rayyan-1277750203,Br Med J,Controlled trial of treatment for cerebral concussion,"In a study designed to compare two types of treatment of cerebral concussion, 178 patients were allocated to a routine treatment or to an active treatment group; in the latter a good prognosis was emphasized, the patient was mobilized early and given physiotherapy. In the routine treatment group the average time off work was 32 days compared with 18 days in the active treatment group. Physiotherapy seemed to be particularly valuable in old patients and in those with exaggerated fears about their condition. It is suggested that throughout their illness and follow-up, patients with cerebral concussion should be under the care of one doctor, one who is particularly interested in the subject and that more propaganda is needed",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
81,82,rayyan-1277759869,Gerontologist,A Randomized Control Trial for ReDeSign: A Dementia-Friendly Mobile Microlearning Training for Store Workers in Japan,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dementia-friendly training should be incorporated in neighborhood stores for people living with dementia to maintain engagement in social activities. However, there is a lack of evidence of dementia-friendly training in these workplaces, and existing trainings have time constraints. We developed a mobile microlearning program based on stigma theory and the bystander intervention model. This study aimed to evaluate the microlearning program's effectiveness. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Convenience store workers in Tokyo were recruited for a randomized, waiting-list, and controlled trial. The intervention group completed a 50-min online course. The primary outcome was an attitude toward people living with dementia. The secondary outcomes were knowledge of dementia and helping behavior toward customers suspected of having dementia. Data were collected at baseline, after 1 month, and 4 months following the randomization. RESULTS: Process evaluations confirmed satisfaction and high completion rates of the program. In total, 150 participants were included in the analysis. The intervention group showed significantly greater improvements in attitude (Hedge's g = 0.70) and knowledge (g = 0.59) after 1 month, compared to the control group. Helping behavior increased in the intervention group, although it did not differ significantly between the groups. All outcomes remained significantly improved after 4 months. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: The findings provide evidence that dementia-friendly training reduces the general public's stigma and increases helping behavior in stores. Mitigation of time constraints through mobile microlearning is expected to contribute to the dissemination and help people living with dementia maintain their social participation in the communities.

82,83,rayyan-1277759676,Jama,Remote Ischemic Conditioning for Acute Stroke: The RESIST Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Despite some promising preclinical and clinical data, it remains uncertain whether remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) with transient cycles of limb ischemia and reperfusion is an effective treatment for acute stroke. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of RIC when initiated in the prehospital setting and continued in the hospital on functional outcome in patients with acute stroke. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a randomized clinical trial conducted at 4 stroke centers in Denmark that included 1500 patients with prehospital stroke symptoms for less than 4 hours (enrolled March 16, 2018, to November 11, 2022; final follow-up, February 3, 2023). INTERVENTION: The intervention was delivered using an inflatable cuff on 1 upper extremity (RIC cuff pressure, ≤200 mm Hg [n = 749] and sham cuff pressure, 20 mm Hg [n = 751]). Each treatment application consisted of 5 cycles of 5 minutes of cuff inflation followed by 5 minutes of cuff deflation. Treatment was started in the ambulance and repeated at least once in the hospital and then twice daily for 7 days among a subset of participants. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was improvement in functional outcome measured as a shift across the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score (range, 0 [no symptoms] to 6 [death]) at 90 days in the target population with a final diagnosis of ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke. RESULTS: Among 1500 patients who were randomized (median age, 71 years; 591 women [41%]), 1433 (96%) completed the trial. Of these, 149 patients (10%) were diagnosed with transient ischemic attack and 382 (27%) with a stroke mimic. In the remaining 902 patients with a target diagnosis of stroke (737 [82%] with ischemic stroke and 165 [18%] with intracerebral hemorrhage), 436 underwent RIC and 466 sham treatment. The median mRS score at 90 days was 2 (IQR, 1-3) in the RIC group and 1 (IQR, 1-3) in the sham group. RIC treatment was not significantly associated with improved functional outcome at 90 days (odds ratio [OR], 0.95; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.20, P = .67; absolute difference in median mRS score, -1; -1.7 to -0.25). In all randomized patients, there were no significant differences in the number of serious adverse events: 169 patients (23.7%) in the RIC group with 1 or more serious adverse events vs 175 patients (24.3%) in the sham group (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.85 to 1.11; P = .68). Upper extremity pain during treatment and/or skin petechia occurred in 54 (7.2%) in the RIC group and 11 (1.5%) in the sham group. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: RIC initiated in the prehospital setting and continued in the hospital did not significantly improve functional outcome at 90 days in patients with acute stroke.

84,85,rayyan-1277751875,J Consult Clin Psychol,A controlled study of virtual reality exposure therapy for the fear of flying,"Fear of flying (FOF) affects an estimated 10-25% of the population. Patients with FOF (N = 49) were randomly assigned to virtual reality exposure (VRE) therapy, standard exposure (SE) therapy, or a wait-list (WL) control. Treatment consisted of 8 sessions over 6 weeks, with 4 sessions of anxiety management training followed by either exposure to a virtual airplane (VRE) or exposure to an actual airplane at the airport (SE). A posttreatment flight on a commercial airline measured participants' willingness to fly and anxiety during flight immediately after treatment. The results indicated that VRE and SE were both superior to WL, with no differences between VRE and SE. The gains observed in treatment were maintained at a 6-month follow up. By 6 months posttreatment, 93% of VRE participants and 93% of SE participants had flown. VRE therapy and SE therapy for treatment of FOF were unequivocally supported in this controlled study.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
87,88,rayyan-1277756114,Am J Geriatr Psychiatry,A multidimensional home-based care coordination intervention for elders with memory disorders: the maximizing independence at home (MIND) pilot randomized trial,"OBJECTIVES: To assess whether a dementia care coordination intervention delays time to transition from home and reduces unmet needs in elders with memory disorders. DESIGN: 18-month randomized controlled trial of 303 community-living elders. SETTING: 28 postal code areas of Baltimore, MD. PARTICIPANTS: Age 70+ years, with a cognitive disorder, community-living, English-speaking, and having a study partner available. INTERVENTION: 18-month care coordination intervention to systematically identify and address dementia-related care needs through individualized care planning; referral and linkage to services; provision of dementia education and skill-building strategies; and care monitoring by an interdisciplinary team. MEASUREMENTS: Primary outcomes were time to transfer from home and total percent of unmet care needs at 18 months. RESULTS: Intervention participants had a significant delay in time to all-cause transition from home and the adjusted hazard of leaving the home was decreased by 37% (Hazard ratio: 0.63, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.42-0.94) compared with control participants. Although there was no significant group difference in reduction of total percent of unmet needs from baseline to 18 months, the intervention group had significant reductions in the proportion of unmet needs in safety and legal/advance care domains relative to controls. Intervention participants had a significant improvement in self-reported quality of life (QOL) relative to control participants. No group differences were found in proxy-rated QOL, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or depression. CONCLUSIONS: A home-based dementia care coordination intervention delivered by non-clinical community workers trained and overseen by geriatric clinicians led to delays in transition from home, reduced unmet needs, and improved self-reported QOL.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
91,92,rayyan-1277755955,Psychol Med,Comparison of non-directive counselling and cognitive behaviour therapy for patients presenting in general practice with an ICD-10 depressive episode: a randomized control trial,"BACKGROUND: Most evidence in the UK on the effectiveness of brief therapy for depression concerns cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). In a trial published in 2000, we showed that non-directive counselling and CBT were equally effective in general practice for patients with depression and mixed anxiety and depression. Our results were criticized for including patients not meeting diagnostic criteria for a depressive disorder. In this reanalysis we aimed to compare the effectiveness of the two therapies for patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode. METHOD: Patients with an ICD-10 depressive episode or mixed anxiety and depression were randomized to counselling, CBT or usual general practitioner (GP) care. Counsellors provided nondirective, interpersonal counselling following a manual that we developed based on the work of Carl Rogers. Cognitive behaviour therapists provided CBT also guided by a manual. Modelling was carried out using generalized estimating equations with the multiply imputed datasets. Outcomes were mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory, Brief Symptom Inventory, and Social Adjustment Scale at 4 and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 134 participants were randomized to CBT, 126 to counselling and 67 to usual GP care. We undertook (1) an interaction analysis using all 316 patients who were assigned a diagnosis and (2) a head-to-head comparison using only those 130 (41%) participants who had an ICD-10 depressive episode at baseline. CBT and counselling were both superior to GP care at 4 months but not at 12 months. There was no difference in the effectiveness of the two psychological therapies. CONCLUSIONS: We recommend that national clinical guidelines take our findings into consideration in recommending effective alternatives to CBT.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
92,93,rayyan-1277751902,Int J Aging Hum Dev,Prognostic factors of effectiveness of a support program for caregivers of dementia patients,"In a randomized controlled study, positive effects were found of a support program for caregivers of dementia patients. The aim of this study is to identify in a secondary analysis the prognostic factors of success of the support program by comparing characteristics of patients and primary caregivers for whom the support program was effective with those for whom the program was not effective (n = 49 pairs of patients and caregivers). The theoretically based individualized support program which is presented in this article, was most effective with regard to primary caregivers' sense of competence for females sharing a household with the dementia patient. The program was most effective in reducing the number of patient admissions when patients did not receive support from a district nurse and the primary caregivers experienced less emotional support from the informal network. A proactive approach by offering this flexible support before caregivers ask for support may prolong the stage in which they feel able to care for patients at home. Offering this support to females, who usually are supposed to care for the patient without assistance, may be both effective and efficient.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
265,266,rayyan-1270414133,Cell Signal,Homer1 knockdown protects dopamine neurons through regulating calcium homeostasis in an in vitro model of Parkinson's disease,"Homer1 protein is an important scaffold protein at postsynaptic density and has been demonstrated to play a central role in calcium signaling in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of Homer1 knockdown on MPP(+) induced neuronal injury in cultured dopamine (DA) neurons. We found that down-regulating Homer1 expression with specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly suppressed LDH release, reduced Propidium iodide (PI) or Hoechst staining, increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) positive cells and DA uptake, and attenuated apoptotic and necrotic cell death after MPP(+) injury. Homer1 knockdown decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation through inhibition of intracellular calcium overload, but did not affect the endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities. Calcium imaging was used to examine the changes of intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]cyt) and Ca(2+) in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) ([Ca(2+)]ER), and the results showed that Homer1 siRNA transfection attenuated ER Ca(2+) release up to 120min after MPP(+) injury. Furthermore, decrease of [Ca(2+)]cyt induced by Homer1 knockdown in MPP(+) treated neurons was further enhanced by NMDA receptor antagonists MK-801 and AP-5, but not canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channel antagonist SKF-96365. l-type calcium antagonist isradipine but not nimodipine further inhibited intracellular calcium overload after MPP(+) insult in Homer1 down-regulated neurons. These results suggest that Homer1 knockdown has protective effects against neuronal injury in in vitro PD model by reducing calcium overload mediated ROS generation, and this protection may be dependent at least in part on the regulatory effects on the function of calcium channels in both plasma membrane and ER.",In-vitro-study,8,0
269,270,rayyan-1270417275,J Cancer Res Clin Oncol,Selective induction of rapid cytotoxic effect in glioblastoma cells by oscillating magnetic fields,"PURPOSE: The mechanisms underlying anticancer effects of electromagnetic fields are poorly understood. An alternating electric field-generating therapeutic device called Optune™ device has been approved for the treatment of glioblastoma (GBM). We have developed a new device that generates oscillating magnetic fields (OMF) by rapid rotation of strong permanent magnets in specially designed patterns of frequency and timing and have used it to treat an end-stage recurrent GBM patient under an expanded access/compassionate use treatment protocol. Here, we ask whether OMF causes selective cytotoxic effects in GBM and whether it is through generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). METHODS: We stimulated patient derived GBM cells, lung cancer cells, normal human cortical neurons, astrocytes, and bronchial epithelial cells using OMF generators (oncoscillators) of our Oncomagnetic Device and compared the results to those obtained under unstimulated or sham-stimulated control conditions. Quantitative fluorescence microscopy was used to assess cell morphology, viability, and ROS production mechanisms. RESULTS: We find that OMF induces highly selective cell death of patient derived GBM cells associated with activation of caspase 3, while leaving normal tissue cells undamaged. The cytotoxic effect of OMF is also seen in pulmonary cancer cells. The underlying mechanism is a marked increase in ROS in the mitochondria, possibly in part through perturbation of the electron flow in the respiratory chain. CONCLUSION: Rotating magnetic fields produced by a new noninvasive device selectively kill cultured human glioblastoma and non-small cell lung cancer cells by raising intracellular reactive oxygen species, but not normal human tissue cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0
270,271,rayyan-1270415501,J Virol Methods,A simple method for isolation of cell-associated viral particles from cell culture,"A common method for cell-associated virus isolation involves disruption of infected cells by a combination of hypotonic burst, freeze-thaw cycles (F-T) and sonication. This protocol was also originally used for the preparation of cell-free extract containing the MX strain of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), which is preferentially propagated by cell-to-cell contact and does not release distinct virions into the medium. In the present study, we compared different approaches to virus isolation. Based on virus yield, we show that deionized water lysis is the fastest and most effective method for releasing LCMV MX infectious viral particles from persistently infected cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that freeze-thaw cycles and sonication do not improve virus isolation. This simple protocol could be used for isolation of other viruses, the life cycle of which is strictly cell-associated and therefore are difficult to release in large amounts from host cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0
272,273,rayyan-1270415206,Exp Biol Med (Maywood),Penetration and intracellular uptake of poly(glycerol-adipate) nanoparticles into three-dimensional brain tumour cell culture models,"Nanoparticle (NP) drug delivery systems may potentially enhance the efficacy of therapeutic agents. It is difficult to characterize many important properties of NPs in vivo and therefore attempts have been made to use realistic in vitro multicellular spheroids instead. In this paper, we have evaluated poly(glycerol-adipate) (PGA) NPs as a potential drug carrier for local brain cancer therapy. Various three-dimensional (3-D) cell culture models have been used to investigate the delivery properties of PGA NPs. Tumour cells in 3-D culture showed a much higher level of endocytic uptake of NPs than a mixed normal neonatal brain cell population. Differences in endocytic uptake of NPs in 2-D and 3-D models strongly suggest that it is very important to use in vitro 3-D cell culture models for evaluating this parameter. Tumour penetration of NPs is another important parameter which could be studied in 3-D cell models. The penetration of PGA NPs through 3-D cell culture varied between models, which will therefore require further study to develop useful and realistic in vitro models. Further use of 3-D cell culture models will be of benefit in the future development of new drug delivery systems, particularly for brain cancers which are more difficult to study in vivo.",In-vitro-study,8,0
274,275,rayyan-1270414085,Brain Res,Expression of CD200 in alternative activation of microglia following an excitotoxic lesion in the mouse hippocampus,"CD200 is a glycoprotein that is expressed on the surfaces of neurons and other cells. It interacts with its receptor, CD200R, which is expressed on cells of the myeloid lineage, including microglia. The interaction of CD200 with its receptor plays a significant role in maintaining microglia in a quiescent state; thus, a decrease in CD200 expression in the brain is associated with evidence of microglial activation. However, their roles in pathological progression remain unclear. We examined the expression of CD200 in kainic acid (KA)-induced neurodegeneration of the mouse hippocampus. Our quantitative analysis revealed that CD200 was constitutively expressed in the normal brain and transiently upregulated by KA treatment. At the cellular level, CD200 was expressed in neurons in control, and was upregulated primarily in the microglia of KA-treated mouse hippocampi. We examined the contribution of CD200 to both the classical and alternative activation of microglia in vitro using an adult microglia culture, which was exposed to interleukin-4 (IL-4) with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CD200 expression was increased after exposure to IL-4, but not to LPS. These in vivo experiments demonstrated that CD200 was transiently expressed in microglia in a process mediated by the inflammatory response. Based on CD200R expression in microglia, it suggests that microglia is maintained in an activated state with autocrine signaling by interactions between microglial CD200 and its CD200R. Moreover, we suggest that CD200 may be expressed in the alternative activation of microglia and play a beneficial role in neuroinflammation.",In-vitro-study,8,0
278,279,rayyan-1270413921,Med Chem,Cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs and heterocyclic compounds at application on the cells of primary culture of neuroepithelium tumors,"Neuroepithelial tumor cells were cultured in vitro. The biopsy material was taken from 93 children at removal of the brain tumors during neurosurgical operations. The individual features of the cells sensitivity of primary cultures in respect to protocol-approved chemotherapy drugs and changes in the Interleukin-6 (Il-6) level in the culture medium after the application of chemotherapy were established. The initial level of Il-6 exceeded 600.0 pg/ml in the cultural medium with histologically verified pilomyxoid astrocytoma cells, and ranged from 100.0 to 200.0 pg/ml in the medium at cultivation of ganglioneuroblastoma and pilocytic astrocytoma. A decrease in the Il-6 level in the medium culture of primary tumors cells was observed after the application of chemotherapeutic agents on the cells of pilomyxoid astrocytoma, astrocytomas, and pilocytic desmoplastic/nodular medulloblastoma. The production of Il-6 increased after application of cytostatic drugs on the cells of oligoastrocytomas. A decrease in Il-6 level after application of Cisplatin and Methotrexate and a 5-10 fold increase in the level of Il-6 after application of Etoposide, Carboplatin, Cytarabine, and Gemcitabine were registered in the medium with ganglioneuroblastoma. To improve the cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents, the combined application of cytostatics with heterocyclic compounds was carried out. A computer modeling of ligand-protein complexes of carbamide using the Dock 6.4 and USF Chimera program packages was performed with molecular mechanics method. Special attention was drawn to the ability of several isoxazole heterocycles and isothiazolyl to inhibit the tyrosine kinase. It was proved in vitro that the joint application of chemotherapeutic agents and heterocyclic compounds could reduce the concentration of the cytostatic factor by 10 or more times, having maintained the maximum cytotoxic effect. It was assumed that the target amplification of cytotoxic action of chemotherapeutic agents had prospects for reducing toxic side effects of chemotherapy in vivo, which would be carried out only after the preclinical studies.",In-vitro-study,8,0
281,282,rayyan-1270414308,Toxicol Sci,L-BMAA induced ER stress and enhanced caspase 12 cleavage in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells at low nonexcitotoxic concentrations,"The cyanobacterial β-N-methylamino-L-alanine (L-BMAA) is described as a low-potency excitotoxin, possibly a factor in the increased incidence of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinsonism-dementia complex (PDC) in Guam. The latter association is intensively disputed, as L-BMAA concentrations required for toxic effects exceed those assumed to occur via food. The question thus was raised whether L-BMAA leads to neurodegeneration at nonexcitotoxic conditions. Using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, L-BMAA-transport, incorporation into proteins, and subsequent impairment of cellular protein homeostasis were investigated. Binding of L-BMAA to intracellular proteins, but no clear protein incorporation was detected in response to (14)C-L-BMAA exposures. Nevertheless, low L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 0.1mM, 48 h) increased protein ubiquitination, 20S proteasomal and caspase 12 activity, expression of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress marker CHOP, and enhanced phosphorylation of elf2α in SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, high L-BMAA concentrations (≥ 1mM, 48 h) increased reactive oxygen species and protein oxidization, which were partially ameliorated by coincubation with vitamin E. L-BMAA-mediated cytotoxicity was observable 48 h following ≥ 2mM L-BMAA treatment. Consequently, the data presented here suggest that low L-BMAA concentrations result in a dysregulation of the cellular protein homeostasis with ensuing ER stress that is independent from high-concentration effects such as excitotoxicity and oxidative stress. Thus, the latter could be a contributing factor in the onset and slow progression of ALS/PDC in Guam.",In-vitro-study,8,0
496,497,rayyan-1277756067,Neurology,Naltrexone for impulse control disorders in Parkinson disease: a placebo-controlled study,"OBJECTIVE: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson disease (PD) are common and can be difficult to manage. The objective of this study was to determine the efficacy and tolerability of naltrexone, an opioid antagonist, for the treatment of ICDs in PD. METHODS: Patients with PD (n = 50) and an ICD were enrolled in an 8-week, randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled study of naltrexone 50-100 mg/d (flexible dosing). The primary outcome measure was response based on the Clinical Global Impression-Change score, and the secondary outcome measure was change in symptom severity using the Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) ICD score. RESULTS: Forty-five patients (90%) completed the study. The Clinical Global Impression-Change response rate difference favoring naltrexone in completers was 19.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] -8.7% to 44.2%). While this difference was not significant (odds ratio=1.6, 95% CI 0.5-5.2, Wald χ2 [df]=0.5 [1], p=0.5), naltrexone treatment led to a significantly greater decrease in QUIP-RS ICD score over time compared with placebo (regression coefficient for interaction term in linear mixed-effects model=-7.37, F[df]=4.3 [1, 49], p=0.04). The estimated changes in QUIP-RS ICD scores from baseline to week 8 were 14.9 points (95% CI 9.9-19.9) for naltrexone and 7.5 points (95% CI 2.5-12.6) for placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Naltrexone treatment was not efficacious for the treatment of ICDs in PD using a global assessment of response, but findings using a PD-specific ICD rating scale support further evaluation of opioid antagonists for the treatment of ICD symptoms in PD. CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class I evidence that in patients with PD and an ICD, naltrexone does not significantly increase the probability of achieving response. However, the study lacked the precision to exclude an important difference in response rates.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
498,499,rayyan-1277751885,Arch Gen Psychiatry,"Olanzapine treatment of psychotic and behavioral symptoms in patients with Alzheimer disease in nursing care facilities: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. The HGEU Study Group","BACKGROUND: Patients with Alzheimer disease (AD) commonly exhibit psychosis and behavioral disturbances that impair patient functioning, create caregiver distress, and lead to institutionalization. This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of olanzapine in treating psychosis and/or agitation/aggression in patients with AD. METHODS: A multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 6-week study was conducted in 206 elderly US nursing home residents with AD who exhibited psychotic and/or behavioral symptoms. Patients were randomly assigned to placebo or a fixed dose of 5, 10, or 15 mg/d of olanzapine. The primary efficacy measure was the sum of the Agitation/Aggression, Hallucinations, and Delusions items (Core Total) of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Nursing Home version. RESULTS: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) produced significant improvement compared with placebo on the Core Total (-7.6 vs -3.7 [P<.001] and -6.1 vs -3. 7 [P =.006], respectively). Core Total improvement with olanzapine, 15 mg/d, was not significantly greater than placebo. The Occupational Disruptiveness score, reflecting the impact of patients' psychosis and behavioral disturbances on the caregiver, was significantly reduced in the 5-mg/d olanzapine group compared with placebo (-2.7 vs -1.5; P =.008). Somnolence was significantly more common among patients receiving olanzapine (25.0%-35.8%), and gait disturbance occurred in those receiving 5 or 15 mg/d (19.6% and 17.0%, respectively). No significant cognitive impairment, increase in extrapyramidal symptoms, or central anticholinergic effects were found at any olanzapine dose relative to placebo. CONCLUSION: Low-dose olanzapine (5 and 10 mg/d) was significantly superior to placebo and well tolerated in treating agitation/aggression and psychosis in this population of patients with AD.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over trial, patients with HD were randomly assigned to start treatment on either (-)-OSU6162 or placebo. After 4 weeks, those patients who initially received active drug were switched to placebo for another 4 weeks, and vice versa. During the first week the (-)-OSU6162 dose was 15 mg twice daily, during the second week 30 mg twice daily, and during the last 2 weeks 45 mg twice daily. Motor, cognitive, mental and social functions were rated by the clinical investigator or by self-assessment, using established rating scales. RESULTS: Fifteen patients fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria completed the study. (-)-OSU6162 was well tolerated by all patients and no adverse effects were observed. (-)-OSU6162 treatment significantly improved the Short Form 36 Vitality score, mainly due to an improvement of the individual item 'worn-out' (VT3). In addition, an improvement of depressive symptoms was found using Beck Depression Inventory. In contrast to a general trend of improvement in several non-motor variables only small and non-significant differences between (-)-OSU6162 and placebo were found regarding motor functions. CONCLUSIONS: (-)-OSU6162 offers promise for the treatment of HD, as a drug with good tolerability, capable of improving the patients' experienced non-motor functions such as energy and mood and thus alleviating symptoms of great importance for their quality of life.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The aetiology of EDS is probably multifactorial but is probably exacerbated by dopaminergic medications. Modafinil is a wake-promoting agent approved for use in narcolepsy, but it is often used to treat a variety of somnolent conditions. METHOD: A double blind, placebo controlled parallel design trial was conducted to assess the efficacy of modafinil (200-400 mg/day) for the treatment of EDS in PD. The primary efficacy measure was the Epworth Sleepiness (ES) scale score. Secondary efficacy points included the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Fatigue Severity Scale, the Hamilton Depression Scale, and the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). RESULTS: Of a total of 40 subjects (29 men, mean (SD) age 64.8 (11.3) years), randomised to modafinil or placebo, 37 completed the study. Modafinil failed to significantly improve ES scores compared with placebo (2.7 v 1.5 points improvement, respectively, p = 0.28). MSLT failed to improve with modafinil relative to placebo (-0.16 v -0.70, respectively, p = 0.14). UPDRS, global impressions, Fatigue Severity Scale, and Hamilton Depression Scale scores were unchanged. Adverse events were minimal. CONCLUSION: Modafinil failed to significantly improve EDS in PD compared with placebo. The drug did not alter motor symptoms in PD and was well tolerated.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The data were collected during a 52-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fixed dose, parallel-group, multicenter study. Patients were mildly to severely impaired and diagnosed with uncomplicated Alzheimer's disease or multi-infarct dementia according to ICD-10 and DSM-III-R criteria. The primary outcome measures included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Geriatric Evaluation by Relative's Rating Instrument (GERRI) and Clinical Global Impression of Change. From 309 patients included in the ITT analysis, 244 patients (76% for placebo and 73% for EGb) actually reached the 26th week visit. In comparison to the baseline values, the placebo group showed a statistically significant worsening in all domains of assessment, while the group receiving EGb was considered slightly improved on the cognitive assessment and the daily living and social behavior. Mean treatment differences favored EGb with 1.3 and 0.12 points, respectively, on the ADAS-Cog (p = 0.04) and the GERRI (p = 0.007). In the group receiving EGb, 26% of the patients achieved at least a 4-point improvement on the ADAS-Cog, compared to 17% with placebo (p = 0.04).

The efficacy as well as safety of aripiprazole in Western populations has been described. The objective of this study is to investigate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of aripiprazole and risperidone in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects in mainland China. METHOD: The 6-week, double-blind, randomized, parallel study was conducted in 5 medical centers in mainland China from November 2007 to March 2011. A total of 279 subjects with a primary DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia were randomly assigned (with a randomization ratio of 1:1) to aripiprazole (n=139) or risperidone (n=140). Efficacy measurements included the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total, positive, negative and general psychopathology subscale scores, and Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (CGI-S), and Improvement scale scores. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), weight gain, serum prolactin level, QTc interval, and self-reported adverse events were also assessed as measures of safety and tolerability. RESULTS: Both the aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed statistically significant improvement of PANSS total, positive, negative, general psychopathology subscale scores, and CGI-S scores from baseline to the endpoint (all p<0.01). Significant improvement was noted in the first week for both treatment groups. There were no significant differences in efficacy measurements between the two treatment groups. Mean change of PANSS total scores from baseline to the endpoint was -26.8±18.1 for aripiprazole and -30.0±17.7 for risperidone, (p=0.1475). The responder rate was 71% (n=99) and 76% (n=107) for aripiprazole and risperidone, respectively, (p=0.323). The incidences of EPS were similar in the aripiprazole (25%, n=35) and risperidone groups (24%, n=34), respectively (p=0.757). No clinically meaningful effects on QTc interval, QRS duration, or PR interval were observed in either treatment groups. However, the incidence of clinically significant weight gain (p=0.0118) and hyperprolactinemia (p<0.001) in the aripiprazole group was significantly lower than in the risperidone group. CONCLUSION: The study demonstrated that aripiprazole, as well as risperidone, had rapid and persistent efficacy for psychotic symptoms from the first week of therapy. There may be poor efficacy for aripiprazole compared with risperidone for overall improvement, but there were no significant differences in this study. Aripiprazole showed good tolerability with less weight gain and hyperprolactinemia compared with risperidone. The overall efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in Chinese Han schizophrenia subjects were similar to that reported in Western populations.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
508,509,rayyan-1277750295,Psychopharmacology (Berl),Pimozide in the treatment of newly admitted schizophrenic patients,"Pimozide, a specific dopamine blocking agent, was compared with chlorpromazine in a 4-week double-blind study of the treatment of 40 schizophrenic patients newly admitted to hospital through the emergency room. Dosage was adjusted according to therapeutic effect and during the final week ranged from 10--70 mg/day (median 30 mg/day) for pimozide and 600--1,500 mg/day (median 900 mg/day) for chlorpromazine. Pimozide was found to exert somewhat less of an overall therapeutic effect than chlorpromazine, particularly in highly agitated patients. Women responded better to either treatment than men. A weighted mean of the doses given to male and female patients during the final week suggests that in the treatment of acutely ill patients the mg dose equivalency of pimozide in terms of chlorpromazine is approximately 1:25, considerably lower than estimates from maintenance studies. Pimozide induced significantly more parkinsonian symptoms but less autonomic side effects than chlorpromazine. It is suggested that the weaker presynaptic dopamine blocking effect of pimozide might be responsible for its reduced potency in the treatment of acute schizophrenic symptoms.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
509,510,rayyan-1277752333,J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry,A randomised placebo controlled study to assess the effects of cholinergic treatment on muscarinic receptors in Alzheimer's disease,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects of cholinergic treatment on the muscarinic receptor in patients with Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: 12 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and six controls were studied. The patients underwent ADAS-COG psychometric assessment and SPECT brain imaging with (123)I quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), to demonstrate the postsynaptic muscarinic M1 receptor, before being randomised in a double blind study to receive either an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (donepezil) or placebo for four months. Following this, the ADAS-COG and the (123)I-QNB receptor scan were repeated. The controls were imaged on one occasion only. All image analyses were undertaken using SPM99. RESULTS: (123)I-QNB imaging showed a significant relation between baseline psychometric impairment and deficits on scanning. Both placebo and actively treated groups had reductions in (123)I-QNB uptake. Greater reductions in receptor binding were demonstrated in the placebo group than in those receiving active treatment. Intraindividual reproducibility of the (123)I-QNB imaging technique appeared highly robust. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that (123)I-QNB uptake is better preserved in Alzheimer's disease patients on cholinergic treatment than on placebo. Cholinergic treatment may play a neuroprotective role. Sequential (123)I-QNB imaging seems to be a powerful tool in monitoring the response of these receptors to disease modifying treatments.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The aim of this trial was to study the efficacy and tolerability of sertraline. METHOD: In 4 Swedish stroke centers, 123 patients (aged 70.7 +/- 9.9 years) were enrolled during the period September 1998 to January 2001 in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 26-week trial, at a mean of 128 +/- 97 days (range, 3-375 days) after stroke, if they fulfilled DSM-IV criteria of major depressive episode (N = 76) or minor depressive disorder (N = 47). The primary efficacy variable was a change in depression assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. The Emotional Distress Scale (EDS) was administered and the occurrence of emotionalism and quality of life (QoL) were assessed, as well as neurologic recovery. Efficacy analyses were intention-to-treat, short-term (week 6) and long-term (week 26). RESULTS: Of the 123 patients, 62 were treated with sertraline (50-100 mg/day) and 61 with placebo. Both groups improved substantially, with no differences between the treatments, either for major depressive episode or minor depressive disorder, or for short- or long-term antidepressant effect and neurologic outcome. EDS revealed a better outcome with sertraline at week 6 (p < .05). At week 26, the improvement in QoL was better in sertraline patients (p < .05) and there was a trend for emotionalism (p = .07). No serious side effects were seen. CONCLUSION: Poststroke depression as measured by a conventional depression rating scale improved over time irrespective of treatment. Positive effects specific to sertraline were identified in emotional distress, emotionalism, and QoL. The study indicates that poststroke emotional reactions comprise depression and other domains susceptible to pharmacologic therapy.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
511,512,rayyan-1270388840,Pilot Feasibility Stud,CanWalk: study protocol for a randomized feasibility trial of a walking intervention for people with recurrent or metastatic cancer,"BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of people in the UK are living with recurrent or metastatic cancer, many of whom experience reduced quality of life resulting from the physical and psychosocial consequences of cancer and its treatment. While drug treatments are important at alleviating some symptoms, there is increasing evidence of the benefits of exercise in enhancing quality of life and health outcomes. Walking is an inexpensive and accessible form of exercise. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated whether a walking intervention is sufficient to enhance quality of life and alleviate symptoms in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer across a range of tumor types. This paper describes the CanWalk study protocol, which aims to assess the feasibility and acceptability of undertaking a randomized controlled trial of a community-based walking program to enhance quality of life and well-being in people with recurrent or metastatic cancer. METHODS: A mixed methods feasibility study includes an exploratory two-center randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews. A minimum of 60 participants will be recruited from two London NHS Trusts and randomized 1:1 between the walking intervention and standard care using minimization. The walking intervention consists of the initial provision of written/online information followed by a short motivational interview. Participants are instructed to walk for 30 min on alternate days and attend an organized volunteer-led walk once a week. Half of all participants will be asked to use a pedometer. Postal questionnaires will be completed at baseline (pre-randomization) and at 6, 12 and 24 weeks. A subsample of participants and stakeholders will be interviewed at the end of the study. RESULTS: Primary outcomes will be the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and trial. A range of secondary outcome assessments needed to design a main study, including estimates of recruitment, adherence and variability in quality of life, will be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study will be used to refine the walking intervention, investigate the acceptability of the intervention and study design, and determine the most appropriate outcome measures thereby providing estimates of the factors needed to design the main study.

512,513,rayyan-1270389269,Trials,"Study protocol for a multi-center, randomized controlled trial to develop Japanese denture adhesive guidelines for patients with complete dentures: the Denture Adhesive Guideline trial: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Denture adhesives, characterized as medical products in 1935 by the American Dental Association, have been considered useful adjuncts for improving denture retention and stability. However, many dentists in Japan are hesitant to acknowledge denture adhesives in daily practice because of the stereotype that dentures should be inherently stable, without the aid of adhesives. The aim of this study is to verify the efficacy of denture adhesives to establish guidelines for Japanese users. The null hypothesis is that the application of denture adhesives, including the cream and powder types, or a control (isotonic sodium chloride solution) would not produce different outcomes nor would they differentially improve the set outcomes between baseline and day 4 post-application. METHODS: This ten-center, randomized controlled trial with parallel groups is ongoing. Three hundred edentulous patients with complete dentures will be allocated to three groups (cream-type adhesive, powder-type adhesive, and control groups). The participants will wear their dentures with the denture adhesive for 4 days, including during eight meals (three breakfasts, two lunches, and three dinners). The baseline measurements and final measurements for the denture adhesives will be performed on the first day and after breakfast on the fourth day. The primary outcome is a general satisfaction rating for the denture. The secondary outcomes are denture satisfaction ratings for various denture functions, occlusal bite force, resistance to dislodgement, masticatory performance, perceived chewing ability, and oral health-related quality of life. Between-subjects comparisons among the three groups and within-subjects comparisons of the pre- and post-intervention measurements will be performed. Furthermore, a multiple regression analysis will be performed. The main analyses will be based on the intention-to-treat principle. A sample size of 100 subjects per group, including an assumed dropout rate of 10 %, will be required to achieve 80 % power with a 5 % alpha level. DISCUSSION: This randomized clinical trial will provide information about denture adhesives to complete denture wearers, prosthodontic educators, and dentists in Japan. We believe this new evidence on denture adhesive use from Japan will aid dentists in their daily practice even in other countries. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01712802 .

Numerous studies found that a dysregulation of these mechanisms is associated with chronic pain conditions. In turn, such a patient's ""profile"" (increased TS and/or weakened CPM) could be used to recommend different pharmacological treatments. However, the procedure to evaluate these mechanisms is time-consuming and requires expensive equipment that is not available in the clinical setting. In this study, we aim to identify psychological, physiological and socio-demographic markers that could serve as proxies to allow healthcare professionals to identify these pain phenotypes in clinic, and consequently optimize pharmacological treatments. Method: We aim to recruit a healthy participant cohort (n = 360) and a chronic pain patient cohort (n = 108). Independent variables will include psychological questionnaires, pain measurements, physiological measures and sociodemographic characteristics. Dependent variables will include TS and CPM, which will be measured using quantitative sensory testing in a single session. We will evaluate one prediction model and two validation models (for healthy and chronic pain participants) using multiple regression analysis between TS/CPM and our independent variables. The significance thresholds will be set at p = 0.05, respectively. Perspectives: This study will allow us to develop a predictive model to compute the pain modulation profile of individual patients based on their biopsychosocial characteristics. The development of the predictive model is the first step toward the overarching goal of providing clinicians with a set of quick and cheap tests, easily applicable in clinical practice to orient pharmacological treatments.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of electrical stimulation-augmented virtual reality training in improving balance in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI). OVERVIEW OF LITERATURE: Individuals with iSCI often face significant balance and mobility impairments affecting their quality of life. Scientific studies focusing on standing balance training in the iSCI population are limited. Virtual reality-based balance training has shown positive results in several neurological populations. Electrical stimulation has also proved to be effective in improving voluntary muscle strength in partially paralyzed muscles after iSCI as well as promoting neuroplasticity. METHODS: Forty-eight iSCI participants will be recruited based on the inclusion criteria. The participants will be randomly assigned to any of the three groups: virtual reality-based balance training along with the electrical stimulation group, virtual reality-based balance training along with sham stimulation group, or virtual reality-based balance training group. The intervention will be delivered as 60-minute sessions, thrice a week for 4 weeks. RESULTS: The performance of the participants will be assessed using the lower extremity motor score, static and dynamic balance assessment using TechnoBody ProKin tilting platform and Berg Balance Scale, Walking Index for Spinal Cord Injury, and World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF at pre-intervention, after 4 weeks post-intervention, and at 1-month follow-up.

Transdiagnostic mechanisms, including trauma, personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation are considered relevant to the development and maintenance of mental health problems and therefore may play a role in individuals' reactions to the pandemic. Aim: To identify moderating and mediating factors associated with pandemic-related distress and mental health problems in adults and families, we aim to investigate the interactions of interpersonal trauma (childhood trauma and domestic violence), psychological capacities (personality functioning, mentalizing and emotion regulation) and pandemic-related adversity on psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we aim to investigate behavioral and cognitive consequences of the pandemic (e.g., media consumption, vaccination status, conspiracy beliefs). Methods: Using an online-based cross-sectional and longitudinal design, we will investigate a sample of adult participants recruited via online platforms in German-speaking countries over the course of 1 year with four measurements points via self-report instruments (personality functioning: PID5BF +; mentalizing: MentS, PRFQ; emotion regulation: DERS-SF; mental health problems: PHQ-9, GAD-7; a composite pandemic-related stress score). Structural equation and multi-level modeling will be performed for data analyses. Implications: This study will provide data on the moderating and mediating effects of trauma, personality functioning and mentalizing during the pandemic in a large community sample, particularly on vulnerable groups like families. Identifying transdiagnostic mechanisms of psychopathology in the course of a pandemic crisis may provide valuable insight for the development of pre- and intervention measures for potential psychological distress during and post the pandemic.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines are a potential vehicle to achieve this. A recent systematic review of implementation strategies of guideline dissemination concluded that there was a lack of evidence regarding effective strategies to promote the uptake of guidelines. Recommendations from this review, and other studies, have suggested the use of interventions that are theoretically based because these may be more effective than those that are not. An evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the management of acute low back pain was recently developed in Australia. This provides an opportunity to develop and test a theory-based implementation intervention for a condition which is common, has a high burden, and for which there is an evidence-practice gap in the primary care setting. AIM: This study aims to test the effectiveness of a theory-based intervention for implementing a clinical practice guideline for acute low back pain in general practice in Victoria, Australia. Specifically, our primary objectives are to establish if the intervention is effective in reducing the percentage of patients who are referred for a plain x-ray, and improving mean level of disability for patients three months post-consultation. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol describes the details of a cluster randomised controlled trial. Ninety-two general practices (clusters), which include at least one consenting general practitioner, will be randomised to an intervention or control arm using restricted randomisation. Patients aged 18 years or older who visit a participating practitioner for acute non-specific low back pain of less than three months duration will be eligible for inclusion. An average of twenty-five patients per general practice will be recruited, providing a total of 2,300 patient participants. General practitioners in the control arm will receive access to the guideline using the existing dissemination strategy. Practitioners in the intervention arm will be invited to participate in facilitated face-to-face workshops that have been underpinned by behavioural theory. Investigators (not involved in the delivery of the intervention), patients, outcome assessors and the study statistician will be blinded to group allocation.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

The incidence in Spain is 3.8% of all full-term pregnancies. The most common technique used to end the gestation in cases of non cephalic presentation is that of caesarian section, and although it provokes a lower rate of morbi-mortality than does vaginal delivery in such situations, there remains the possibility of traumatic injury to the foetal head and neck, while maternal morbidity is also increased. The application of heat (moxibustion) to an acupuncture point, in order to correct non cephalic presentation, has been practised in China since ancient times, but as yet there is insufficient evidence of its real effectiveness. METHODS/DESIGN: The experimental design consists of a multi-centre randomised controlled trial with three parallel arms, used to compare real moxibustion, sham moxibustion and the natural course of events, among pregnant women with a non cephalic presentation and a gestational duration of 33-35 weeks (estimated by echography). The participants in the trial will be blinded to both interventions. The results obtained will be analyzed by professionals, blinded with respect to the allocation to the different types of intervention. In addition, we intend to carry out a economic analysis. DISCUSSION: This trial will contribute to the development of evidence concerning moxibustion in the correction of non cephalic presentations. The primary outcome variable is the proportion of cephalic presentations at term. As secondary outcomes, we will evaluate the proportion of cephalic presentations at week 38 of gestation, determined by echography, together with the safety of the technique, the specificity of moxibustion and the control of the blinding process.

Recent estimates suggest that the annual economic costs of alcohol in Australia are up to AUD $36 billion. Policies influencing price have been demonstrated to be very effective in reducing alcohol consumption and alcohol-related harms. Interest in minimum pricing has gained traction in recent years. However, there has been little research investigating the level of support for the public interest case of minimum pricing in Australia. OBJECTIVE: This article describes protocol for a study exploring Western Australian (WA) public knowledge, understanding, and reaction to a proposed minimum price policy per standard drink. METHODS: The study will employ a qualitative methodological design. Participants will be recruited from a wide variety of backgrounds, including ethnic minorities, blue and white collar workers, unemployed, students, and elderly/retired populations to participate in focus groups. Focus group participants will be asked about their knowledge of, and initial reactions to, the proposed policy and encouraged to discuss how such a proposal may affect their own alcohol use and alcohol consumption at the population level. Participants will also be asked to discuss potential avenues for increasing acceptability of the policy. The focus groups will adopt a semi-structured, open-ended approach guided by a question schedule. The schedule will be based on feedback from pilot samples, previous research, and a steering group comprising experts in alcohol policy and pricing. RESULTS: The study is expected to take approximately 14 months to complete. CONCLUSIONS: The findings will be of considerable interest and relevance to government officials, policy makers, researchers, advocacy groups, alcohol retail and licensed establishments and organizations, city and town planners, police, and other stakeholder organizations.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

This protocol describes a prospective observational cohort study aimed at (1) characterising the sonographic characteristics of the neonates with critical diseases; and (2) assessing the mortality, significant morbidity, utility of vasoactive medications, fluid resuscitation, duration of ventilation, etc. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a single-centre, prospective and observational study conducted in Chengdu Women's and Children's Central Hospital from 1 December 2022 to 31 December 2027. Neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit will be recruited. After inclusion, the neonates will undergo the neonatal critical care ultrasound. The data collected via case report forms include clinical variables and sonographic measures. The primary outcome is to identify the sonographic characteristics of sick neonates with different diseases, and the secondary outcome is to describe the mortality, significant morbidity, utility of vasoactive medications, fluid resuscitation and duration of ventilation. DISCUSSION: Our study provided an organised neonatal critical care ultrasound workflow, which can be applied in practice. Accordingly, this study will first set up large data on the sonographic description of the neonates with critical illness, which can help to understand the pathophysiology of the critical illness, potentially titrating the treatment.

524,525,rayyan-1277753893,Psychiatr Serv,A clinical trial comparing interviewer and computer-assisted assessment among clients with severe mental illness,"OBJECTIVE: Demographic, behavioral, and diagnostic information should routinely be collected from clients with severe mental illness, and data gathering should employ the most efficient techniques available. Surveys are increasingly conducted via Web-based computer-assisted interviewing (CAI), but this technique is not well validated for patients with severe mental illness. A randomized clinical trial of 245 clients was carried out to compare face-to face and computer-assisted interviewing (233 clients completed two surveys). METHODS: Self-report data were collected on demographic characteristics, substance abuse, risk behaviors for blood-borne diseases, trauma history, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Each client was assessed twice and randomly assigned to one of the four possible combinations of interviewer and computer (computer and computer, N=53; computer and interviewer, N=56; interviewer and computer, N=59; and interviewer and interviewer, N=65). The two formats were compared on feasibility, client preference, cost, reliability, convergent validity, and criterion validity. RESULTS: This study demonstrated the feasibility of CAI across a variety of inpatient and outpatient settings. All participants who began the CAI process completed the interview and responded to over 95% of the survey items. Participants liked using the computers as well as they liked face-to-face interviews, and they completed the CAI as quickly. CAI produced data as reliable and valid as face-to-face interviews produced and was less expensive, and results were available more quickly. The two formats were similar in criterion validity. CONCLUSIONS: CAI appears to be a viable technology for gathering clinical data from the population with severe mental illness and for transforming such information into a useful, quickly accessible form to aid in clinical decision making.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

The authors conducted a positron emission tomography (PET) study to characterize the simultaneous effects of aripiprazole at the D(2), 5-HT(2), and 5-HT(1A) receptors in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. METHOD: Twelve patients who had previously received antipsychotic treatment were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg, or 30 mg of aripiprazole. After at least 14 days of treatment, participants underwent high-resolution PET scans using [(11)C]raclopride, [(18)F]setoperone, and [(11)C]WAY100635. RESULTS: Very high occupancy was observed at striatal D(2) receptors (average putamen, 87%; caudate, 93%; and ventral striatum, 91%), lower occupancy at 5-HT(2) receptors (54%-60%), and even lower occupancy at 5-HT(1A) receptors (16%). D(2) occupancy levels were significantly correlated with plasma drug concentrations, and even the lowest dose (10 mg) led to 85% D(2) occupancy. Extrapyramidal side effects were seen only in two of the four participants with occupancies exceeding 90%. CONCLUSIONS: Aripiprazole exhibits a unique occupancy profile as compared with other conventional and atypical antipsychotics. The threshold for response appears to be higher than 60%, extrapyramidal side effects appear to be uncommon even at occupancies that exceed the conventional extrapyramidal side effects threshold of 80%, and 5-HT(2) occupancy is lower than D(2) occupancy. Implications for aripiprazole's mechanism of action are discussed.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

METHODS: In the context of a clinical trial for SLOS, we performed cross-sectional and repeated-measure observational studies of the relationship between EEG findings and cognitive/behavioral factors on 23 children (aged 4-17 years). EEGs were reviewed for clinical abnormalities, including IEDs, by readers blinded to participants' behavioral symptoms. Between-group differences in baseline characteristics of participants with and without IEDs were analyzed. Within-subject analyses examined the association between the presence of IEDs and changes in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. RESULTS: Of 85 EEGs, 43 (51%) were abnormal, predominantly because of IEDs. Only one subject had documented clinical seizures. IEDs clustered in 13 subjects (57%), whereas 9 subjects (39%) had EEGs consistently free of IEDs. While there were no significant group differences in sex, age, intellectual disability, language level, or baseline ADHD symptoms, autistic symptoms tended to be more prevalent in the ""IED"" group (according to Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2 criteria). Within individuals, the presence of IEDs on a particular EEG predicted, on average, a 27% increase in ADHD symptom severity. CONCLUSIONS: Epileptiform discharges are common in SLOS, despite a relatively low prevalence of epilepsy. Fluctuations in the presence of epileptiform discharges within individual children with a developmental disability syndrome may be associated with fluctuations in ADHD symptomatology, even in the absence of clinical seizures.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

Patients and healthy controls were recruited from two hospitals between July and October 2012. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to test criterion validity. Convergent validity was assessed via correlations between NUCOG and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Reliability was measured by internal consistency (Cronbach's α). Patients with epilepsy (n=144), neurological diseases (n=81), dementia (n=44), and controls (n=260) completed the NUCOG and the MMSE. Overall, both NUCOG and MMSE scores differed significantly across the four groups with the highest scores in the control group and the lowest in the dementia group (p<0.0001). The NUCOG scores could differentiate between patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack. Compared to the MMSE, the NUCOG exhibited a higher area under the ROC curve. The convergent validity was substantially correlated, and internal consistency was very high (0.922). The Chinese version of NUCOG was demonstrated to be a sensitive and reliable screening tool for cognitive impairment in a Chinese-speaking population not only in China, but also in countries where there is a sizeable population of ethnic Chinese. Additionally, our study also showed the NUCOG could better differentiate cognitive function in patients with certain seizure types, stroke and transient ischemic attack than the MMSE. This potentially expands the clinical usefulness of NUCOG, enabling clinicians to measure the cognitive profile of patients with epilepsy and ischemic cerebrovascular diseases.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
531,532,rayyan-1277759861,Eur Child Adolesc Psychiatry,The impact of school-based screening on service use in adolescents at risk for mental health problems and risk-behaviour,"Early detection and intervention can counteract mental disorders and risk behaviours among adolescents. However, help-seeking rates are low. School-based screenings are a promising tool to detect adolescents at risk for mental problems and to improve help-seeking behaviour. We assessed associations between the intervention ""Screening by Professionals"" (ProfScreen) and the use of mental health services and at-risk state at 12 month follow-up compared to a control group. School students (aged 15 ± 0.9 years) from 11 European countries participating in the ""Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe"" (SEYLE) study completed a self-report questionnaire on mental health problems and risk behaviours. ProfScreen students considered ""at-risk"" for mental illness or risk behaviour based on the screening were invited for a clinical interview with a mental health professional and, if necessary, referred for subsequent treatment. At follow-up, students completed another self-report, additionally reporting on service use. Of the total sample (N = 4,172), 61.9% were considered at-risk. 40.7% of the ProfScreen at-risk participants invited for the clinical interview attended the interview, and 10.1% of subsequently referred ProfScreen participants engaged in professional treatment. There were no differences between the ProfScreen and control group regarding follow-up service use and at-risk state. Attending the ProfScreen interview was positively associated with follow-up service use (OR = 1.783, 95% CI = 1.038-3.064), but had no effect on follow-up at-risk state. Service use rates of professional care as well as of the ProfScreen intervention itself were low. Future school-based interventions targeting help-seeking need to address barriers to intervention adherence.Clinical Trials Registration: The trial is registered at the US National Institute of Health (NIH) clinical trial registry (NCT00906620, registered on 21 May, 2009), and the German Clinical Trials Register (DRKS00000214, registered on 27 October, 2009).",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

METHODS: DemTect results were compared to the clinical diagnosis and to FDG-PET as a reference method for the early in vivo detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). RESULTS: 38 patients (age 65.2 +/- 9.8 years, 16 men, 22 women) were investigated using clinical standard examination, FDG-PET, and cranial magnetic resonance imaging. According to NINCDS-ADRDA and Petersen's criteria, 18 patients had dementia of the Alzheimer type (DAT) and 13 patients received the diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Compared to the clinical diagnosis, a DemTect cutoff score of < or =11 points demonstrated good sensitivity (83.3%) and specificity (70.0%) for the detection of DAT, whereas the best cutoff score for MCI was < or =13 points with comparable sensitivity (84.6%) and specificity (85.7%). With regard to FDG-PET, the DemTect demonstrated excellent sensitivity (93%) and low specificity (50%) for the detection of AD-typical patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism (cutoff < or =13 points). CONCLUSION: DemTect is a favorable neuropsychological screening instrument for detecting cognitive dysfunction even in predementia stages of AD. For definite cross-sectional diagnosis, further diagnostic evaluation with higher specificity, e.g. comprehensive neuropsychological examination, FDG-PET or other biomarkers, is necessary.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
533,534,rayyan-1277756056,J Clin Epidemiol,The Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment screen correlated with the Standardized Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section in clinical trials,"OBJECTIVES: The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive section and its standardized version (SADAS-cog) are the current standard for assessing cognitive outcomes in clinical trials of dementia. This study compares a shorter cognitive instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen, with the SADAS-cog as outcome measures in clinical trials. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: The SADAS-cog, Qmci, Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale, and the Lawton-Brady activities of daily living (ADL) scale were assessed at multiple time points, over 1 year in a multicenter randomized clinical trial of 406 patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia. Correlations were estimated using regression at each time point, all time points, and mean values across time. Responsiveness was assessed using the standardized response mean (SRM). RESULTS: Regression for pooled time points showed strong and significant correlation between the SADAS-cog and Qmci (r = -0.75, P < 0.001). Correlations remained strong for mean values across time and at each time point. The SADAS-cog and Qmci also correlated with CDR and ADL scores. There was no difference in SRMs between the SADAS-cog and Qmci [t(357) = -0.32, P = 0.75]. CONCLUSION: The Qmci correlated strongly with the SADAS-cog and both were equally responsive to deterioration. We suggest that clinicians and investigators can substitute the shorter Qmci for the SADAS-cog.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

Aerobic endurance training has been suggested as a potential add-on treatment targeting both physical and mental health. We performed a large-scale multicenter, rater-blind, parallel-group randomized controlled clinical trial in individuals with stable schizophrenia. Participants underwent a professionally supervised six-month training comprising either aerobic endurance training (AET) or flexibility, strengthening, and balance training (FSBT, control group), follow-up was another six months. The primary endpoint was all-cause discontinuation (ACD); secondary endpoints included effects on psychopathology, cognition, functioning, and cardiovascular risk. In total, 180 participants were randomized. AET was not superior to FSBT in ACD and most secondary outcomes, with dropout rates of 59.55% and 57.14% in the six-month active phase, respectively. However, both groups showed significant improvements in positive, general, and total symptoms, levels of functioning and in cognitive performance. A higher training frequency additionally promoted further memory domains. Participants with higher baseline cognitive abilities were more likely to respond to the interventions.

However, it remains unclear whether hybridized exercise-cognitive training facilitates cortical activity and further influences cognitive function after stroke. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to investigate the effects of 2 hybridized exercise-cognitive trainings on neuroplastic changes and behavioral outcomes in stroke survivors with mild cognitive decline. METHODS: This study was a single-blind randomized controlled trial. Stroke survivors were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: (1) sequential exercise-cognitive training (SEQ), (2) dual-task exercise-cognitive training (DUAL), or (3) control group (CON). All groups underwent training 60 min per day, 3 days per week, for a total of 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the resting-state (RS) functional connectivity (FC) in functional magnetic resonance imaging. Secondary behavioral outcomes included cognitive and physical functions. RESULTS: After 12 weeks of training, patients in the SEQ group (n = 21) exhibited increased RS FC between the left occipital lobe and posterior cingulate gyrus with right parietal lobe, compared to the DUAL (n = 22) and CON (n = 20) groups. Additionally, patients in the DUAL group showed increased FC of the left temporal lobe. However, changes in behavioral outcome measures were non-significant among the 3 groups (all P's > .05). CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the distinct neuroplastic mechanisms associated with 2 types of exercise-cognitive hybridized trainings. The pre-post functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements illustrated the time course of neural mechanisms for cognitive recovery in stroke survivors following different exercise-cognitive training approaches.

Major outcome variables were depression measured by the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia, mood measured by the Dementia Mood Assessment Scale and the Alzheimer's Mood Scale, and affect measured by the Observed Affect Scale. Depression was reduced in all three groups with some evidence of superior benefit from exercise. Depression is a common problem with serious and costly consequences for nursing home residents with AD.

Twenty-five patients were randomly assigned to bright white light treatment (2000-3000 lux), and 26 patients were randomized to dim red light placebo control treatment. Unlike those treated with dim red light, those treated with bright white light showed declines in three measures of depression during treatment. Partial relapse appeared within 2 days. A global depression score showed a statistically significant (p = 0.02) difference favoring bright white light treatment. Two bright-light-treated patients became mildly hypomanic, but side effects were mild. Improvement was not correlated with patient expectations; indeed, patients expected somewhat greater benefit from the placebo. Patients treated in summer responded as well as those treated in winter. Baseline electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stage data (e.g., rapid eye movement; REM latency) did not predict treatment responses.

METHODS: Training involved three 1-hour discussions structured around video examples of family/provider communication skills, each followed by practice with standardized patients and self-evaluation. Skills targeted eliciting parent and child concerns, partnering with families, and increasing expectations that treatment would be helpful. We tested the training with providers at 13 sites in rural New York, urban Maryland, and Washington, DC. Children (5-16 years of age) making routine visits were enrolled if they screened ""possible"" or ""probable"" for mental disorders with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire or if their provider said they were likely to have an emotional or behavioral problem. Children and their parents were then monitored for 6 months, to assess changes in parent-rated symptoms and impairment and parent symptoms. RESULTS: Fifty-eight providers (31 trained and 27 control) and 418 children (248 patients of trained providers and 170 patients of control providers) participated. Among the children, 72% were in the possible or probable categories. Approximately one half (54%) were white, 30% black, 12% Latino, and 4% other ethnicities. Eighty-eight percent (367 children) completed follow-up monitoring. At 6 months, minority children cared for by trained providers had greater reduction in impairment (-0.91 points) than did those cared for by control providers but no greater reduction in symptoms. Seeing a trained provider did not have an impact on symptoms or impairment among white children. Parents of children cared for by trained providers experienced greater reduction in symptoms (-1.7 points) than did those cared for by control providers.

DESIGN: Proof-of-concept, parallel group RCT design. SETTING: Regional burn center. PARTICIPANTS: Acutely injured, hospitalized adult survivors of burn injury (N=50) were randomly assigned to SMART (n=28) or nondirective supportive psychotherapy (n=22). Due to dropout and missing data, final sample size was 40, SMART (n=21) and nondirective supportive psychotherapy (n=19). INTERVENTIONS: SMART is a manualized, 4-session cognitive behavioral therapy-based psychological intervention targeting ASD, PTSD, and MDD symptoms. NDSP is a manualized, 4-session protocol. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Davidson Trauma Scale ([DTS]; diagnostic proxy for ASD and PTSD; clinical cutoff=40, with higher score=higher severity) and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 ([PHQ-9]; diagnostic proxy for MDD; clinical cutoff=10, with higher score=higher severity) at pretreatment, immediate posttreatment, and 1 month posttreatment. RESULTS: At baseline, median DTS scores and PHQ-9 scores were above clinical cutoffs and did not differ across groups. At 1 week and 1 month posttreatment, median DTS and PHQ-9 scores were beneath clinical cutoffs in the SMART group; scores remained above clinical cutoffs in the NDSP group at these time points. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to conduct an RCT of SMART in hospitalized adult survivors of burn injury. SMART has the potential to yield clinically significant outcomes.

Useful data were available for the other 10 children. Of the long-term survivors 74 had received routine, and 84 had received intensive nursery care. At eight years of age there were no statistically significant differences in the frequencies of a variety of individual abnormalities; fewer of the intensively managed children had cerebral palsy, but sensorineural deafness and ocular abnormalities occurred more frequently. Individual children were graded into four carefully defined groups: (a) profound handicap (4.4 per cent of entire study group); (b) severe handicap (10.1 per cent); (c) significant handicap (37.3 per cent); and (d) trivial or no handicap (41.8 per cent). Inadequate data were available for 6.3 per cent of the children. It was apparent that the improved survival attributed to intensive neonatal care was achieved at the expense of additional severely handicapped children, and this feature is discussed.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
779,246,rayyan-1277758179,Seizure,Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) improves sexual functioning and intimacy among older women with epilepsy: A multicenter randomized controlled trial,"PURPOSE: Women with epilepsy (WWE) frequently experience sexual problems, including sexual dysfunction and sexual distress. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the efficacy of a mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for sexuality (MBCT-S) on sexual function and intimacy among older adult WWE in Iran. METHODS: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted at 15 neurology clinics in three Iranian cities. WWE together with their partners and healthcare providers were randomly assigned in patient and partner (PP; n = 220), patient, partner, and healthcare provider (PPHP; n = 220), or treatment as usual (TAU; n = 220) group. WWE and their partners in both the PP and PPHP groups received eight weeks of MBCT-S sessions. In the PPHP group, three individual sessions on sexual counseling were added for healthcare providers. Self-assessment scales were used at baseline, one month and six months after completing the intervention. Mixed linear regression models were developed to determine differences among the three groups. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted to understand the mediating effects of mindfulness, intimacy, patient-physicians relationship and sexual counseling barriers. RESULTS: Improvements in sexual function, sexual distress, and intimacy were found in both the PP and PPHP groups at one-month and six-month follow-ups. The PPHP group compared with the PP group had greater improvement in intimacy at both follow-ups. Regarding sexual function, the PPHP group performed better than the PP group at the six-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The MBCT-S appears efficacious in enhancing sexual function and reducing sex-related distress in Iranian older adult WWE. Future studies should examine its efficacy in other populations.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

METHOD: Inpatients with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed, treatment-resistant bipolar depression, who were acutely admitted to 1 of the 7 clinical study centers in Norway, were recruited from May 2008 to April 2011 into a prospective, randomized controlled, 6-week acute treatment trial. General neurocognitive function was assessed with the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB), and retrograde memory for autobiographical events was assessed with the Autobiographical Memory Interview-Short Form (AMI-SF) before and shortly after (mean = 23.5 days) a trial with either RUL brief-pulse ECT (mean dose = 233.3 mC) or APT. RESULTS: Seventy-three patients entered, and 39 (nECT = 19, nAPT = 20) completed. Both groups showed improvements in all MCCB domain scores, with no significant differences between the study groups (no interaction effect: F₁,₃₇ = 1.52, P = NS). Improvements in neurocognitive performance were significantly correlated with reductions in depression ratings posttreatment. The AMI-SF score was significantly lower (based on consistent answers from pre- to posttreatment) in the ECT group (72.9%) than in the APT group (80.8%, P = .025), indicating reduced consistency in autobiographical memory after ECT. CONCLUSIONS: General neurocognitive function was unaffected by RUL brief-pulse ECT treatment and positively related to improved mood in bipolar depression. Autobiographical memory consistency was reduced in patients treated with ECT. The results suggest that ECT can be used in treatment-resistant bipolar depression without compromising general neurocognitive function. The clinical relevance of reduced autobiographical memory consistency in the ECT group requires further investigation.

784,251,rayyan-1277755770,J Head Trauma Rehabil,Comparison of cognitive behavioral therapy and supportive psychotherapy for the treatment of depression following traumatic brain injury: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the efficacy of 2 different interventions (cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] and supportive psychotherapy [SPT]) to treat post-traumatic brain injury (TBI) depression. PARTICIPANTS: A sample of 77 community-dwelling individuals with a TBI, and a diagnosis of depression. Participants were randomized into treatment conditions either CBT or SPT and received up to 16 sessions of individual psychotherapy. MEASURES: Participants completed the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV and self-report measures of depression (Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), perceived social support (Interpersonal Support Evaluation List), stressful life events (Life Experiences Survey), and quality of life (QOL) before beginning and immediately following treatment. RESULTS: No significant differences were found at baseline between CBT and SPT groups on demographic factors (sex, age, education, race, and time since injury) or baseline measures of depression, anxiety, participation, perceived social support, stressful life events, or QOL. Analyses of variance revealed significant time effects for the Beck Depression Inventory-Second Edition, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and QOL outcome measures but no group effects. Intention-to-treat mixed effects analyses did not find any significant difference in patterns of scores of the outcome measures between the CBT and SPT intervention groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both forms of psychotherapy were efficacious in improving diagnoses of depression and anxiety and reducing depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that in this sample of individuals with TBI, CBT was not more effective in treating depression than SPT, though further research is needed with larger sample sizes to identify different components of these interventions that may be effective with different TBI populations.

787,254,rayyan-1277752776,Am J Psychiatry,"A randomized, controlled trial of cognitive behavioral social skills training for middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia","OBJECTIVE: The number of older patients with chronic schizophrenia is increasing. There is a need for empirically validated psychotherapy interventions for these patients. Cognitive behavioral social skills training teaches cognitive and behavioral coping techniques, social functioning skills, problem solving, and compensatory aids for neurocognitive impairments. The authors compared treatment as usual with the combination of treatment as usual plus cognitive behavioral social skills training. METHOD: The randomized, controlled trial included 76 middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia, who were assigned to either treatment as usual or combined treatment. Cognitive behavioral social skills training was administered over 24 weekly group sessions. Blind raters assessed social functioning, psychotic and depressive symptoms, cognitive insight, and skill mastery. RESULTS: After treatment, the patients receiving combined treatment performed social functioning activities significantly more frequently than the patients in treatment as usual, although general skill at social functioning activities did not differ significantly. Patients receiving cognitive behavioral social skills training achieved significantly greater cognitive insight, indicating more objectivity in reappraising psychotic symptoms, and demonstrated greater skill mastery. The overall group effect was not significant for symptoms, but the greater increase in cognitive insight with combined treatment was significantly correlated with greater reduction in positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: With cognitive behavioral social skills training, middle-aged and older outpatients with chronic schizophrenia learned coping skills, evaluated anomalous experiences with more objectivity (achieved greater cognitive insight), and improved social functioning. Additional research is needed to determine whether cognitive insight mediates psychotic symptom change in cognitive behavior therapy for psychosis.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
788,255,rayyan-1277755864,Brain Stimul,"A double-blind, randomized trial of deep repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for autism spectrum disorder","BACKGROUND: Biomedical treatment options for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are extremely limited. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe and efficacious technique when targeting specific areas of cortical dysfunction in major depressive disorder, and a similar approach could yield therapeutic benefits in ASD, if applied to relevant cortical regions. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine whether deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex improves social relating in ASD. METHODS: 28 adults diagnosed with either autistic disorder (high-functioning) or Asperger's disorder completed a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design with 2 weeks of daily weekday treatment. This involved deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (5 Hz, 10-s train duration, 20-s inter-train interval) for 15 min (1500 pulses per session) using a HAUT-Coil. The sham rTMS coil was encased in the same helmet of the active deep rTMS coil, but no effective field was delivered into the brain. Assessments were conducted before, after, and one month following treatment. RESULTS: Participants in the active condition showed a near significant reduction in self-reported social relating symptoms from pre-treatment to one month follow-up, and a significant reduction in social relating symptoms (relative to sham participants) for both post-treatment assessments. Those in the active condition also showed a reduction in self-oriented anxiety during difficult and emotional social situations from pre-treatment to one month follow-up. There were no changes for those in the sham condition. CONCLUSION: Deep rTMS to bilateral dorsomedial prefrontal cortex yielded a reduction in social relating impairment and socially-related anxiety. Further research in this area should employ extended rTMS protocols that approximate those used in depression in an attempt to replicate and amplify the clinical response.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Cognitive intervention has been shown to be beneficial in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few community-based cognitive intervention programs are available in Hong Kong. The aim of this project is to examine and compare the feasibility, acceptability, and clinical outcome of a cognitive intervention program for older patients with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia using telemedicine versus a conventional face-to-face method. METHODS: Community-dwelling older subjects with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairments were recruited from a community center. A total of 12 sessions of assessment and cognitive intervention were conducted via videoconferencing or by face-to-face method. Assessment included: Cantonese version of Mini Mental State Examination (C-MMSE), Cantonese version of Rivermead Behavioural Memory test (C-RBMT) and Hierarchic Dementia Scale (HDS). RESULTS: Twenty-two clients were recruited. There was significant and comparable cognitive improvement in clients in both treatment arms. The videoconference arm was highly accepted by the clients and the community center. Overall compliance rate of participants was above 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine was a feasible, effective and acceptable means in providing cognitive assessment and intervention to older persons with mild cognitive deficits. Promoting such a program to other community settings would further enhance the accessibility of dementia service to the community.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

The present study tested a GAD treatment that targeted intolerance of uncertainty, erroneous beliefs about worry, poor problem orientation, and cognitive avoidance. Twenty-six primary GAD patients were randomly allocated to a treatment condition (n = 14) or a delayed treatment control condition (n = 12). Self-report, clinician, and significant other ratings assessed GAD and associated symptoms. The results show that the treatment led to statistically and clinically significant change at posttest and that gains were maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. Furthermore, 20 of 26 participants (77%) no longer met GAD diagnostic criteria following treatment. With regard to the treatment's underlying model, the results show that intolerance of uncertainty significantly decreased over treatment and that gains were maintained at both follow-ups. Although nonspecific factors were not significant predictors of treatment outcome, their role in the treatment of GAD requires further investigation.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

797,264,rayyan-1277750770,Am J Psychiatry,Predicting feasibility of day treatment for unselected patients referred for inpatient psychiatric treatment: results of a randomized trial,"OBJECTIVE: Because previous studies of day treatment as an alternative to inpatient treatment had major disadvantages or methodological shortcomings, the authors conducted a randomized controlled trial to estimate and predict the extent to which day treatment is feasible for unselected patients referred for inpatient treatment. METHOD: Of 160 patients, 57 were randomly assigned to the control condition and 103 were assigned to the experimental condition. Control patients received standard clinical care. In the experimental condition, day treatment was attempted as soon as the patient's condition permitted. The average number of nights per week that experimental patients spent away from the hospital was compared to the average number of nights away for patients under standard care. RESULTS: Day treatment was satisfactory for 40% of the experimental patients but was completely infeasible for another 40%. The level of surveillance needed in the first week, physical illness, number of previous admissions, depressive symptoms, and treatment by qualified psychiatrists versus registrars were variables predictive of these differences. CONCLUSIONS: In this unselected group of patients, no absolute contraindications against day treatment were found. This suggests that the selection criteria applied in nearly all other controlled studies on the subject were unwarranted. The approach used in this study facilitated treatment in the least restrictive environment possible.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

METHODS: Forty children with ADHD were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions. Parents of 20 children with ADHD were instructed and thoroughly supervised in improving their children's sleep schedules and sleep behaviour. Parents of the other 20 children with ADHD and parents of 20 healthy children received general information about sleep hygiene. At baseline and 12 weeks later, parents and children completed questionnaires related to children's sleep and psychological functioning. RESULTS: Relative to the control groups, children in the intervention group improved sleep quantitatively and qualitatively (F values < 3.33, P values < 0.05). The intervention group children reported improvements in mood, emotions, and relationships (F values < 2.99, P values < 0.05). Parents reported that their children improved in physical and psychological wellbeing, mood, emotions, relationships, and social acceptance (F values < 3.02, P values < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Training and monitoring parents of children with ADHD in regulating and supervising children's sleep schedules leads to positive changes in the emotions, behaviour and social lives of these children.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Pharmacotherapy is the standard of care in epilepsy; however, few interventions exist to promote cognitive development and to mitigate disease burden. We aimed to examine the impact of two different modalities of neurofeedback (NFB) on cognitive functioning and quality-of-life (QOL) measurements in children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy. The study also explored the effects of NFB on clinical outcomes and electroencephalography (EEG) quantitative analysis. METHODS: Participants (n = 44) with controlled focal epilepsy were randomized to one of three arms: sensorimotor rhythm (SMR) NFB (n = 15), slow cortical potentials (SCP) NFB (n = 16), or sham NFB (n = 13). All participants received 25 sessions of intervention. The attention switching task (AST), Liverpool Seizure Severity Scale (LSSS), seizure frequency (SF), EEG power spectrum, and coherence were measured at baseline, postintervention, and at 3-month follow-up. RESULTS: In children and adolescents with controlled focal epilepsy, SMR training significantly reduced reaction time in the AST (p = 0.006), and this was correlated with the difference of change for theta power on EEG (p = 0.03); only the SMR group showed a significant decrease in beta coherence (p = 0.03). All groups exhibited improvement in QOL (p = <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first data on two NFB modalities (SMR and SCP) including cognitive, neurophysiological, and clinical outcomes in pediatric epilepsy. Sensorimotor rhythm NFB improved cognitive functioning, while all the interventions showed improvements in QOL, demonstrating a powerful placebo effect in the sham group.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Moreover, the comparative effects of different intervention durations remain to be established and, besides cognitive effects, pragmatic parameters, such as cost-effectiveness and experiential relevance to participants, are seldom explored. In this work, we present a randomized controlled wait-list trial evaluating 2 different intervention durations (standard = 17 vs brief = 11 sessions) of a cognitive stimulation program developed for older adults with cognitive impairments with or without dementia. 20 participants were randomly assigned to the standard duration intervention program (17 sessions, 1.5 months) or to a wait-list group. At postintervention of the standard intervention group, the wait-list group crossed over to receive the brief intervention program (11 sessions, 1 month). Changes in neuropsychological, functionality, quality of life, and caregiver outcomes were evaluated. Experience during intervention and costs and feasibility were also evaluated. The current cognitive stimulation programs (ie, standard and brief) showed high values of experiential relevance for both intervention durations. High adherence, completion rates, and reasonable costs were found for both formats. Further studies are needed to definitively establish the potential efficacy, optimal duration, cost-effectiveness, and experiential relevance for participants of cognitive intervention approaches.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0
806,273,rayyan-1277752884,Alcohol Clin Exp Res,The effectiveness of anxiety treatment on alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid phobic disorder: a randomized controlled trial,"OBJECTIVE: Evidence has emerged which indicates that the post-treatment relapse rate for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder is higher than for alcohol-dependent patients without a comorbid anxiety disorder. The question raised by this evidence is whether the relapse rate in these dually diagnosed patients could be reduced if they were given additional treatment for the comorbid anxiety disorder. We attempted to answer this question by conducting a trial among patients with a double diagnosis of alcohol dependence and agoraphobia or social phobia. METHOD: We conducted a 32-week randomized controlled trial among 96 abstinent patients with a primary diagnosis of alcohol dependence and a comorbid anxiety disorder involving agoraphobia or social phobia. The patients were randomly assigned to an intensive psychosocial relapse-prevention program on its own (n = 49) or in combination with an anxiety treatment program comprising cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and optional pharmacotherapy consisting of an SSRI (n = 47). The primary outcome measure was the percentage of patients who suffered an alcohol relapse during a 32-week period. The secondary outcome measures were total abstinence, a reduction in the days of heavy drinking, and less severe anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: Although the additional therapy clearly reduced the anxiety symptoms, it had no significant effect on the alcohol relapse rates. CONCLUSION: Anxiety treatment for alcohol-dependent patients with a comorbid anxiety disorder can alleviate anxiety symptoms, but it has no significant effect on the outcome of alcohol treatment programs.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

Freeze lesions resulted in interictal discharges and occasional ictal-like events. The interictal discharges were dependent upon activation of non-NMDA excitatory amino acid receptors and were affected by but did not require NMDA receptor activation. Voltage clamp and current clamp recordings revealed abnormal bursts of low-amplitude action potentials in 36% of recorded neurons, while large, repetitive inhibitory potentials, mediated by GABAA receptors, were recorded in 90% of the neurons. Thus, prominent findings in this model include abnormalities of both excitatory and inhibitory activity. Since these changes in neuronal excitability resulted from a localized physical injury, they may resemble the changes that occur in acute posttraumatic epilepsy.",In-vitro-study,8,0

However, the role of signaling cascades in this process has not been precisely elucidated. This study was performed to determine the role of signaling cascades involving reactive oxygen species (ROS)/RhoA/PI3K/PKB in increasing the permeability of the BTB induced by NS1619. Using an in vitro BTB model and selective inhibitors of signaling pathways, we investigated whether ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB pathway plays a key role in the process of the increase in BTB permeability induced by NS1619. The results revealed that the BTB permeability was increased and the expression of TJ proteins were significantly decreased by NS1619, and selective inhibitors of identified signaling pathways reversed the observed alterations. Moreover, the significant increases in ROS, RhoA activity, and PKB phosphorylation after NS1619 administration were observed, which were partly inhibited by N-2-mercaptopropionyl glycine or C3 exoenzyme or LY294002 pretreatment. The present study demonstrates that the activation of signaling cascades involving ROS/RhoA/PI3K/PKB in rat brain microvascular endothelial cells was required for the increase in BTB permeability induced by NS1619.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In this article, we show that the fluorescence lifetime of synthetic dyes covalently attached to amyloid proteins informs on the structural properties of amyloid clusters formed both in vitro and in cells. We demonstrate that the mechanism behind such a ""lifetime sensor"" of protein aggregation is based on fluorescence self-quenching and that it offers a good dynamic range to report on various stages of aggregation without significantly perturbing the process under investigation. We show that the sensor informs on the structural density of amyloid clusters in a high-throughput and quantitative manner and in these aspects the sensor outperforms super-resolution imaging techniques. We demonstrate the power and speed of the method, offering capabilities, for example, in therapeutic screenings that monitor biological self-assembly. We investigate the mechanism and advantages of the lifetime sensor in studies of the K18 protein fragment of the Alzheimer's disease related protein tau and its amyloid aggregates formed in vitro.

Organoid structures were absent as were signs of differentiation into more mature neuroglial cells since a relatively uniform immature cell population was typical for the nodules studied. Nuclear changes in form of nuclear envelope dilatation, margination and condensation of chromatin were present. The S-100 protein was generally expressed by the neuroglial cells in this premalignant phase; GFA and 14.3.2. protein were expressed to a variable degree. The cells showed enhanced proliferation.

Therapeutic progress is also limited by cellular heterogeneity within and between tumors, among other factors such as therapy resistance. To address these challenges, we present an experimental model using human cerebral organoids as a scaffold for patient-derived GBM cell invasion. METHODS: This study combined tissue clearing and confocal microscopy with single-cell RNA sequencing of GBM cells before and after co-culture with organoid cells. RESULTS: We show that tumor cells within organoids extend a network of long microtubes, recapitulating the in vivo behavior of GBM. Transcriptional changes implicated in the invasion process are coherent across patient samples, indicating that GBM cells reactively upregulate genes required for their dispersion. Potential interactions between GBM and organoid cells identified by an in silico receptor-ligand pairing screen suggest functional therapeutic targets. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our model has proven useful for studying GBM invasion and transcriptional heterogeneity in vitro, with applications for both pharmacological screens and patient-specific treatment selection on a time scale amenable to clinical practice.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1333,800,rayyan-1270413906,PLoS One,Contact and encirclement of glioma cells in vitro is an intrinsic behavior of a clonal human neural stem cell line,"Pathotropic neural stem and/or progenitor cells (NSCs) can potentially deliver therapeutic agents to otherwise inaccessible cancers. In glioma, NSCs are found in close contact with tumor cells, raising the possibility that specificity of NSC contact with glioma targets originates in the tumor cells themselves. Alternatively, target preferences may originate, at least in part, in the tumor microenvironment. To better understand mechanisms underlying NSC interactions with glioma cells, we examined NSC-target cell contacts in a highly simplified 3-dimensional peptide hydrogel (Puramatrix) in which cell behaviors can be studied in the relative absence of external cues. HB1.F3 is an immortalized clonal human NSC line extensively characterized in preclinical investigations. To study contact formation between HB1.F3 NSCs and glioma cells, we first examined co-cultures of eGFP-expressing HB1.F3 (HB1.F3.eGFP) NSCs and dsRed-expressing U251 glioma (U251.dsRed) cells. Using confocal microscopy, HB1.F3.eGFP cells were observed contacting or encircling U251.dsRed glioma cells, but never the reverse. Next, examining specificity of these contacts, no significant quantitative differences in either percentages of HB1.F3 NSCs contacting targets, or in the extent of target cell encirclement, were observed when HB1.F3.eGFP cells were presented with various potential target cells (human glioma and breast cancer cell lines, patient-derived brain tumor lines, non-tumor fibroblasts, primary mouse and human astroglial cells, and primary adult and newborn human dermal fibroblasts) except that interactions between HB1.F3 cells did not progress beyond establishing contacts. Finally cytoskeletal mechanisms employed by HB1.F3.eGFP cells varied with the substrate. When migrating in Puramatrix, HB1.F3 NSCs exhibited intermittent process extension followed by soma translocation, while during encirclement their movements were more amoeboid. We conclude that formation of contacts and subsequent encirclement of target cells by HB1.F3 NSCs is an intrinsic property of these NSCs, and that preferential contact formation with tumor cells in vivo must therefore be highly dependent on microenvironmental cues.",In-vitro-study,8,0

MiR-146a has been reported to be highly related to cell invasion, metastasis, immunity, inflammation and apoptosis. Previous studies have indicated that miR-146a can either inhibit or promote apoptosis through different pathophysiological processes. In our previous study, miR-146a in the blood was down-regulated during acute ischemic stroke. However, the connection between miR-146a and acute cerebral ischemic injury and the mechanism underlying the connection remain unclear. Here, we aimed to investigate the role of miR-146a and its possible target genes in human SK-N-SH cells subjected to 16h of oxygen-glucose deprivation and 12h of reperfusion (OGD/R) injury. Cells were transfected with miR-146a mimic or inhibitor to alter the expression of miR-146a. MiR-146a in the SK-N-SH cells was down-regulated after OGD/R injury. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis and dual luciferase assays demonstrated that miR-146a directly recognized the 3'-UTR of the pro-apoptotic genes, Caspase7 and Bcl-2-associated transcription factor 1 (Bclaf1). Furthermore, miR-146a over-expression effectively decreased the mRNA and protein expression of Caspase7 and Bclaf1, and aggravated OGD/R-induced cell apoptosis; in contrast, miR-146a down-regulation was neuroprotective. In conclusion, our study revealed that miR-146a contributes to OGD/R injury in vitro, while negatively regulating the pro-apoptotic genes, Caspase7 and Bclaf1. This special mechanism provides new insight into miRNA regulatory networks. In addition, miR-146a may offer a potential therapeutic approach to cerebral ischemic injury.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Evidence suggests that cytoplasmic mislocalization of nuclear proteins such as transactive response DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) and fused in sarcoma (FUS) may be associated with neurotoxicity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration. This study investigated the changes in nucleocytoplasmic distributions of the proteome and transcriptome in an in vitro model of ALS. After subcellular fractionation of motor neuron-like cell lines expressing wild-type or G93A mutant hSOD1, quantitative mass spectrometry and next-generation RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) were performed for the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments. A subset of the results was validated via immunoblotting. A total of 1,925 proteins were identified in either the nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions, and 32% of these proteins were quantified in both fractions. The nucleocytoplasmic distribution of 37 proteins was significantly changed in mutant cells with nuclear and cytoplasmic shifts in 13 and 24 proteins, respectively (p<0.05). The proteins shifted towards the nucleus were enriched regarding pathways of RNA transport and processing (Dhx9, Fmr1, Srsf3, Srsf6, Tra2b), whereas protein folding (Cct5, Cct7, Cct8), aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis (Farsb, Nars, Txnrd1), synaptic vesicle cycle (Cltc, Nsf), Wnt signalling (Cltc, Plcb3, Plec, Psmd3, Ruvbl1) and Hippo signalling (Camk2d, Plcb3, Ruvbl1) pathways were over-represented in the proteins shifted to the cytoplasm. A weak correlation between the changes in protein and mRNA levels was found only in the nucleus, where mRNA was relatively abundant in mutant cells. This study provides a comprehensive dataset of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the proteome and transcriptome in an in vitro model of ALS. An integrated analysis of the nucleocytoplasmic distribution of the proteome and transcriptome demonstrated multiple candidate pathways including RNA processing/transport and protein synthesis and folding that may be relevant to the pathomechanism of ALS.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1337,804,rayyan-1270414143,Hum Mol Genet,Dilysine motifs in exon 2b of SMN protein mediate binding to the COPI vesicle protein α-COP and neurite outgrowth in a cell culture model of spinal muscular atrophy,"Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a devastating neuromuscular disorder that stems from low levels of survival of motor neuron (SMN) protein. The processes that cause motor neurons and muscle cells to become dysfunctional are incompletely understood. We are interested in neuromuscular homeostasis and the stresses put upon that system by loss of SMN. We recently reported that α-COP, a member of the coatomer complex of coat protein I (COPI) vesicles, is an SMN-binding partner, implicating this protein complex in normal SMN function. To investigate the functional significance of the interaction between α-COP and SMN, we constructed an inducible NSC-34 cell culture system to model the consequences of SMN depletion and find that depletion of SMN protein results in shortened neurites. Heterologous expression of human SMN, and interestingly over-expression of α-COP, restores normal neurite length and morphology. Mutagenesis of the canonical COPI dilysine motifs in exon 2b results in failure to bind to α-COP and abrogates the ability of human SMN to restore neurite outgrowth in SMN-depleted motor neuron-like NSC-34 cells. We conclude that the interaction between SMN and α-COP serves an important function in the growth and maintenance of motor neuron processes and may play a significant role in the pathogenesis of SMA.",In-vitro-study,8,0

However, tPA could induce the intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), which is the main cause of death in ischemic stroke patient after tPA treatment. At present, there is no treatment strategy to ameliorate tPA-induced brain injury after ischemia. Therefore, we investigated the effect of pre-treated isoflurane, which is a volatile anesthetic and has beneficial effects on neurological dysfunction, brain edema and infarct volume in ischemic stroke model. In this study, we used oxygen/glucose deprivation and reperfusion (OGD/R) condition to mimic an ischemic stroke in vitro. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) activity was measured in endothelial cell media. Also, neuronal cell culture was performed to investigate the effect of pretreated isoflurane on the neuronal cell survival after tPA-induced injury during OGD/R. Isoflurane pretreatment prevented tPA-induced MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity and suppressed tPA-triggered LRP/NF-κB/Cox-2 signaling after OGD/R. Neuronal cells, incubated with endothelial cell conditioned medium (EC-CM) after tPA + OGD/R, showed upregulation of pro-apoptotic molecules. However, neurons incubated with isoflurane-pretreated EC-CM showed increased anti-apoptotic molecules. Our findings suggest that isoflurane pretreatment could attenuate tPA-exaggerated brain ischemic injury, by reducing tPA-induced LRP/NF-κB/Cox-2 in endothelial cells, endothelial MMP-2 and MMP-9 activation, and subsequent pro-apoptotic molecule in neurons after OGD/R.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Due to its high sensitivity and specificity, MS is now being explored for biomarker quantitative validation in tissue and biofluids. In this study, we demonstrate the use of MS in both qualitative protein identification and targeted detection of acute TBI biomarkers released from degenerating cultured rat cortical mixed neuronal cells, mimicking intracellular fluid in the central nervous system after TBI. Calpain activation was induced by cell treatment with maitotoxin (MTX), a known calcium channel opener. Separate plates of mixed neuronal-glial culture were subjected to excitotoxin N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and apoptotic inducer staurosporine. Acute TBI biomarkers, GFAP and UCH-L1, were first detected and assessed in the culture media by Western blot. The cell-conditioned media were then trypsinized and subjected to bottom up proteomic analysis. GFAP was readily detected by data-dependent scanning but not UCH-L1. As a proof-of-principle study, rat glia-enriched cell cultures treated with MTX were used to investigate the time-dependent release of GFAP breakdown product by Western blot and for isotope dilution MS absolute quantitation method development. Absolute quantitation of the GFAP release was conducted using the three cortical mixed neuronal cell cultures treated with different agents. Other differentially expressed proteins identified in the glial-enriched and cortical mixed neuronal cell culture models were further analyzed by bioinformatic tools. In summary, this study demonstrates the use of MS in both protein identification and targeted quantitation of acute TBI biomarkers and is the preliminary step toward development of TBI biomarker validation by targeted MS.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Magnesium sulfate has been clinically used as a cyto-protective agent against HI brain injury in newborns in some countries, including Japan. However, it is not clear how magnesium exerts this effect and how it acts on the individual types of cells within the newborn brain. In this study, we exposed cultured rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells to magnesium sulfate during the period when they differentiate into oligodendrocytes, and showed that magnesium-exposed oligodendrocytes exhibited more resistance to HI injury.

Ether à go-go-1 (Eag1) potassium channel and epidermal growth factor receptors (ErbB1 and ErbB2) have been associated to invasive phenotypes or poor prognosis in cancer patients. However, cells arrange their cytoskeleton in order to acquire a successful migration pattern. We have studied ErbBs and Eag1 expression, and cytoskeleton arrangements in 11 human pituitary adenomas. Eag1, ErbB1 and ErbB2 expression were studied by immunochemistry in tissue and cultured cells. The cytoskeleton arrangement was analyzed in cultured cells by immunofluorescence. Normal pituitary tissue showed ErbB2 expression and Eag1 only in few cells. However, Eag1 and ErbB2 were expressed in all the tumors analyzed. ErbB1 expression was observed variable and did not show specificity for a tumor characteristic. Cultured cells from micro- and macro-adenomas clinically functional organize their cytoskeleton suggesting a mesenchymal pattern, and a round leucocyte/amoeboid pattern from invasive clinically silent adenoma. Pituitary tumors over-express EGF receptors and the ErbB2 repeated expression suggests is a characteristic of adenomas. Eag 1 was express, in different extent, and could be a therapeutic target. The cytoskeleton arrangements observed suggest that pituitary tumor cells acquire different patterns: mesenchymal, and leucocyte/amoeboid, the last observed in the invasive adenomas. Amoeboid migration pattern has been associated with high invasion capacity.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1346,813,rayyan-1270410514,Neurosurgery,Accelerated nonmuscle contraction after subarachnoid hemorrhage: culture and characterization of myofibroblasts from human cerebral arteries in vasospasm,"Cell culture lines from human cerebral arteries showing vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage were established from three autopsy cases. Each culture line showed the ultrastructural characteristics of myofibroblasts. Decreased alpha-actin antigenicity, demonstrated using the anti-smooth muscle cell alpha-actin antibody, was observed in cultured cells possessing abundant F-actin. When incorporated into the three-dimensional collagen matrix in vitro, the cultured cells compacted the collagen lattice at a rate equivalent to that of human dermal fibroblasts. Lattice compaction was significantly accelerated by cerebrospinal fluid taken from patients with symptomatic vasospasm. Compaction was completely inhibited by the addition of 10(-6) mol/L verapamil or 100 U/mL heparin. Neither nimodipine (10(-5) mol/L) nor nicardipine (10(-5) mol/L) inhibited compaction, and endothelin (10(-6) mol/L) and potassium chloride (40 mmol/L) had no effect. The morphological change of cells in the collagen lattice suggests that both verapamil and heparin affect cellular motility, filopodial protrusion, and cell attachment. These data suggest that myofibroblasts in human cerebral arteries differ from medial smooth muscle cells and can generate a force rearranging the proliferated collagen matrix present after subarachnoid hemorrhage. This reorganization can contribute to, or be responsible for, sustained vasoconstriction. Consequently, current treatment for vasospasm may need to be reevaluated to include the nonmuscle components in the vessel wall.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The search for candidate treatments would be greatly facilitated by the availability of human cell-based models of prion disease. Recently, an induced pluripotent stem cell derived human cerebral organoid model was shown to take up and propagate human CJD prions. This model offers new opportunities to screen drug candidates for the treatment of human prion diseases in an entirely human genetic background. Here we provide the first evidence that human cerebral organoids can be a viable model for CJD drug screening by using an established anti-prion compound, pentosan polysulfate (PPS). PPS delayed prion propagation in a prophylactic-like treatment paradigm and also alleviated propagation when applied following establishment of infection in a therapeutic-like treatment paradigm. This study demonstrates the utility of cerebral organoids as the first human 3D cell culture system for screening therapeutic drug candidates for human prion diseases.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Ex Schult inhibits CNS enzymes and delays glutamate excitotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells via oxidative damage,"One of the most promising approaches to confront the complexity of central nervous system disorders are new multi-target directed ligands (MTDLs). Five medicinal species (Cereus grandiflorus (L.) Mill., Hyssopus officinalis L., Acorus calamus L., Silybum marianum L. Gaertn. and Turnera diffusa Willd. Ex Schult), selected for their ethnopharmacological relevance, were object for in vitro screening. The aqueous extract of T. diffusa revealed the strongest neuroactive potential, inhibiting monoamine oxidase-A (IC(50) = 129.80 ± 11.97 μg/mL), and acetyl- and butyrylcholinesterase (IC(25) = 0.352 ± 0.011 and 0.370 ± 0.036 mg/mL, respectively). Its phenolic profile was established for the first time by HPLC-DAD-ESI/MS(n). Twenty-six out of thirty-seven compounds were newly identified in this species. The pre-treatment with this flavonoid-rich extract promoted a rightward shift of the glutamate concentration neuronal cell (SH-SY5Y) death response curve. Furthermore, it significantly reduced the early phase formation of intracellular reactive species after glutamate and t-BHP exposure, suggesting that neuroprotection in SH-SY5Y cells was, in part, mediated by antioxidant mechanisms.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The abundance and subcellular distribution of UBE3A has been the topic of many previous studies as its dosage and localization has been linked to neurodevelopmental disorders including Autism, Dup15q syndrome, and Angelman syndrome. While commercially available antibodies have been widely employed to determine UBE3A localization, an extensive analysis and comparison of the performance of different UBE3A antibodies has not been conducted. Here we evaluated the specificities of seven commercial UBE3A antibodies in two of the major experimental models used in UBE3A research, mouse and human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural cells and tissues. We tested these antibodies in their two most common assays, immunofluorescence and western blot. In addition, we also assessed the ability of these antibodies to capture dynamic spatiotemporal changes of UBE3A by utilizing human cerebral organoid models. Our results reveal that among the seven antibodies tested, three antibodies demonstrated substantial nonspecific immunoreactivity. While four antibodies show specific localization patterns in both mouse brain sections and human cerebral organoids, these antibodies varied significantly in background signals and staining patterns in undifferentiated human pluripotent stem cells.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The lytic destruction of oligodendrocytes, which occurs at the terminal stage of the viral infection cycle, is considered a critical factor in the development of demyelination and the pathogenesis of PML. However, knowledge is limited about interaction of JCV with oligodendrocytes and its impact on the denudation of axons at the early stage of viral reactivation and prior to the destruction of the infected cells. We have developed an in vitro neuroprogenitor cell culture using human fetal brain that can be differentiated to the oligodendrocyte lineage to investigate interactions of JCV with its host cells. Results show that infection with JCV delays oligodendrocyte maturation as shown by reduced levels of oligodendrocytic markers, including myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and platelet-derived growth factor receptor-α. Furthermore, replication of JCV in these cells caused substantial dysregulation of several chemokines, including CCL5/RANTES, GRO, CXCL1/GROα, CXCL16, CXCL8/IL-8, CXCL5/ENA-78, and CXCL10/IP-10, all of which play a role in cell growth and differentiation.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Biomimetic three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms have been developed to better emulate features of the brain's natural microenvironment. We here use our bioengineered brain-like tissue model, composed of a silk-hydrogel composite, to study the 3D microenvironment's contributions on the development and performance of dopaminergic-like neurons (DLNs). Compared with 2D culture, SH-SY5Y cells differentiated in 3D microenvironments were enriched for DLNs concomitant with a reduction in proliferative capacity during the neurodevelopmental process. Additionally, the 3D DLN cultures were more sensitive to oxidative stresses elicited by the PD-related neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP). MPP induced transcriptomic profile changes specific to 3D-differentiated DLN cultures, replicating the dysfunction of neuronal signaling pathways and mitochondrial dynamics implicated in PD. Overall, this physiologically-relevant 3D platform resembles a useful tool for studying dopamine neuron biology and interrogating molecular mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in PD.",In-vitro-study,8,0

The hemichannel blocking peptidomimetic Peptide5, derived from the second extracellular loop of the human Connexin43 protein, prevents lesion spread and reduces vascular permeability in preclinical models of central nervous system injury. The molecular mode of action of Peptide5, however, was unknown and is described here. METHODS: Human cerebral microvascular endothelial cells and APRE-19 cells were used. Scrape loading was used to assess gap junction function and hypoxic, acidic ion-shifted Ringer solution induced ATP release used to assess hemichannel function. Peptide modifications, including amino acid substitutions and truncations, and competition assays were used to demonstrate Peptide5 functional specificity and site of action respectively. RESULTS: Peptide5 inhibits Connexin43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release by acting on extracellular loop two of Connexin43, adjacent to its matching sequence within the protein. Precise sequence specificity is important for hemichannel block, but less so for uncoupling of gap junction channels (seen only at high concentrations). The SRPTEKT motif is central to Peptide5 function but on its own is not sufficient to inhibit hemichannels. Both the SRPTEKT motif and Peptide5 reduce gap junction communication, but neither uncoupling below 50%. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced gap junction coupling at high peptide concentrations appears to be relatively non-specific. However, Peptide5 at low concentrations acts upon extracellular loop two of Connexin43 to block hemichannels in a precise, sequence specific manner. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The concentration dependent and sequence specific action of Peptide5 supports its development for the treatment of retinal injury and chronic disease, as well as other central nervous system injury and disease conditions.",In-vitro-study,8,0

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of aneurysm embolization by using detachable coils under IVUS guidance. METHODS: IVUS-guided embolization in conjunction with fluoroscopic imaging and subsequently alone were performed in a silicone model with a side wall aneurysm. IVUS-guided embolization in conjunction with fluoroscopic imaging was also used in an in vitro model of a side wall aneurysm created using sheep vessels. The visibility of the aneurysm, microcatheter, and coils ascertained by the IVUS was graded as excellent, good, or poor based on visualization of these items as distinct structures. The agreement between simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images for detecting increasing intra-aneurysmal coil mass and coil prolapse was assessed in 10 and 6 simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images, respectively. RESULTS: IVUS measurements of the aneurysm dimensions strongly correlated with standardized dimensions and measurements acquired by contrast angiography (Pearson coefficient of 0.96 and 0.99 for silicone model and arterial segment model, respectively). IVUS visualization of the aneurysm, microcatheter tip, and coil loops were graded as excellent in the silicone aneurysm model and good in the carotid artery model. The agreement between simultaneously acquired angiographic and IVUS images was very high for detecting increasing intra-aneurysmal coil mass (Spearman rank correlation coefficient of 0.98) and coil prolapse (83% agreement). CONCLUSION: IVUS guidance during aneurysm embolization may improve the procedure by providing intravascular aneurysmal measurements and visualization of devices used in the procedure.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1360,827,rayyan-1270415484,Biochemistry,Chaperone-like Activity of Calnuc Prevents Amyloid Aggregation,"Calnuc is a ubiquitously expressed protein of the EF-hand Ca(2+)-binding superfamily. Previous studies have implicated it in Ca(2+)-sensitive physiological processes, whereas details of its function and involvement in human diseases are lacking. Drawing upon the sequence homology of calnuc with calreticulin, we propose it functions as a molecular chaperone-like protein. In cells under thermal, chemical [urea and guanidinium chloride (GdmCl)], and acidic stress, calnuc exhibits properties similar to those of established chaperone-like proteins (GRP78, spectrin, and α-crystallin), effectively demonstrated by its ability to suppress aggregation of malate dehydrogenase (MDH), alcohol dehydrogenase, and catalase. Calnuc aids in refolding of MDH with retention of 80% of its enzymatic activity. In HEK293 cells subjected to heat shock, calnuc chaperones luciferase, protecting its activity. Our in vitro and cell culture results establish the ability of calnuc to inhibit fibrillation of insulin and lysozyme and validate its neuroprotective role in cells treated with amyloid fibrils. Calnuc also rescues cells from fibrillar toxicity (caused by misfolded or aggregated proteins), providing a plausible explanation for the previous observation of its low level of expression in brains affected by Alzheimer's disease. We propose that calnuc is possibly involved in controlling protein unfolding diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), prion disease, and type II diabetes.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In previous publications ANA presented excellent in vitro/in vivo efficacy data, especially with fibrin-rich hard clots. We aimed to determine the main physical property responsible for these results, namely suction force versus aspiration flow. METHODS: We evaluated in a bench model the suction force and flow generated by ANA and compared them to other neurovascular catheters combined with a SR (Solitaire). Aspiration flow was evaluated with a flow rate sensor while applying vacuum pressure with a pump. Suction force was determined using a tensile strength testing machine and a purposely designed tool that completely seals the device tip simulating complete occlusion by a hard clot. Suction force was defined as the force needed to separate the device from the clot under aspiration. All experiments were repeated five times, and mean values used for comparisons. RESULTS: Aspiration flow increased with the inner diameter of the device: ANA 1.85±0.04 mL/s, ACE68 3.74±0.05 mL/s, and 8F-Flowgate2 5.96±0.30 mL/s (P<0.001). After introducing the SR, the flow was reduced by an average of 0.57±0.12 mL/s. Due to its larger distal surface, ANA suction force (1.69±0.40 N) was significantly higher than ACE68 (0.26±0.04 N) and 8F-Flowgate2 (0.42±0.06 N) (P<0.001). After introducing the SR, suction force variation was not relevant except for ANA that increased to 2.64±0.41 N. CONCLUSION: Despite lower in vitro aspiration flow, the ANA design showed a substantially higher suction force than other thrombectomy devices.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Hypoxic injury results in increased neuronal death, which disrupts normal brain development. Although animal model systems have been useful to study the effects of NHI, they do not fully represent the uniqueness and complexities of the human brain. To better understand the effects of hypoxia on human brain development, we have generated a brain organoid protocol and evaluated these cells over the course of 6 months. As anticipated, the expression of a forebrain marker, FOXG1, increased and then remained expressed over time, while there was a transition in the expression of the deep-layer (TBR1) and upper-layer (SATB2) cortical markers. In addition, ventral genes (Eng1 and Nkx2.1) as well as markers of specialized nonneuronal cells (Olig2 and GFAP) also increased at later time points. We next tested the development of our in vitro cerebral organoid model at different oxygen concentrations and found that hypoxia repressed gene markers for forebrain, oligodendrocytes, glial cells, and cortical layers, as well as genes important for the migration of cortical neurons. In contrast, ventral markers were either unaffected or even increased in expression with hypoxic insult. Interestingly, the negative effect of hypoxia on the dorsal brain genes as well as oligodendrocytes, and neuronal progenitors could be mitigated by the use of minocycline, an FDA-approved small molecule. Taken together, we have generated a unique and relevant in vitro human brain model system to study diseases such as NHI as well as their potential treatments. Using this system, we have shown the efficacy of minocycline for human NHI.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Although this white matter degeneration is partly attributable to axonopathy associated with neuronal degeneration, amyloid β (Aβ) protein-mediated damage to oligodendrocytes could be another mechanism. To test this hypothesis, we studied effects of soluble Aβ in oligomeric form on survival and differentiation of cells of the oligodendroglial lineage using highly purified oligodendroglial cultures from rats at different developmental stages. Aβ oligomer at 10 μM or higher reduced survival of mature oligodendrocytes, whereas oligodendroglial progenitor cells (OPCs) were relatively resistant to the Aβ oligomer-mediated cytotoxicity. Further study revealed that Aβ oligomer even at 1 μM accelerated 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) formazan exocytosis in mature oligodendrocytes, and, more significantly, inhibited myelin sheet formation after induction of in vitro differentiation of OPCs. These results imply a novel pathogenetic mechanism underlying Aβ oligomer-mediated white matter degeneration, which could impair myelin maintenance and remyelination by adult OPCs, resulting in accumulating damage to myelinating axons thereby contributing to neural disconnections.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Although several BET inhibitors have entered clinical trials, few are brain penetrant. We have generated UM-002, a novel brain penetrant BET inhibitor that reduces GBM cell proliferation in vitro and in a human cerebral brain organoid model. Since UM-002 is more potent than other BET inhibitors, it could potentially be developed for GBM treatment. Furthermore, UM-002 treatment reduces the expression of cell-cycle related genes in vivo and reduces the expression of invasion related genes within the non-proliferative cells present in tumors as measured by single cell RNA-sequencing. These studies suggest that BET inhibition alters the transcriptional landscape of GBM tumors, which has implications for designing combination therapies. Importantly, they also provide an integrated dataset that combines in vitro and ex vivo studies with in vivo single-cell RNA-sequencing to characterize a novel BET inhibitor in GBM.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Focusing on alternative treatment strategies, we evaluated the oncolytic potential of varicella zoster virus (VZV) in malignant glioma cell cultures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Replication of wildtype and mutant VZV was comparatively analyzed in glioma cell lines (U87, U251 and U373) and in primary malignant glioma cells (n=10) in vitro by infectious foci assay, immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot analysis. Additionally, the tumor-targeting potential of VZV-infected human mesenchymal stem cells was evaluated. RESULTS: VZV replicated efficiently in all the glioma cells studied here followed by rapid oncolysis in vitro. The attenuated vaccine VZV mutant rOKA/ORF63rev[T171] exhibited most efficient replication. Human mesenchymal stem cells were found suitable for targeting VZV to sites of tumor growth.

METHODS: Three independent variables, including clot type, device (Merci Retriever, Solitaire FR, and Trevo devices), and use of a balloon guide catheter, were used to ascertain the impact of proximal flow control on the size and number of distal emboli generated during thrombectomy. Secondary end points were the recanalization rate and amount of flow restored. RESULTS: Use of the balloon guide catheter during thrombectomy of the fragile, hard clot significantly reduced the formation of large distal emboli with a diameter >1 mm, regardless of the device used (P<0.01). Applying aspiration via the balloon guide catheter in place of the conventional guide catheter resulted in a significant increase of flow reversal (P<0.0001). Prior to thrombectomy, deployment of the stent-trievers produced immediate flow restoration through the soft and hard clot occlusions, 69.2 ± 27.3 and 45.5 ± 22.8 mL/min, respectively, that was preserved after the balloon inflation because of collateral flow via the posterior communication artery. After deployment but before thrombectomy, no flow was restored when using the Merci Retriever. After thrombectomy, complete flow restoration was achieved in a majority of cases. The Merci Retriever required more thrombectomy attempts to achieve hard clot removal compared with the stent-trievers when the conventional guide catheter was used (1.5 versus 1.1). CONCLUSIONS: The risk of distal embolization was significantly reduced with the use of the balloon guide catheter.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Here we assess whether MPD suppresses interleukin-1β (IL-1β)- and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2)-induced CGRP release in a cell culture model of trigeminal ganglia cells, which could account for the preventive effect in migraine and cluster headache. Metoprolol﻿(MTP), a migraine preventive with a slow onset of action, was used for comparison. METHODS: Primary cultures of rat trigeminal ganglia were stimulated for 24 h with 10 ng/ml IL-1β or for 4 h with 10 μM PGE2 following the exposure to 10 or 100 μM MPD or 100 nM or 10 µM MTP for 45 min or 24 h. CGRP was determined by using a commercial enzyme immunoassay. RESULTS: MPD but not MTP blocked IL-1β-induced CGRP release from cultured trigeminal cells. PGE2-stimulated CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cell culture was not affected by pre-stimulation whether with MPD or MTP. CONCLUSION: MPD but not MTP suppresses cytokine (IL-1β)-induced CGRP release from trigeminal ganglia cells. We propose that blockade of cytokine mediated trigeminal activation may represent a potential mechanism of action that mediates the preventive effect of MTP on cluster headache and recurrent migraine attacks.",In-vitro-study,8,0

AIM: The phenotypical and immunocytochemical characterization of primary cell lines from glioblastoma specimens during establishment is of great importance, in order to reliably identify these cell lines as primary glioblastoma cell lines. METHODS AND RESULTS: Sixteen primary adherent cell lines out of 34 glioblastoma samples (47%) were established and further characterized. For phenotypical characterization, morphology and growth characteristics of the cells were classified. The cell lines had a high growth rate with a doubling time of 2 to 14 days. Morphologically, the cells displayed spindle-form or polygonal to amorphous shapes and grow as monolayer or in foci without evidence of contact inhibition. The cells were able to migrate and to form colonies. For further characterization, the protein expression of the astrocyte-specific protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), the glial marker S100B, the neuronal marker TUBB3, and malignancy marker VIM, as well as the progenitor markers NES and SOX2, the proliferation marker MKI67, and the fibroblast marker TE7 were determined. Based on the immunocytochemical validation criterion of a coexpression of GFAP and S100B, 15 out of these 16 cell lines (94%) were defined as primary glioblastoma cell lines (pGCL). All 15 pGCL expressed TUBB3 and VIM. NES and SOX2 were stained positively in 13/15 and 6/15 pGCL. MKI67 was expressed in 11/15 and TE7 in 2/15 pGCL. CONCLUSION: These results point out that in self-established primary adherent glioblastoma cell lines, the expression of the specific astrocytic and glial markers GFAP and S100B and of the malignancy and progenitor markers VIM, NES, and SOX2 has to be validated. These data show that primary cell lines of glioblastoma origin with high malignant potential are reliably to establish using standardized validation criteria.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Consequently, development of new compounds capable of preventing tau hyperphosphorylation is an increasingly hot topic. For this reason, dependable in vitro and in vivo models that reflect tau hyperphosphorylation in human diseases are needed. In this study, we generated and validated an in vitro model appropriate to test potential curative and preventive compound effects on tau phosphorylation. For this purpose, a stably transfected SH-SY5Y cell line was constructed over-expressing mutant human tau441 (SH-SY5Y-TMHT441). Analyses of expression levels and tau phosphorylation status in untreated cells confirmed relevance to human diseases. Subsequently, the effect of different established kinase inhibitors on tau phosphorylation (e.g., residues Thr231, Thr181, and Ser396) was examined. It was shown with several methods including immunosorbent assays and mass spectrometry that the phosphorylation pattern of tau in SH-SY5Y-TMHT441 cells can be reliably modulated by these compounds, specifically targeting JNK, GSK-3, CDK1/5, and CK1. These four protein kinases are known to be involved in in vivo tau phosphorylation and are therefore authentic indicators for the suitability of this new cell culture model for tauopathies.",In-vitro-study,8,0

However, the pathogenesis of AD are very complicated, and the theories of Aβ and neurofibrillary tangles cannot explain all pathological alterations and clinical symptoms. Here, we used three-dimensional (3D) neural organoids culture derived from mouse induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to investigate the pathological mechanisms of AD. In this study, AD cerebral organoids were generated by overexpressing familial AD mutations (APP and PS1 genes) in mouse induced pluripotent stem cells, so that the early pathogenesis of AD could be investigated well with protein and cellular phenotype analyses. The results showed that AD cerebral organoids appeared some AD pathological alterations, and high levels of Aβ and p-Tau were induced as well. Furthermore, the number of GFAP-positive astrocytes and glutamatergic excitatory neurons increased significantly, but the number of GABAergic interneurons decreased. In conclusion, we suggest that cerebral organoids are a suitable AD model for scientific study, and that will provide us a novel insight into the understanding of the pathogenesis of AD.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1378,845,rayyan-1270415394,Food Funct,Differential expression of microRNAs contributed to the health efficacy of EGCG in in vitro subarachnoid hemorrhage model,"(-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) exhibits a broader spectrum health efficacy in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) therapy; the mechanisms, however, are largely unknown. Given that miRNAs play important roles in regulation of thousands of gene expressions, the effect of EGCG on the expression of miRNAs was investigated to explore the multi-targeting actions of EGCG by using an in vitro SAH model. MTT and western blot assays were used to assess the health effects of EGCG in SAH progression; the results showed that oxyhemoglobin (OxyHb)-induced cell proliferation and excessive autophagic activation were significantly inhibited by 50 μM EGCG, but not by 1 μM EGCG. By high throughput sequencing analysis, the miRNA profiles of normal, SAH and EGCG (1 and 50 μM) groups were compared and a total of 953 miRNAs were identified. Of 192 differentially expressed miRNAs, 43 miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in SAH (p < 0.01). However, EGCG significantly increased the number of differential expressions of miRNAs, which showed 144 and 138 miRNAs (112 and 115 upregulated, 32 and 23 downregulated, p < 0.01) in 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups, respectively. Among all the differentially expressed miRNAs, 13 miRNAs were shared by the three groups. 5 miRNAs (miR-218-5p, miR-218b, miR-143-3p, miR-101a-3p, miR-30a-3p) were detected in both SAH and EGCG 1 μM groups, and 104 miRNAs were shared by the EGCG 1 μM and EGCG 50 μM groups. Only 1 miRNA (miR-532-5p) was discovered in both SAH and EGCG 50 μM groups. Moreover, 24, 22 and 20 specific differentially expressed miRNAs were discovered in SAH, 1 μM and 50 μM EGCG groups, respectively. The predicted target genes of differentially expressed miRNAs showed that the most impacted MAPK signaling pathway, particularly the upregulated p38 expression in the SAH group, was restored to the normal level in both EGCG groups, but the calcium signaling pathway was enriched only in the EGCG 50 μM group. These results revealed that differential expression of miRNAs is fundamental to understand the multiple targets actions of EGCG in SAH therapy, and simultaneously targeting more robust signaling pathways could determine the therapeutic effects of EGCG.",In-vitro-study,8,0
1379,846,rayyan-1270417309,Neurosci Lett,Effects of particulate matter and nicotine for the MPP+-induced SH-SY5Y cells: Implication for Parkinson's disease,"Exposure to particulate matter (PM) has been considered a potential risk factor for various neurodegenerative diseases, whereas nicotine has protective effects on Parkinson's disease (PD). However, it is still unclear whether or how PM alone and in combination with nicotine affects the pathogenesis of PD. We investigated the potential neurotoxicity of PM and the protective properties of nicotine in an in vitro PD model. A 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridimium (MPP+)-induced neurotoxicity model was established with SH-SY5Y cells. Cell viability and apoptosis were measured using MTT and TUNEL assays, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using the cell-permeant fluorescent probe DCFH-DA. We investigated mitochondrial apoptotic markers such as Bax, Bcl2, cytochrome C, and cleaved caspase-3 and analyzed their levels by Western blotting. SH-SY5Y cells exposed to PM and MPP+ exhibited significantly increased intracellular ROS and decreased cell viability with those exposed to PM alone. PM strikingly exacerbated MPP+-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, including an increase in the Bax/Bcl2 ratio and the release of cytochrome C and cleaved caspase-3. On the other hand, pretreatment of SH-SY5Y cells with nicotine reduced the MPP+-induced loss of cell viability and levels of intracellular ROS and mitochondrial apoptotic signaling proteins. However, pretreatment with nicotine did not prevent PM-induced toxicity in MPP+-treated SHSY5Y cells. PM and MPP+ synergistically increased ROS levels and mitochondrial apoptosis, which led to SH-SY5Y cell death. The protective effect of nicotine cannot rescue PM-induced synergistic neurotoxicity in the MPP+-induced PD model. Our findings verified the opposing roles of PM and nicotine in a model of PD pathogenesis. A large number of in vivo and in vitro studies would verify the roles of PM and nicotine in the future.",In-vitro-study,8,0

METHODS: Nine hundred and twelve specimens from a variety of clinical sites, including ocular, mucocutaneous, respiratory and genital material, urines and necropsy tissue, were compared by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and conventional culture for the presence of HSV. RESULTS: The EIA performed to a high level of sensitivity and specificity using a variety of specimen types. Some problems were encountered using cervical swabs from pregnant women and necropsy brain tissue. Analysis of clinical and contact history data of most patients giving discrepant results supported the evidence of recent HSV infection obtained by EIA. The mean culture time was 2.4 days (range one to eight days). CONCLUSIONS: The HSV EIA test performed to a high level of sensitivity (93.7%) and specificity (96.6%) when compared with culture using a variety of clinical material. These results assumed cell culture was 100% sensitive and specific. The actual performance of the EIA test is probably much higher.

TDP-43 regulates RNA metabolism, trafficking, and localization of thousands of target genes. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which dysfunction of TDP-43 contributes to disease pathogenesis and progression remain unclear. Severe changes in the structure of neuronal dendritic arbors disrupt proper circuit connectivity, which in turn could contribute to neurodegenerative disease. Although aberrant dendritic morphology has been reported in non-TDP-43 mouse models of ALS and in human ALS patients, this phenotype is largely unexplored with regards to TDP-43. Here we have employed a primary rodent neuronal culture model to study the cellular effects of TDP-43 dysfunction in hippocampal and cortical neurons. We show that manipulation of TDP-43 expression levels causes significant defects in dendritic branching and outgrowth, without an immediate effect on cell viability. The effect on dendritic morphology is dependent on the RNA-binding ability of TDP-43. Thus, this model system will be useful in identifying pathways downstream of TDP-43 that mediate dendritic arborization, which may provide potential new avenues for therapeutic intervention in ALS/FTD.",In-vitro-study,8,0

In the present study, we used an in vitro BTB model, a RhoA inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme) and a ROCK inhibitor (Y27632) to determine whether RhoA/ROCK pathway play a role in the process of TJ disassembly, stress fiber formation, MLC and cofilin phosphorylation, as well as increase of BTB permeability induced by EMAP II. The results revealed that BTB permeability was increased by EMAP II induction, and C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 could partially inhibit the EMAP II-induced increase of BTB permeability. The significant down-regulations in tight junction (TJ)-associated proteins occludin, claudin-5 and ZO-1 and stress fiber formation by EMAP II administration were observed, which were partly prevented by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 pretreatment. Moreover, the significant increases in RhoA activity, myosin light chain (MLC) and cofilin phosphorylation by EMAP II administration were observed, MLC and cofilin phosphorylation were partly inhibited by C3 exoenzyme or Y27632 pretreatment. The present study demonstrates that the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling in RBMECs was required for the increase of BTB permeability and these effects are related with the ability for RhoA/ROCK to mediate TJ disassembly and stress fiber formation by phosphorylating cofilin and MLC.",In-vitro-study,8,0

Each treatment was administered for three weeks and, at the end of each treatment period, assessments were made of chorea and a number of psychological variables. None of the treatments significantly affected chorea measurements. With regard to the psychological variables, the levels of irritability, the frequency of angry outbursts and depression did appear to be affected in some patients by the treatment. Three patients improved on a combination of lithium carbonate and haloperidol while the remaining three did not. Haloperidol alone significantly raised depression ratings above levels for other treatments including placebo.

METHODS: A total of 135 patients with HD were randomized to enter a multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial on the efficacy of 2 g/d ethyl-EPA vs placebo. The Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) was used for assessment. The primary end point was outcome at 12 months on the Total Motor Score 4 subscale (TMS-4). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and a chi2 test on response, defined as absence of increase in the TMS-4, were performed. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients completed 12 months, and 83 did so without protocol violations (PP cohort). Intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis revealed no significant difference between ethyl-EPA and placebo for TMS-4. In the PP cohort, ethyl-EPA proved better than placebo on the chi2 test on TMS-4 (p < 0.05), but missed significance on ANCOVA (p = 0.06). Secondary end points (ITT cohort) showed no benefit of ethyl-EPA but a significantly worse outcome in the behavioral severity and frequency compared with placebo. Exploring moderators of the efficacy of ethyl-EPA on TMS-4 showed a significant interaction between treatment and a factor defining patients with high vs low CAG repeats. Reported adverse events were distributed equally between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl-eicosapentaenoate (ethyl-EPA) (purity > 95%) had no benefit in the intent-to-treat cohort of patients with Huntington disease, but exploratory analysis revealed that a significantly higher number of patients in the per protocol cohort, treated with ethyl-EPA, showed stable or improved motor function.

We examined whether intranasal insulin offered a beneficial effect across measures of cognitive function in adults with MDD. METHODS: Thirty-five adults (18-65 years of age: 47.09±9.89) meeting criteria for a major depressive episode as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV-Treatment Revised were included in this randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design study. Subjects were not stratified based on baseline cognitive deficit. Subjects were randomized to 4 weeks of either intranasal insulin 40 International Units (IU) taken four times a day (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening, and before bed) (QID) (n=19) or placebo (n=16). RESULTS: No between group differences were observed in change from baseline on total Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score (25.98±2.81), in either of the Positive or Negative subscales of the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), or on a global index of neurocognition. The possibility of practice and/or carry over effect could not be excluded. Methodological refinement (e.g., stratification of subjects based on baseline cognitive deficit) may have augmented assay sensitivity.

During the double-blind phase 174 patients received pramipexole and 180 placebo. In agreement with previous studies, pramipexole treatment improved UPDRS sum scores of parts II and III by 30% and off times by approximately 2.5 hours per day. Differences between the treatment groups became significant at a daily dose of 0.75 mg of pramipexole dihydrochloride. We, furthermore, performed post hoc analyses with respect to resting tremor and depression. Patients with pronounced resting tremor derived a clear benefit from pramipexole treatment compared with placebo. In addition, pramipexole significantly improved the subitems motivation/initiative and depression in a subpopulation with increased Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I scores at the time of inclusion. There were 262 patients who were subsequently enrolled into the open-label study featuring a maximum duration of up to 57 months. Statistical analysis revealed good long-term efficacy and tolerability of pramipexole. Overall, only a low prevalence of somnolence was found. In summary, this study provides additional level I evidence of the usefulness of pramipexole, suggests a particular tremorlytic and a possible antidepressant action of this compound, and addresses for the first time its efficacy and safety during long-term administration in advanced PD.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Patients received either placebo, 1-4 mg/day (lower dose) rivastigmine, or 6-12 mg/day (higher dose) rivastigmine. Doses were increased in one of two fixed dose ranges (1-4 mg/day or 6-12 mg/day) over the first 12 weeks with a subsequent assessment period of 14 weeks. SETTING: 45 centres in Europe and North America. PARTICIPANTS: 725 patients with mild to moderately severe probable Alzheimer's disease diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, and the criteria of the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale, rating on the clinician interview based impression of change incorporating caregiver information scale, and the progressive deterioration scale. RESULTS: At the end of the study cognitive function had deteriorated among those in the placebo group. Scores on the Alzheimer's disease assessment scale improved in patients in the higher dose group when compared with patients taking placebo (P<0.05). Significantly more patients in the higher dose group had improved by 4 points or more than had improved in the placebo group (24% (57/242) v 16% (39/238)). Global function as rated by the clinician interview scale had significantly improved among those in the higher dose group compared with those taking placebo (P<0.001), and significantly more patients in the higher dose group showed improvement than did in the placebo group (37% (80/219) v 20% (46/230)). Mean scores on the progressive deterioration scale improved from baseline in patients in the higher dose group but fell in the placebo group. Adverse events were predominantly gastrointestinal, of mild to moderate severity, transient, and occurred mainly during escalation of the dose. 23% (55/242) of those in the higher dose group, 7% (18/242) of those in the lower dose group, and 7% (16/239) of those in the placebo group discontinued treatment because of adverse events.

DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial followed by open-label extension. SETTING: 40 US centers. PATIENTS: Adults with closed TBI (N = 117), Glasgow Coma Scale score >8 at time of injury; baseline Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) ≥10; sleep latency <8 minutes on multiple sleep latency test (MSLT); and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-S) score ≥4 for excessive sleepiness. INTERVENTION: Patients received armodafinil (50, 150, or 250 mg/day) or placebo for 12 weeks followed by an optional 12-month open-label extension. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Outcomes included MSLT, ESS, Clinical Global Impression-Change (CGI-C), TBI-Work Instability Scale (TBI-WIS), CGI-S, and tolerability. The study was terminated early due to low enrollment. Patients receiving 250 mg armodafinil showed significant improvement in sleep latency from baseline to final visit versus placebo (+7.2 minutes vs. +2.4 minutes; p = 0.0010). CGI-C ratings were much/ very much improved in approximately 50% of patients receiving 150 and 250 mg armodafinil, compared to 38% on placebo. ESS and TBI-WIS scores were not significantly different between groups. In the open-label extension (N = 49), patients demonstrated gradual improvement in ESS, TBI-WIS, and CGI-S scores up to 48 weeks post-baseline. Armodafinil was generally well tolerated, with headache the most common adverse event in both double-blind and open-label portions. CONCLUSIONS: Armodafinil 250 mg significantly improved sleep latency in patients with excessive sleepiness associated with mild or moderate TBI.

However, the effects of statins on Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been determined. OBJECTIVE: Considering that plasma Aβ are related to Aβ deposition in the brain, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on plasma Aβ transport. METHODS: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. One hundred and twenty patients with hyperlipidemia were randomly assigned to receive 40 mg of simvastatin per day or matching placebo for 12 weeks (sixty patients per group). Plasma Aβ, sLRP1, sRAGE, and lipid levels were measured at baseline and at the 6-week and 12-week visits. RESULTS: The ITT database ultimately included 108 participants (placebo group: n = 53; simvastatin group: n = 55) and 64 (59.3%) were women, ranging in age from 45 to 75 years (mean 57.2±6.9 years). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that, after 12 weeks of follow-up, compared with the placebo group, ΔAβ42 levels (the change of Aβ42 levels from baseline at week 12) increased more and ΔsRAGE levels decreased more in the simvastatin group (Aβ42: β= 5.823, p = 0.040; sRAGE: β= -72.012, p = 0.031), and a significant negative association was found between ΔAβ42 and ΔsRAGE levels (β= -0.115, p = 0.045).

METHODS: In this 11-week randomized, active-controlled, rater-blinded phase III study, eligible patients were randomly assigned to either receive piribedil or to continue on pramipexole or ropinirole. The primary outcome was the median reaction times during the second 15 minutes of the subtest ""vigilance"" of the Test battery for Attention Performances (TAP). Secondary outcomes included the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, neuropsychological testing, and items of the Clinical Global Impression. RESULTS: Forty-four patients received piribedil; 36 continued on either pramipexole or ropinirole. There was no difference in the primary end point reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance between piribedil and the comparator (996 vs 954 milliseconds, P = 0.68). Piribedil reduced daytime sleepiness with lower Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores at the end of treatment compared with the comparator (-4 vs -2 points; P = 0.01). The median Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score at the end of treatment was comparable between the 2 groups. Neuropsychological tests revealed no significant between-treatment differences. A higher therapeutic effect and global improvement were shown by the Clinical Global Impression of piribedil-treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that switching from pramipexole or ropinirole to piribedil has no effect on the reaction time of the TAP subtest vigilance but upholds the same therapeutic motor effect and reduces daytime sleepiness to a clinically relevant degree in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Ubiquitous brain expression of PPAR delta, its critical role in regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, and the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like phenotype of PPAR delta null mice motivated this study. OBJECTIVE: To determine safety and tolerability of multiple doses of T3D-959 in subjects with mild to moderate AD, examine systemic and central drug pharmacology and in an exploratory manner, perform cognitive assessments. METHODS: Thirty-four subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were orally administered 3, 10, 30, or 90 mg of T3D-959 daily for 14 days. There was no inclusion of a placebo arm. Safety and tolerability were monitored. Systemic drug pharmacology was examined via plasma metabolomics LC-MS-MS analysis, cerebral drug pharmacology via FDG-PET measures of changes in Relative CMRgl (R CMRgl, AD-effected regions relative to brain reference regions), and cognitive function assessed before and after drug treatment and again one week after completion of drug treatment, by ADAS-cog11 and the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST). RESULTS: T3D-959 was in general safe and well tolerated. Single point pharmacokinetics at the Tmax showed dose dependent exposure. Plasma metabolome profile changes showed dose-dependent systemic effects on lipid metabolism and metabolism related to insulin sensitization. Relative FDG-PET imaging demonstrated dose-dependent, regional, effects of T3D-959 on R CMRgl based on the use of multiple reference regions. ADAS-cog11 and DSST cognitive assessments showed improvements with possible ApoE genotype association and pharmacodynamics related to the mechanism of drug action. CONCLUSIONS: Exploratory data from this Phase IIa clinical trial supports further clinical investigation of T3D-959 in a larger placebo-controlled clinical study.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Single doses of 0.1 - 10 mg/kg were safe and well tolerated in Western (mostly Caucasian) subjects with mild-to-moderate AD. This Phase 1, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation study was the first to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of PF-04360365 in Japanese subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 30 subjects with mild-to-moderate AD were enrolled. In each cohort, 3 subjects received PF-04360365 (0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) and 1 subject received placebo as a single 2-hour intravenous infusion. Subjects were monitored as inpatients for 24 hours and then as outpatients for 1 year. RESULTS: All subjects completed the study. There were no serious or National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade ≥ 3 adverse events, hypersensitivity reactions, or antidrug antibodies. No clinical or MRI evidence of brain microhemorrhage, cerebral edema, or encephalitis was observed. PF-04360365 plasma concentrations increased with dose, and pharmacokinetics were consistent with a small steady-state volume of distribution, slow clearance, and long elimination half-life. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):plasma ratios were < 0.5%. Plasma Aβ species showed dose-dependent increases in C(max) and AUC(∞), but CSF biomarkers did not differ clearly between treatment arms. CONCLUSIONS: PF-04360365 was safe and well tolerated in Japanese subjects. Pharmacokinetics and plasma pharmacodynamic responses in Japanese subjects were comparable to those in Western subjects. *No longer affiliated with Pfizer.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
2020,1487,rayyan-1277759012,Brain,"Riluzole, a glutamate modulator, slows cerebral glucose metabolism decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease","Dysregulation of glutamatergic neural circuits has been implicated in a cycle of toxicity, believed among the neurobiological underpinning of Alzheimer's disease. Previously, we reported preclinical evidence that the glutamate modulator riluzole, which is FDA approved for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, has potential benefits on cognition, structural and molecular markers of ageing and Alzheimer's disease. The objective of this study was to evaluate in a pilot clinical trial, using neuroimaging biomarkers, the potential efficacy and safety of riluzole in patients with Alzheimer's disease as compared to placebo. A 6-month phase 2 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was conducted at two sites. Participants consisted of males and females, 50 to 95 years of age, with a clinical diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease, and Mini-Mental State Examination between 19 and 27. Ninety-four participants were screened, 50 participants who met inclusion criteria were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg riluzole (n = 26) or placebo (n = 24) twice a day. Twenty-two riluzole-treated and 20 placebo participants completed the study. Primary end points were baseline to 6 months changes in (i) cerebral glucose metabolism as measured with fluorodeoxyglucose-PET in prespecified regions of interest (hippocampus, posterior cingulate, precuneus, lateral temporal, inferior parietal, frontal); and (ii) changes in posterior cingulate levels of the neuronal viability marker N-acetylaspartate as measured with in vivo proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Secondary outcome measures were neuropsychological testing for correlation with neuroimaging biomarkers and in vivo measures of glutamate in posterior cingulate measured with magnetic resonance spectroscopy as a potential marker of target engagement. Measures of cerebral glucose metabolism, a well-established Alzheimer's disease biomarker and predictor of disease progression, declined significantly less in several prespecified regions of interest with the most robust effect in posterior cingulate, and effects in precuneus, lateral temporal, right hippocampus and frontal cortex in riluzole-treated participants in comparison to the placebo group. No group effect was found in measures of N-acetylaspartate levels. A positive correlation was observed between cognitive measures and regional cerebral glucose metabolism. A group × visit interaction was observed in glutamate levels in posterior cingulate, potentially suggesting engagement of glutamatergic system by riluzole. In vivo glutamate levels positively correlated with cognitive performance. These findings support our main primary hypothesis that cerebral glucose metabolism would be better preserved in the riluzole-treated group than in the placebo group and provide a rationale for more powered, longer duration studies of riluzole as a potential intervention for Alzheimer's disease.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

However, there was a tendency for a significant increase in the schizophrenic symptoms of the deanol-treated group relative to the control group. The ineffectiveness of deanol in alleviating tardive dyskinesia is consistent with its inability to enhance brain acetylcholine synthesis. The worsening of the schizophrenic symptoms may possibly result from an interference by deanol with central cholinergic function.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Donepezil and memantine are both widely used for the treatment of moderate AD. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of donepezil and memantine in relieving BPSD in individuals with moderate AD. METHOD: We conducted a prospective, randomized, 6-month clinical trial involving 85 individuals with moderate AD divided into two groups: group 1 (n = 42) was treated with donepezil; group 2 (n = 43) was treated with memantine. We used the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) to assess the prevalence and severity of BPSD at baseline and after 6 months of treatment with donepezil or memantine. RESULTS: The two groups' baseline characteristics, including age, sex, mean length of education, and disease duration, were comparable, as were their baseline Mini-Mental State Examination scores. The NPI Total score improved from baseline to month 6 in both groups (P < 0.0001). Analyses of the NPI subdomains revealed that both donepezil treatment and memantine treatment produced statistically significant improvement in all of the NPI domains except euphoria and apathy, for which no improvement was observed after memantine treatment. Both treatments were well tolerated, with mostly mild and transient adverse effects. CONCLUSION: Specific drugs for AD, including donepezil and memantine, may be effective in treating BPSD in individuals with moderate AD, with a favorable safety profile.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
2023,1490,rayyan-1277753272,J Psychiatr Pract,Efficacy and safety of oral aripiprazole compared with haloperidol in patients transitioning from acute treatment with intramuscular formulations,"OBJECTIVE: To report efficacy and safety of transitioning patients receiving intramuscular (IM) formulations of aripiprazole or haloperidol to their respective oral formulations. METHODS: 448 agitated patients with schizophrenia (73%) or schizoaffective disorder (27%) were randomized to receive aripiprazole IM 9.75 mg, haloperidol IM 6.5 mg, or placebo IM within 24 hours. Patients treated with aripiprazole IM or haloperidol IM who completed this 24-hour IM phase were transitioned to the respective blinded oral formulations for 4 days (aripiprazole 10-15 mg/day, n = 153; haloperidol 7.5-10 mg/day, n = 151). Patients treated with placebo IM were transitioned to oral aripiprazole (analysis not included). The primary efficacy measure was mean change in Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale-Excited Component (PEC) score from baseline of oral phase (last value from 24-hour IM phase) to endpoint (study day 5, last observation carried forward). RESULTS: During the oral phase, aripiprazole 15 mg and haloperidol 10 mg were both effective in maintaining responses achieved on all efficacy measures during the 24-hour IM phase. Mean improvements in PEC scores from study day 1 to 5 were -1.37 for aripiprazole and -1.40 for haloperidol (p = NS for aripiprazole versus haloperidol). Oral aripiprazole was well tolerated. Extrapyramidal symptom-related adverse events were lower for aripiprazole (1.3%) than haloperidol (8.0%). Nausea and vomiting occurred more frequently in patients receiving aripiprazole (3.9% and 2.6%, respectively) than in those receiving haloperidol (0.7% and 1.3%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Acutely agitated patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder treated with aripiprazole IM or haloperidol IM demonstrated similar effective and safe transition to their respective oral formulations. Initial benefits of reduced agitation and improved clinical status during the IM phase of the study were maintained throughout the oral phase of the study with good tolerability.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

OBJECTIVES: To evaluate low-dose lithium treatment of agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). METHOD: In a four-site trial, patients with AD and agitation/aggression score ≥4 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were randomized, double-blind, to lithium carbonate 150-600 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks. Primary efficacy outcome was change in NPI agitation/aggression; secondary efficacy outcome was treatment response (30% reduction in NPI score for agitation/aggression plus psychosis and a Clinical Global Impression (CGI) score of much or very much improved). Safety profile of lithium was assessed. RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 77 patients (75.3%) completed the trial. In linear mixed effects model analyses, lithium was not significantly superior to placebo for agitation/aggression. Proportion of responders was 31.6% on lithium and 17.9% on placebo (χ(2)=1.26, p = 0.26). Moderate or marked improvement (CGI) was greater on lithium (10/38=36.8%) than placebo (0/39=0%, Fisher's exact test p <0.001). In exploratory analyses, improvement on lithium was greater than placebo on NPI delusions and irritability/lability (p's<0.05). Lithium showed greater reduction than placebo in patients with high Young Mania Rating Scale scores (β=5.06; 95%CI,1.18 to 8.94, p = 0.01). Oral dose and serum levels demonstrated similar associations with efficacy outcomes. Lithium did not differ significantly from placebo on safety outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose lithium was not efficacious in treating agitation but was associated with global clinical improvement and excellent safety.

Aducanumab is a human monoclonal antibody directed against aggregated soluble and insoluble forms of amyloid beta. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the efficacy and safety of aducanumab in early Alzheimer's disease. DESIGN: EMERGE and ENGAGE were two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, global, phase 3 studies of aducanumab in patients with early Alzheimer's disease. SETTING: These studies involved 348 sites in 20 countries. PARTICIPANTS: Participants included 1638 (EMERGE) and 1647 (ENGAGE) patients (aged 50-85 years, confirmed amyloid pathology) who met clinical criteria for mild cognitive impairment due to Alzheimer's disease or mild Alzheimer's disease dementia, of which 1812 (55.2%) completed the study. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to receive aducanumab low dose (3 or 6 mg/kg target dose), high dose (10 mg/kg target dose), or placebo via IV infusion once every 4 weeks over 76 weeks. MEASUREMENTS: The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to week 78 on the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), an integrated scale that assesses both function and cognition. Other measures included safety assessments; secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes that assessed cognition, function, and behavior; and biomarker endpoints. RESULTS: EMERGE and ENGAGE were halted based on futility analysis of data pooled from the first approximately 50% of enrolled patients; subsequent efficacy analyses included data from a larger data set collected up to futility declaration and followed prespecified statistical analyses. The primary endpoint was met in EMERGE (difference of -0.39 for high-dose aducanumab vs placebo [95% CI, -0.69 to -0.09; P=.012; 22% decrease]) but not in ENGAGE (difference of 0.03, [95% CI, -0.26 to 0.33; P=.833; 2% increase]). Results of biomarker substudies confirmed target engagement and dose-dependent reduction in markers of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The most common adverse event was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema. CONCLUSIONS: Data from EMERGE demonstrated a statistically significant change across all four primary and secondary clinical endpoints. ENGAGE did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. A dose- and time-dependent reduction in pathophysiological markers of Alzheimer's disease was observed in both trials.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

2030,1497,rayyan-1277755901,Lancet Neurol,"Doxycycline in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease: a phase 2, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial","BACKGROUND: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal, untreatable prion encephalopathy. Previous studies showed that doxycycline is effective in in-vitro and in-vivo models of disease, and patients with CJD who received compassionate treatment with doxycycline showed increased survival time compared with historical series. We therefore did a randomised, double-blind study of doxycycline versus placebo in CJD. METHODS: We recruited patients older than 18 years old who had a diagnosis of definite or probable sporadic CJD or genetic forms of the disease via Italian reference centres and the French national referral system. Patients were randomly assigned (ratio 1:1) to receive oral doxycycline (100 mg daily) or placebo under double-blind conditions from the day of randomisation to death. Centralised randomisation was done independently of enrolment or evaluation of patients using a minimisation method in Italy and a simple randomisation in France. Participants, caregivers, and clinicians were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy variable was the survival time from randomisation. Interim analyses were planned to detect a significant effect of treatment as early as possible. This trial is registered with EudraCT, 2006-001858-27 for the Italian study and 2007-005553-34 for the French study. FINDINGS: From April 12, 2007, to Aug 19, 2010, in Italy, and from Jan 30, 2009, to Jan 10, 2012, in France, 121 patients with CJD were enrolled in the study, 62 of whom were randomly assigned to the treatment group and 59 to the placebo group. The first interim analysis showed absence of superiority of doxycycline compared with placebo, and the trial was stopped for futility. Efficacy analyses did not show significant differences between patients treated with doxycycline and placebo with regard to survival times (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.8-1.7, p=0.50). Serious adverse events were judged not to be related to treatment, whereas a relation was deemed probable or possible for five non-serious adverse events that occurred in each treatment group. INTERPRETATION: Doxycycline at a dose of 100 mg per day was well tolerated but did not significantly affect the course of CJD, at variance with the results of previous observational studies. Our experience could be useful in the design of large multinational controlled trials of potential anti-prion molecules in this rare disease.

2033,1500,rayyan-1277751910,Pharmacopsychiatry,Cyclandelate in the treatment of patients with mild to moderate primary degenerative dementia of the Alzheimer type or vascular dementia: experience from a placebo controlled multi-center study,"A 24-week, double-blind, multi-center, randomised parallel group study compared the efficacy and safety of 800 mg bid cyclandelate with placebo in patients with mild to moderate dementia of primary degenerative or vascular origin. A total of 196 patients entered the study, 147 patients completed treatment in adherence with the protocol. Primary outcome measures were the cognitive score of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-Cog), the subscale Instrumental Activities of Daily Living of the Nurses' Observation Scale for Geriatric Patients (NOSGER-IADL) and the Clinical Global Impressions of Change (CGI-C). Safety assessments included adverse events, vital signs, ECG and clinical laboratory parameters. The primary efficacy results based on a multi-level responder analysis including ADAS-Cog, NOSGER-IADL and CGI-C failed to demonstrate statistical superiority of cyclandelate in comparison to placebo. The direction of changes favored cyclandelate in each of the variables, but the differences to placebo were small and varied considerably between patients and centers. Retrospective exploratory analyses suggested that efficacy of cyclandelate might be dependent on the severity of the disease. The treatment effects in favor of cyclandelate were statistically significant in the subgroup of moderately impaired patients (MMSE at baseline <18) for ADAS-Cog (delta = -4.0 points, p = 0.015) and CGI-C (delta = -0.4 points, p = 0.043) but not for NOSGER-IADL (delta = -1.6 points, p = 0.059). When patients were stepwise selected for the severity of the disease according to ADAS-Cog at baseline (>15, >20, >25 points), statistical significance was reached for ADAS-Cog and NOSGER-IADL beginning with the step ADAS-Cog >20 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -3.9 points, p = 0.044; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.0, p = 0.023. The treatment differences increased further with the step ADAS-Cog >25 points: delta ADAS-Cog = -7.0 points, p = 0.008; delta NOSGER-IADL = -1.7, p = 0.003.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the efficacy and tolerability of escitalopram in the treatment of depression in AD. METHODS: In this 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with open-label, 12-week extension, AD subjects over 50 years of age, with depression defined by Olin's provisional diagnostic criteria, were enrolled. The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD), and other measures of depression and cognition were repeated. RESULTS: 91 subjects were screened, and 84 were randomized into either the study group or placebo group (n = 42 for both groups). Twenty-four subjects (29%) were unable to finish the study, yielding a per protocol population of 60 subjects (study group: n = 27; placebo group: n = 33). At week 12, differences in measures of depression and cognition between the two groups were not statistically significant. However, exploratory analysis suggested that further research on a subset of subjects with 'definite major depression' (baseline CSDD score ≥18) is needed. The number of treatment-related adverse-events (AE) did not differ between groups (p = 0.83) and no serious treatment-related AE were observed. CONCLUSION: The use of escitalopram was well tolerated in depressive dementia patients. Future studies focusing on subjects with more severe levels of depression, and with more statistical power, will be needed.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The patients were selected on the basis of the EACG (Echelle d'Appréciation Clinique en Gériatrie), which was also used as main criterion for confirmatory analysis of the efficacy of naftidrofuryl. A further main criterion was the SGRS (Stockton Geriatric Rating Scale). Secondary criteria examined were visual memory as tested in the Benton test, verbal memory as tested in the Rey test and numerical memory as tested in the digit-span test. The patients' concentration was tested in the Zazzo test. The tests were performed before the patients were admitted to the study and after 1 and 3-months' treatment. Confirmatory analysis of the primary criteria showed a significant treatment difference in favour of naftidrofuryl in the form of improvement in the global symptoms of senile dementia both in the EACG and in the SGRS, the scores in the naftidrofuryl group improving by 15% compared with only 5% in the placebo group. This was paralleled by a significant improvement in visual and verbal memory in the naftidrofuryl group in comparison with placebo.

There were three phases: 4 weeks baseline, 18 weeks titration to 200-400 mg topiramate/day (adults) or 5-9 mg/kg/day (children), 12 weeks maintenance. Recruitment was low (88/120); analyses were underpowered. Seizure frequency varied enormously (median 17.7, maximum 1706.2). There was no significant difference in reduction in mean total seizure frequency or number of responders between the groups. Topiramate reduced seizure frequency by >30% from baseline (placebo 1%); post hoc analyses showed a trend toward significance (R ratio, P=0.052). There were no significant differences between the groups with respect to mean seizure severity or other outcome measures. Topiramate was generally well tolerated; body weight (P=0.015) and systolic blood pressure (P=0.043) were reduced.

DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Research center at a major urban medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects were a referred and volunteer sample of 52 participants with TBI, a diagnosis of major depression disorder (MDD), and a score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) of 18 or greater. The majority of the sample was male (58%), had less than 14 years of education (73%), had incomes below $20,000 (82%), and were from minority backgrounds (75%). Approximately one third of the sample had mild brain injuries, and two thirds had moderate to severe brain injuries. The mean age was 47+/-11, and the mean time since injury was 17+/-14 years. One participant withdrew from the study because of side effects. INTERVENTION: Daily oral sertraline in doses starting at 25mg and increasing to therapeutic levels (up to 200mg) or placebo for 10 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The HAM-D, the Beck Anxiety Inventory, and the Life-3 quality of life (QOL). RESULTS: No statistically significant differences were found at baseline between drug and placebo groups on baseline measures of depression (24.8+/-7.3 vs 27.7+/-7.0), anxiety (16.4+/-12.3 vs 24.0+/-14.9), or QOL (2.96+/-1.0 vs 2.9+/-0.9). The income level of those receiving placebo was significantly lower than those participants receiving medication. Analyses of covariance revealed significant changes from preintervention to posttreatment for all 3 outcome measures (P<.001) but no group effects. Random-effects modeling did not find any significant difference in patterns of scores of the outcome measures between the placebo and medication groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both groups showed improvements in mood, anxiety, and QOL, with 59% of the experimental group and 32% of the placebo group responding to the treatment, defined as a reduction of a person's HAM-D score by 50%.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Pre-clinical data obtained in APP23 mice suggested that the anti-cancer drug thalidomide decreases brainBACE1 and Aβ levels. This prompted us to develop an NIH-supported Phase IIa clinical trial to test the potential of thalidomide for AD. We hypothesized that thalidomide can decrease or stabilize brain amyloid deposits, which would result in slower cognitive decline in drug- versus placebo-treated subjects. METHODS: This was a 24-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study with escalating dose regimen of thalidomide with a target dose of 400mg daily in patients with mild to moderate AD. The primary outcome measures were tolerability and cognitive performance assessed by a battery of tests. RESULTS: A total of 185 subjects have been pre-screened, out of which25 were randomized. Mean age of the sample at baseline was 73.64 (±7.20) years; mean education was 14.24 (±2.3) years; mean MMSE score was 21.00 (±5.32); and mean GDS score was 2.76 (±2.28).Among the 25 participants, 14 (56%) terminated early due to adverse events, dramatically decreasing the power of the study. In addition, those who completed the study (44%) never reached the estimated therapeutic dose of 400 mg/day thalidomide because of reported adverse events. The cognitive data showed no difference between the treated and placebo groups at the end of the trial. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates AD patients have poor tolerability for thalidomide, and are unable to reach a therapeutic dose felt to be sufficient to have effects on BACE1. Because of poor tolerability, this study failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect on cognition.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

The authors hypothesized that divalproex sodium (VPA) would improve posttraumatic irritability and result in lessened alcohol use. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trial recruited participants with an index TBI occurring 1 or more years prior to enrollment, a history of alcohol use disorder, and posttraumatic irritability corroborated by a knowledgeable informant. An 8-item subset of the Agitated Behavior Scale served as the primary outcome measure of VPA efficacy. Doses of VPA were titrated to standard serum concentrations of 50 µg/ml to 100 µg/ml. RESULTS: Forty-eight persons completed this clinical trial (VPA, N=22; placebo, N=26). At baseline, participants rated their posttraumatic irritability as less severe than did their informants (p<0.05). During the trial, informants reported significant and sustained reduction of posttraumatic irritability (p=0.03) in the study participants. Biweekly averages during drug exposure confirmed this (p<0.03, Cohen's d=0.44). Treatment efficacy was not related to measures of anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, sedation, or veteran versus nonveteran status. Alcohol use did not change as a result of treatment. There were no serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated an effect of VPA on posttraumatic irritability, and VPA was well tolerated. Further definition of treatment efficacy and safety requires a large-scale multisite trial, using a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled design.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0
2045,1512,rayyan-1277756113,N Engl J Med,Two phase 3 trials of bapineuzumab in mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease,"BACKGROUND: Bapineuzumab, a humanized anti-amyloid-beta monoclonal antibody, is in clinical development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. METHODS: We conducted two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trials involving patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease--one involving 1121 carriers of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele and the other involving 1331 noncarriers. Bapineuzumab or placebo, with doses varying by study, was administered by intravenous infusion every 13 weeks for 78 weeks. The primary outcome measures were scores on the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11, with scores ranging from 0 to 70 and higher scores indicating greater impairment) and the Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD, with scores ranging from 0 to 100 and higher scores indicating less impairment). A total of 1090 carriers and 1114 noncarriers were included in the efficacy analysis. Secondary outcome measures included findings on positron-emission tomographic amyloid imaging with the use of Pittsburgh compound B (PIB-PET) and cerebrospinal fluid phosphorylated tau (phospho-tau) concentrations. RESULTS: There were no significant between-group differences in the primary outcomes. At week 78, the between-group differences in the change from baseline in the ADAS-cog11 and DAD scores (bapineuzumab group minus placebo group) were -0.2 (P=0.80) and -1.2 (P=0.34), respectively, in the carrier study; the corresponding differences in the noncarrier study were -0.3 (P=0.64) and 2.8 (P=0.07) with the 0.5-mg-per-kilogram dose of bapineuzumab and 0.4 (P=0.62) and 0.9 (P=0.55) with the 1.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. The major safety finding was amyloid-related imaging abnormalities with edema among patients receiving bapineuzumab, which increased with bapineuzumab dose and APOE ε4 allele number and which led to discontinuation of the 2.0-mg-per-kilogram dose. Between-group differences were observed with respect to PIB-PET and cerebrospinal fluid phospho-tau concentrations in APOE ε4 allele carriers but not in noncarriers. CONCLUSIONS: Bapineuzumab did not improve clinical outcomes in patients with Alzheimer's disease, despite treatment differences in biomarkers observed in APOE ε4 carriers.

2046,1513,rayyan-1277755196,BMC Neurol,Aspirin for the prevention of cognitive decline in the elderly: rationale and design of a neuro-vascular imaging study (ENVIS-ion),"BACKGROUND: This paper describes the rationale and design of the ENVIS-ion Study, which aims to determine whether low-dose aspirin reduces the development of white matter hyper-intense (WMH) lesions and silent brain infarction (SBI). Additional aims include determining whether a) changes in retinal vascular imaging (RVI) parameters parallel changes in brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); b) changes in RVI parameters are observed with aspirin therapy; c) baseline cognitive function correlates with MRI and RVI parameters; d) changes in cognitive function correlate with changes in brain MRI and RVI and e) whether factors such as age, gender or blood pressure influence the above associations. METHODS/DESIGN: Double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of three years duration set in two Australian academic medical centre outpatient clinics. This study will enrol 600 adults aged 70 years and over with normal cognitive function and without overt cardiovascular disease. Subjects will undergo cognitive testing, brain MRI and RVI at baseline and after 3 years of study treatment. All subjects will be recruited from a 19,000-patient clinical outcome trial conducted in Australia and the United States that will evaluate the effects of aspirin in maintaining disability-free longevity over 5 years. The intervention will be aspirin 100 mg daily versus matching placebo, randomized on a 1:1 basis. DISCUSSION: This study will improve understanding of the mechanisms at the level of brain and vascular structure that underlie the effects of aspirin on cognitive function. Given the limited access and high cost of MRI, RVI may prove useful as a tool for the identification of individuals at high risk for the development of cerebrovascular disease and cognitive decline.

2048,1515,rayyan-1277753252,J Clin Psychiatry,Treatment of tardive dyskinesia with galantamine: a randomized controlled crossover trial,"OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence suggests that tar-dive dyskinesia may result from antipsychotic-induced damage to striatal cholinergic neurons. To test whether cholinesterase inhibitors compensate for diminished cholinergic activity, we conducted a 30-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial of galantamine in patients with tardive dyskinesia. METHOD: Patients with tardive dyskinesia were recruited between June 2001 and June 2004. After a 2-week baseline period, 35 male schizophrenia patients, on stable doses of antipsychotics, were randomly assigned to receive galantamine (8-24 mg) or placebo for two 12-week phases separated by a 4-week washout period. Patients were evaluated every 2 weeks for changes in extrapyramidal symptoms and before and after each treatment for effects on psychiatric symptoms and cognition. RESULTS: Galantamine reduced mean total Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS) scores more than placebo, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = .08). However, patients initially randomly assigned to galantamine showed a reversal of AIMS scores after switching to placebo. Simpson-Angus Scale ratings of parkinsonism were significantly higher with galantamine than placebo (p = .0005) and correlated with age. There were no significant differences between groups in akathisia, cognition, or psychiatric symptoms. More patients dropped out while receiving galantamine, but this outcome did not significantly influence the results. CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to previous reports, reductions in tardive dyskinesia associated with galantamine were not statistically significant compared with placebo in this trial. However, galantamine was associated with a modest rebound in dyskinesia scores after discontinuation and clinically minor but statistically higher ratings of parkinsonism. These findings support the need for further investigations of cholinergic mechanisms underlying tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal effects of cholinesterase inhibitors when used in combination with antipsychotics in susceptible patients.

Therefore, we report on the development of the interventions, the study design and protocols of a randomised controlled multi-centre trial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to develop a qigong intervention and an exercise therapy for elderly patients and to evaluate whether qigong is more effective than (1) no treatment or (2) the exercise therapy. DEVELOPMENT OF THE INTERVENTIONS: In a consensus process with qigong experts and physiotherapists special interventions for elderly patients were developed allowing most exercises to be performed in a sitting position. Both interventions will be held by qualified therapists for a period of 3 months twice per week for 45 min. In addition, patients will be encouraged to exercise on their own. STUDY PROTOCOL: In a randomised controlled multi-centre study with 3 groups and a total follow-up time of 6 months, 120 patients from 4 residences for elderly people in Berlin (age >or= 55 years) with chronic neck pain should be included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Average pain intensity of the past 7 days measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary parameters are neck pain and disability (Neck Pain and Disability Scale, NPAD), depression (General Depression Scale, ADS) and health-related quality of life (SF-36).

Conventional therapies are limited due to the insufficient benefits and side effects, and fire needling therapy is considered an alternative for post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a study protocol for a pilot randomised, two-arm, single-centre, clinical trial at Beijing Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine Affiliated to Capital Medical University. The trial started in March 2023 and is expected to end in December 2024. A total of 60 patients (aged 40-75 years, male or female) with post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb will be randomly assigned to treatment group (fire needling therapy, 5 sessions per week for 2 weeks) or control group (manual acupuncture, 5 sessions per week for 2 weeks) in a 1:1 ratio using block randomisation and opaque envelopes. Fire needling therapy or manual acupuncture will be performed in ten acupoints. Participants will complete the trial by visiting the research centre at Week 14 for a follow-up assessment. The primary outcome is the response rate. Secondary outcomes include FMA, Barthel Scale/Index (BI), pain threshold (PPT), and muscle elasticity modulus (using shear wave elastography [SWE]). A chi-squared test will be used for response rate. A mixed-effects linear model and a mixed-effects model will be used for FMA, BI, PPT, and SWE, respectively. DISCUSSION: This is the first standardised protocol to compare the effectiveness of fire needling therapy and manual acupuncture. We will use a rigorous methodology to minimise bias and set up supervising committees to ensure the quality of our study, thus providing trustworthy evidence for better understanding of fire needling therapy in treating post-stroke CRPS of the upper limb.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
2051,1518,rayyan-1270388811,F1000Res,Association between obesity and depression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2; a study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus and depression are highly prevalent conditions throughout the world and have significant impact on health outcomes. It has been estimated that diabetes mellitus type 2 affects about 246 million people in the world; nevertheless, incidence varies among countries. There is evidence that depression is associated with a poor metabolic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus that present other health problems (such as hypertension and obesity). The aim of this study protocol is to determine if obesity increases the risk for depression in patient with diabetes type 2. METHODS: The analysis will be reported following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).The studies suitable for inclusion will be assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) to determine their methodological quality. To identify the studies of interest, we will search on PubMed and EBSCO databases. We will use the following keyword combinations: ""Diabetes Mellitus type 2 AND obesity AND depression"", ""depression AND Diabetes Mellitus type 2"", ""Diabetes Mellitus type 2 AND body mass index cross sectional study"", ""depression AND obesity cross-sectional study"". Causes for exclusion will be publications that studied patients diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 1; articles that focused on the treatment and complications of diabetes mellitus type 2; publications that have studied other clinical or psychiatric conditions (for instance, seizure disorder or history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, psychotic symptoms or dementia). CONCLUSION: The results of this study will form the basis for a better understanding of the association between obesity and depression in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2, and will allow development of prediction tools and better interventions. It is evident that several modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetes among population. Currently, evidence for the deleterious effects of diabetes mellitus type 2 are based on cross-sectional or other observational designs. Therefore, this study will have important implications for future research and public health guidance.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Currently, a wide range of treatment options are available with recurrence rates varying between 7 and 42%. Pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) is a treatment option for increased pelvic floor muscle tone and dyssynergia which often accompanies CAF. However, literature on this subject is scarce. The Pelvic Floor Anal Fissure (PAF)-study aims to determine the efficacy and effectiveness of PFPT on improvement on pelvic floor muscle tone and function, pain, healing of the fissure, quality of life and complaint reduction in patients with CAF. METHODS: The PAF-study is a single-centre, two armed, randomized controlled trial. Patients with CAF and pelvic floor dysfunction are eligible for inclusion. Exclusion criteria include abscess, fistula, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, anorectal malignancy, prior rectal radiation, and pregnancy. A total of 140 patients will be randomized for either PFPT or postponed treatment of PFPT.The primary outcome is tone at rest during electromyographic registration of the pelvic floor before and after therapy. Secondary outcomes consist of healing of the fissure, pain ratings, improvement of pelvic floor function, complaint reduction and quality of life. Primary and secondary endpoints are measured at 8 and 20 weeks and at 1-year follow-up. DISCUSSION: Currently, there is a gap in treatment modalities between conservative management and surgery.

Each review has a Plain Language Summary (PLS), for those without specialised knowledge, and an abstract, which are freely available from The Cochrane Library (https://summaries.cochrane.org). Increasingly, evidence is being distributed using social media such as Twitter and Weibo (in China) alongside traditional publications. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a prospective two-arm, parallel, open randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio, we will allocate 170 published systematic reviews into the intervention group (tweeting arm/Weibo arm) versus the control group (non-tweeting arm). Reviews will be stratified by baseline access activity, defined as high (≥19 views per week, n=14), medium (4.3 to 18.99 views per week, n=72) or low (<4.3 views per week, n=84), based on Google Analytics, which will also be used for evaluating outcomes. The intervention group will have three tweets daily using Hootsuite with a slightly different accompanying text (written by CEA and AB) and a shortened Uniform Resource Locator (URL) to the PLS: a) The review title as it appears in summaries.cochrane.org, b) A pertinent extract from results or discussion sections of the abstract and c) An intriguing question or pithy statement related to the evidence in the abstract.

Whether different anaesthetic regimens (intravenous-based or inhalational-based general anaesthesia) affect the postanaesthesia respiratory depression is controversial. Although desflurane has been reported that presents favourable rapid recovery profile in special patients including whom with OSA, the strong clinical evidence of the benefit on postanaesthesia respiratory depression is far from being revealed. This study aims to fill this knowledge gap by investigating the postanaesthesia respiratory depression in postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) in patients with OSA after major abdominal surgery, followed by desflurane-based anaesthesia compared with propofol-based anaesthesia. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Eight hundred and fifty-four patients with OSA scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery will be randomly 1:1 assigned to desflurane-based (n=427) or propofol-based anaesthesia (n=427) using a computer-generated randomisation scheme with permuted block size maintained by a centralised randomisation centre. Patients will be assessed before and a consecutive 3 days after their surgery according to the standardised tasks. Demographic data as well as surgical and anaesthesia information will be collected for the duration of the procedure. Incidence of postanaesthesia respiratory depression in PACU as well as anaesthesia recovery, emergence delirium, postoperative nausea and vomiting, rescue analgesia, duration of PACU and hospital stay, and any other adverse events will be assessed at the given study time point.

2059,1526,rayyan-1270391115,Reprod Health,Evaluating the effectiveness of a combined approach to improve utilization of adolescent sexual reproductive health services in Kenya: a quasi-experimental design study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Access to and utilization of adolescent sexual and reproductive health (ASRH) services remains poor. ASRH services in Kenya are primarily offered in health facilities and include counselling, information, and services on family planning, sexually transmitted infections, and HIV and basic life skills. The Ministry of Education also provides age-appropriate sexual and reproductive health information in schools. This paper presents a study protocol that will evaluate the effectiveness of a combined approach toward improving utilization of ASRH services. METHODS: This will be a quasi-experimental study utilizing qualitative and quantitative methods. During the formative phase, data will be collected through focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and key informant interviews to explore the barriers and facilitators of provision and utilization of ASRH services. A quantitative design will be used to obtain baseline and endline data through household surveys and client exit interviews. Following the formative and baseline household and client exit assessments, an intervention focusing on provision of ASRH service package targeting boys and girls will be implemented for 18 months. The package will include contextualized ASRH services, including counselling and age-appropriate, comprehensive sexual education for behavior change with an aim to increase utilization of ASRH services. An analysis of the primary outcome (utilization of ASRH services) will be undertaken to establish the difference in difference between the control and intervention arm, before the intervention (using the baseline survey data) and after the intervention (using the endline survey data). DISCUSSION: Adolescents have now been included in the World Health Organization's Global strategy for women's, children's and adolescents' health (2016-2030), acknowledging the unique health challenges facing young people and their pivotal role as drivers of change in the post-2015 era. This study will generate evidence on whether a combined school, facility, and community approach works toward improving utilization of ASRH services. The information generated from the study will be beneficial for programming as it will identify underlying reasons for low utilization of ASRH services. Results will help to shape ASRH programs and reduce teenage pregnancy within Kenya and other similar low middle-income countries.

Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin antibiotic with a catechol moiety on the 3-position side chain. Cefiderocol has been shown to be potent in vitro against a broad range of Gram-negative organisms, including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and multi-drug-resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Recent clinical data has shown cefiderocol to be effective in the setting of complicated urinary tract infections and nosocomial pneumonia, but it has not yet been studied as treatment of bloodstream infection. METHODS: This study will use a multicentre, open-label non-inferiority trial design comparing cefiderocol and standard of care antibiotics. Eligible participants will be adult inpatients who are diagnosed with a bloodstream infection with a Gram-negative organism on the basis of a positive blood culture result where the acquisition meets the definition for healthcare-associated or hospital-acquired. It will compare cefiderocol with the current standard of care (SOC) antibiotic regimen according to the patient's treating clinician. Eligible participants will be randomised 1:1 to cefiderocol or SOC and receive 5-14 days of antibiotic therapy. Trial recruitment will occur in at least 20 sites in ten countries (Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Turkey and Greece). The sample size has been derived from an estimated 14 day, all-cause mortality rate of 10% in the control group, and a non-inferiority margin of 10% difference in the two groups. A minimum of 284 patients are required in total to achieve 80% power with a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. Data describing demographic information, risk factors, concomitant antibiotics, illness scores, microbiology, multidrug-resistant organism screening, discharge and mortality will be collected. DISCUSSION: With increasing antimicrobial resistance, there is a need for the development of new antibiotics with broad activity against Gram-negative pathogens such as cefiderocol. By selecting a population at risk for multi-drug-resistant pathogens and commencing study treatment early in the clinical illness (within 48 h of index blood culture) the trial hopes to provide guidance to clinicians of the efficacy of this novel agent.

Treatment practices in PCD are largely extrapolated from more common chronic respiratory disorders, particularly cystic fibrosis, but no randomized controlled trials (RCT) have ever evaluated efficacy and safety of any pharmacotherapeutics used in the treatment of PCD. Maintenance therapy, with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin, is currently widely used in chronic respiratory diseases including PCD. In addition to its antibacterial properties, azithromycin is considered to have beneficial anti-inflammatory and anti-quorum-sensing properties. The aim of this study is to determine the efficacy of azithromycin maintenance therapy for 6 months on respiratory exacerbations in PCD. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of azithromycin on lung function, ventilation inhomogeneity, hearing impairment, and symptoms (respiratory, sinus, ears and hearing) measured on a PCD-specific health-related quality of life instrument, and to assess the safety of azithromycin maintenance therapy in PCD. METHODS: The BESTCILIA trial is a European multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The intervention is tablets of azithromycin 250/500 mg according to body weight or placebo administered three times a week for 6 months. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of PCD, age 7-50 years, are eligible for inclusion. Chronic pulmonary infections with Gram-negative bacteria or any recent occurrence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria are exclusion criteria. The planned number of subjects to be included is 125. The trial has been approved by the Research Ethics Committees of the participating institutions. DISCUSSION: We present a study protocol of an ongoing RCT, evaluating for the first time, the efficacy and safety of a pharmacotherapeutic treatment for patients with PCD. The RCT evaluates azithromycin maintenance therapy, a drug already commonly prescribed in other chronic respiratory disorders. Furthermore, the trial will utilize the Lung clearance index and new, PCD-specific quality of life instruments as outcome measures for PCD. Recruitment is hampered by frequent occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, exacerbations at enrolment, and the patients' perception of disease severity and necessity of additional management and treatment during trial participation.

2063,1530,rayyan-1270387327,Trials,A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial to investigate the effects of nasal calcitonin on bone microarchitecture measured by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography in postmenopausal women - study protocol,"BACKGROUND: Bone microarchitecture is a significant determinant of bone strength. So far, the assessment of bone microarchitecture has required bone biopsies, limiting its utilization in clinical practice to one single skeletal site. With the advance of high-resolution imaging techniques, non-invasive in vivo measurement of bone microarchitecture has recently become possible. This provides an opportunity to efficiently assess the effects of anti-osteoporotic therapies on bone microarchitecture. We therefore designed a protocol to investigate the effects of nasal salmon calcitonin, an inhibitor of osteoclast activity, on bone microarchitecture in postmenopausal women, comparing weight bearing and non-weight bearing skeletal sites. METHODS: One hundred postmenopausal women will be included in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial comparing the effect of nasal salmon calcitonin (200 UI/day) to placebo over two years. Bone microarchitecture at the distal radius and distal tibia will be determined yearly by high-resolution peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (p-QCT) with a voxel size of 82 mum and an irradiation of less than 5 muSv. Serum markers of bone resorption and bone formation will be measured every 6 months. Safety and compliance will be assessed. Primary endpoint is the change in bone microarchitecture; secondary endpoint is the change in markers of bone turnover. HYPOTHESIS: The present study should provide new information on the mode of action of nasal calcitonin. We hypothezise that - compared to placebo - calcitonin impacts on microstructural parameters, with a possible difference between weight bearing and non-weight bearing bones.

But for ultra-low rectal cancer, there is little possibility for organ preservation. Immunotherapy has been shown to have significant survival benefits in microsatellite instability-high patients but poor response in microsatellite stable (MSS) patients. Studies have demonstrated that radiotherapy and immunotherapy have synergistic effects in cancer treatment. There is no existing evidence about the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy combined with nCRT for patients with MSS ultra-low rectal cancer. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: This trial is an open-labelled multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial (NCT05215379) with two parallel groups and allocation ratio 1:1 (nCRT+immunotherapy vs nCRT group). Eligible participants will be aged 18-75 years, with a desire for anus preservation, confirmed cT(1-3a)N(0-1)M(0) rectal adenocarcinoma, confirmed MSS type, inferior margin of ≤5 cm from the anal verge. The primary endpoint of this trial is complete clinical response (cCR) rate. Immunotherapy is added after 1 week of chemoradiotherapy for two cycles, and then the patients will be administered two cycles of immunotherapy and CAPOX. The evaluations will be carried out after the completion of the whole neoadjuvant therapy. We expect the programme to improve the cCR rate and the quality of life for patients with ultra-low rectal cancer. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial was approved by the Ethics committee of Changhai Hospital and other medical centres (Grant number:CHEC2022-118). The results of this study will provide further insight into the clinical efficacy of immunotherapy in combination with nCRT in patients with MSS ultra-low rectal cancer.

The European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism recommends oral nutritional supplements (ONS) as a first-line nutritional therapy to prevent malnutrition in patients with cancer. However, adherence to ONS is unsatisfactory. The overall aim of this study was to evaluate the adherence of patients with gastric cancer to ONS and to explore the promoting and hindering factors. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In this study, we will use mixed methods with an explanatory sequential approach for data collection and analysis. In the first phase, a 12-week longitudinal study will be performed to identify changes in trends of oral nutritional supplementation adherence in 135 patients with gastric cancer, the impact of adherence on nutritional indicators and clinical outcomes and ONS adherence-related factors. The primary endpoints include patient adherence to ONS, weight, body mass index and grip strength followed by 30-day readmission rate, complications and adverse reactions. In the second stage, qualitative research will be implemented to provide in-depth insight into the quantitative results. Finally, quantitative and qualitative results will be combined for analysis and discussion to put forward suggestions for improving patients' ONS adherence. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This research protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the School of Nursing, Jilin University, China (No. 2019101601). Results will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and sent to participating practices. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: ChiTR2000032425.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
2066,1533,rayyan-1270389329,Trials,Fitness and mobility training in patients with Intensive Care Unit-acquired muscle weakness (FITonICU): study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Critical illness myopathy (CIM) and polyneuropathy (CIP) are a common complication of critical illness. Both cause intensive-care-unit-acquired (ICU-acquired) muscle weakness (ICUAW) which increases morbidity and delays rehabilitation and recovery of activities of daily living such as walking ability. Focused physical rehabilitation of people with ICUAW is, therefore, of great importance at both an individual and a societal level. A recent systematic Cochrane review found no randomised controlled trials (RCT), and thus no supporting evidence, for physical rehabilitation interventions for people with defined CIP and CIM to improve activities of daily living. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the effects of an additional physiotherapy programme with systematically augmented levels of mobilisation with additional in-bed cycling (as the parallel group) on walking and other activities of daily living. METHODS/DESIGN: We will conduct a prospective, rater-masked RCT of people with ICUAW with a defined diagnosis of CIM and/or CIP in our post-acute hospital. We will randomly assign patients to one of two parallel groups in a 1:1 ratio and will use a concealed allocation. One intervention group will receive, in addition to standard ICU treatment, physiotherapy with systematically augmented levels of mobilisation (five times per week, over 2 weeks; 20 min each session; with a total of 10 additional sessions). The other intervention group will receive, in addition to standard ICU treatment, in-bed cycle sessions (same number, frequency and treatment time as the intervention group). Standard ICU treatment includes sitting balance exercise, stretching, positioning, and sit-to-stand training, and transfer training to get out of bed, strengthening exercise (in and out of bed), and stepping and assistive standing exercises. Primary efficacy endpoints will be walking ability (defined as a Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) level of ≥3) and the sum score of the Functional Status Score for the Intensive Care Unit (FSS-ICU) (range 0-22 points) assessed by a blinded tester immediately after 2 weeks of additional therapy. Secondary outcomes will include assessment of sit-to-stand recovery, overall limb strength (Medical Research Council, MRC) and grip strength, the Physical Function for the Intensive Care Unit Test-Scored (PFIT-S), the EuroQol 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire and the Reintegration to Normal Living Index (RNL-Index) assessed by a blinded tester. We will measure primary and secondary outcomes with blinded assessors at baseline, immediately after 2 weeks of additional therapy, and at 3 weeks and 6 months and 12 months after the end of the additional therapy intervention. Based on our sample size calculation 108 patients will be recruited from our post-acute ICU in the next 3 to 4 years. DISCUSSION: This will be the first RCT comparing the effects of two physical rehabilitation interventions for people with ICUAW due to defined CIP and/or CIM to improve walking and other activities of daily living. The results of this trial will provide robust evidence for physical rehabilitation of people with CIP and/or CIP who often require long-term care. TRIAL REGISTRATION: We registered the study on 6 April 2016 before enrolling the first patient in the trial at the German Clinical Trials Register ( www.germanctr.de ) with the identifier DRKS00010269 .

Study protocol for a 4-week proof-of-concept intervention,"BACKGROUND: Falls are a major health care concern for our aging population. Previous research has identified impaired sustained attention as a risk factor for falls. Recently, meditation has been shown to improve different types of attention in various populations. However, there are no studies to date examining whether meditation training can improve sustained attention and mobility in older adults. METHODS: We are conducting a 4-week proof-of-concept meditation intervention. We will recruit community-dwelling older adults. Participants will be randomized into one of two groups: (1) meditation training or (2) music listening (control). All participants will complete three 20-min group sessions per week and will be encouraged to continue their practice independently on the remaining days each week. Our primary outcome measure is behavioral performance on the Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART). Our secondary and tertiary outcomes include electroencephalograms (EEG) to assess attention and cognitive processing, mobility, and executive function. DISCUSSION: Our proof-of-concept intervention aims to examine whether meditation training can improve sustained attention in older adults, who are known to be susceptible to falls. Importantly, our research has the potential to inform future clinical trials aimed at improving mobility and reducing falls risk in our aging population.

2068,1535,rayyan-1270391109,BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,The PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM): study protocol for a cluster randomized controlled trial of two active interventions addressing perinatal depression in obstetric settings,"BACKGROUND: Perinatal depression, the most common pregnancy complication, is associated with negative maternal-offspring outcomes. Despite existence of effective treatments, it is under-recognized and under-treated. Professional organizations recommend universal screening, yet multi-level barriers exist to ensuring effective diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up. Integrating mental health and obstetric care holds significant promise for addressing perinatal depression. The overall study goal is to compare the effectiveness of two active interventions: (1) the Massachusetts Child Psychiatry Access Program (MCPAP) for Moms, a state-wide, population-based program, and (2) the PRogram In Support of Moms (PRISM) which includes MCPAP for Moms plus a proactive, multifaceted, practice-level intervention with intensive implementation support. METHODS: This study is conducted in two phases: (1) a run-in phase which has been completed and involved practice and patient participant recruitment to demonstrate feasibility for the second phase, and (2) a cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), which is ongoing, and will compare two active interventions 1:1 with ten Ob/Gyn practices as the unit of randomization. In phase 1, rates of depressive symptoms and other demographic and clinical features among patients were examined to inform practice randomization. Patient participants to be recruited in phase 2 will be followed longitudinally until 13 months postpartum; they will have 3-5 total study visits depending on whether their initial recruitment and interview was at 4-24 or 32-40 weeks gestation, or 1-3 months postpartum. Sampling throughout pregnancy and postpartum will ensure participants with different depressive symptom onset times. Differences in depression symptomatology and treatment participation will be compared between patient participants by intervention arm. DISCUSSION: This manuscript describes the full two-phase study protocol. The study design is innovative because it combines effectiveness with implementation research designs and integrates critical components of participatory action research. Our approach assesses the feasibility, acceptance, efficacy, and sustainability of integrating a stepped-care approach to perinatal depression care into ambulatory obstetric settings; an approach that is flexible and can be tailored and adapted to fit unique workflows of real-world practices.

Perceived lack of control has been found to be detrimental to physical and mental health. There is a lack of evidence-based knowledge elucidating how frail older people in nursing home settings themselves perceive autonomy in daily life. Further, there are no studies on the extent to which this perception can be influenced positively by participating in an individually tailored programme based on residents' own wishes for daily activities. METHODS AND DESIGN: A total of 9 nursing homes and 55 participants aged 65 years or older were included in the study. All the participants were restricted in performing at least one P-ADL activity unassisted and had a Mini Mental State Examination-score above 16. Perceived autonomy was measured at baseline, after 12 weeks and after 24 weeks by The Autonomy Sub-dimension in the Measure of Actualisation of Potential test. Programmes were based on participants' individual assessment of their most important daily activities. Staff at all nursing homes who usually organize physical training, social or creative activities carried out individually tailored programmes using their usual methods and equipment. Participants in each nursing home were divided by lot into either a control group or an intervention group. The control groups received their usual care and treatment. DISCUSSION: This study is designed to assess the status of perceived autonomy at baseline and to provide information about the effectiveness of individually tailored programmes according to perceptions of autonomy registered in institutionalised physically frail older people. This will add knowledge to assist response to present and future challenges in relation to health promotion initiatives for this group.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Brief digital interventions have been shown to improve youth mental health, but little is known about which digital interventions are most effective. AIMS: To evaluate the effectiveness of two digital single-session interventions (Shamiri-Digital and Digital-CBT (cognitive-behavioural therapy)) among Kenyan adolescents. METHODS: We will perform a school-based comparative effectiveness randomised controlled trial. Approximately 926 Kenyan adolescents will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: Shamiri-Digital (focused on gratitude, growth mindsets and values), Digital-CBT (focused on behavioural activation, cognitive restructuring and problem solving) or a study-skills control condition (focused on note-taking and essay writing skills). The primary outcomes include depressive symptoms (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-8), anxiety symptoms (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener-7) and subjective well-being (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Well-being Scale). The secondary outcomes include acceptability, appropriateness, primary control and secondary control. Acceptability and appropriateness will be measured immediately post-intervention; other outcomes will be measured 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 12 weeks post-intervention. RESULTS: We hypothesise that adolescents assigned to Shamiri-Digital and adolescents assigned to Digital-CBT will experience greater improvements (assessed via hierarchical linear models) than those assigned to the control group. We will also compare Shamiri-Digital with Digital-CBT, although we do not have a preplanned hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings will help us evaluate two digital single-session interventions with different theoretical foundations. If effective, such interventions could be disseminated to reduce the public health burden of common mental health problems.

Most problem drinkers will never seek treatment. The current trial will test the efficacy of two Internet interventions for problem drinking - one minimal and the other extended - as an alternate means of providing help to those in need. METHODS/DESIGN: A double blinded, four-wave panel design with random assignment to two experimental conditions will be used in this study. Participants will be recruited through a comprehensive recruitment strategy consisting of online and print advertisements asking for people who are 'interested in helping us develop and evaluate Internet-based interventions for problem drinkers.' Potential participants will be screened to select problem drinkers who have home access to the Internet. Participants will be sent to a password-protected Internet site and, upon signing in, will be randomized to be provided access to the minimal or extended Internet-based intervention. Six-month, twelve-month, and two-year drinking outcomes will be compared between experimental conditions. The primary hypothesis is that participants in the extended Internet intervention condition will display significantly improved drinking outcomes at twelve months compared to participants in the minimal intervention. DISCUSSION: The findings of this trial will contribute to the growing literature on Internet interventions for problem drinkers. In addition, findings from this trial will contribute to the scarce literature available evaluating the long-term efficacy of brief interventions for alcohol problems.

2074,1541,rayyan-1270393264,Trials,Effects of real-time feedback during decline walking on kinematic and kinetic gait parameters in a healthy population: study protocol for a randomized trial - up and down,"BACKGROUND: The control of the dynamic functional leg alignment (dFLA) and biomechanical load are important joint-related aspects regarding the development of osteoarthritis (OA). Research on level walking with feedback on load-related parameters has provided innovative treatment possibilities. With regard to walking on sloped surfaces, fundamental biomechanical knowledge exists. However, comprehensive data on the agreement of kinematics and kinetics of self-paced ramp versus sloped treadmill walking is lacking. Further, deeper insights into the control of the dFLA during decline walking and the usefulness of real-time feedback are missing. METHODS/DESIGN: Thirty healthy participants aged between 18 and 35 years will be included. They will complete a three-dimensional gait analysis walking self-paced up and down on a 5-m ramp with a 10° inclination. Subsequently, speed-matched to ramp-up walking and self-paced 10° incline split-belt treadmill walking will be assessed. Afterwards, the participants will be observed under four different conditions of 10° declined walking on the same treadmill (a) self-paced walking, (b) self-paced walking with an internal focus of attention, (c) self-paced walking with real-time feedback, and (d) condition c speed-matched walking. The primary outcome parameter will be the frontal knee range of motion (fKROM). Secondary outcomes include the ground reaction force loading rate, spatial-temporal parameters, as well as sagittal, frontal and transversal kinematics, and kinetics for the lower extremities. DISCUSSION: The findings aim at improving the understanding of the effects of real-time feedback on the control of the dFLA and lower limb loading. Following clinical practicable methods for effective feedback devices can be developed and evaluated. Additionally, the first dataset comparing kinematic and kinetic parameters for decline and incline ramp walking versus walking on an instrumented treadmill will be available for appropriate intervention planning.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) is one of the most effective medications to reduce the volume of fibroids and the uterus. However, its role in preventing recurrence after conservative surgery remains unclear. At present, there is no randomised clinical trial determining the efficacy of GnRHa treatment for preventing multiple leiomyomas recurrence after myomectomy. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are conducting a phase IV randomised controlled trial in women aged 18-45 undergoing myomectomy for multiple leiomyomas.

Posterior fossa decompression with duraplasty (PFDD) has been widely practiced in Chiari decompression, but dural opening carries a high risk of surgical complications. A minimally invasive technique, dural splitting decompression (DSD), preserves the inner layer of the dura without dural opening and duraplasty, potentially reducing surgical complications, length of operative time and hospital stay, and cost. If DSD is non-inferior to PFDD in terms of clinical improvement, DSD could be an alternative treatment modality for CM-I. So far, no randomised study of surgical treatment of CM-I has been reported. This study aims to evaluate if DSD is an effective, safe and cost-saving treatment modality for adult CM-I patients, and may provide evidence for using the minimally invasive procedure extensively. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: DECMI is a randomised controlled, single-masked, non-inferiority, single centre clinical trial. Participants meeting the criteria will be randomised to the DSD group and the PFDD group in a 1:1 ratio. The primary outcome is the rate of clinical improvement, which is defined as the complete resolution or partial improvement of the presenting symptoms/signs.

In 2005, the mean cost for a CABG procedure among Medicare beneficiaries in the USA was $32, 201 ± $23,059. The same operation reportedly costs less than $2000 to produce in India. The goals of the proposed study are to (1) identify the difference in the costs incurred to perform CABG surgery by three Joint Commission accredited hospitals with reputations for high quality and efficiency and (2) characterise the opportunity to reduce the cost of performing CABG surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We use time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) to quantify the hospitals' costs of producing elective, multivessel CABG. TDABC estimates the costs of a given clinical service by combining information about the process of patient care delivery (specifically, the time and quantity of labour and non-labour resources utilised to perform each activity) with the unit cost of each resource used to provide the care. Resource utilisation was estimated by constructing CABG process maps for each site based on observation of care and staff interviews. Unit costs were calculated as a capacity cost rate, measured as a $/min, for each resource consumed in CABG production. Multiplying together the unit costs and resource quantities and summing across all resources used will produce the average cost of CABG production at each site. We will conclude by conducting a variance analysis of labour costs to reveal opportunities to bend the cost curve for CABG production in the USA. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: All our methods were exempted from review by the Stanford Institutional Review Board. Results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0

Excess mortality and hospitalisation have been associated with hyperkalaemia (HK) after the long (2-day) interdialytic interval (LIDI) in patients on thrice a week HD compared with the short (1-day) interdialytic interval. Moreover, not much research has been conducted in China on the descriptive epidemiology and management of HK among different HD centres. The aim of this study is to address this evidence gap by investigating the risk factors associated with HK clinical burden at the HD facility level, current HD centres management patterns, serum potassium management patterns, as well as the risk factors associated with crude mortality in China. DESIGN: Multicentre, observational, retrospective cohort study. SETTING: This study plans to enrol 300 HD centres across China. Haemodialysis centres having ≥100 patients on maintenance HD within 3 years before study initiation, with participation willingness, routine blood collection post-LIDI and death records will be included. PARTICIPANTS: Patients aged ≥18 years and on chronic HD for ≥3 months will be considered eligible. Summary data about serum potassium, characteristics of patients, facility practice patterns will be collected at HD facility level and death records will be at the patient level. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome will be to examine the association between suspected risk factors and HK prevalence at HD facility level. Suspected risk factors include dialysis prescriptions and serum potassium testing frequency, characteristics of patients and related medication usage. The secondary outcome will be to determine the HK prevalence, serum potassium management pattern and risk factors associated with crude mortality. The primary and secondary outcomes will be analysed using regression models. Exploratory outcomes will further investigate the risk factors associated with serum potassium ≥6.0 and ≥6.5 mmol/L.

However, genetic contingency theory predicts that genetic attributions will lead to an increased desire for social distance only from persons with disorders who are perceived as dangerous. PURPOSE: To assess the interactive effect of diagnosis and attribution on social distance and actual helping decisions across disorders. METHODS: Undergraduate students (n = 149) were randomly assigned to read one of the six vignettes depicting a person affected by one of the three disorders (i.e., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression) with either a genetic or environmental causal attribution for disorder. Participants completed measures of perceived dangerousness, social distance, empathic concern, familiarity with mental illness, and actual helping decisions. RESULTS: When provided with genetic attributions, participants' desire for social distance was greater for targets with schizophrenia relative to targets with depression or bipolar disorder. This effect was mediated by perceived dangerousness. The indirect effect of diagnosis on helping decisions, through social distance, was significant within the genetic attribution condition. CONCLUSION: Consistent with genetic contingency theory, genetic attributions for schizophrenia, but not affective disorders, lead to greater desire for social distance via greater perceived dangerousness. Further, results suggest that genetic attributions decrease the likelihood of helping people with schizophrenia, but have no effect on the likelihood of helping people with affective disorders. These effects are partially accounted for by desired social distance from people with schizophrenia.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

The aim of this initial methodological study was to develop a plasma input tracer kinetic model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 binding in healthy subjects and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and to provide a preliminary assessment whether there is a disease-related signal. Ten AD patients and six healthy subjects underwent a dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) study along with arterial sampling and a scan protocol of 150 minutes after administration of 250 ± 10 MBq [(18)F]DPA-714. The model that provided the best fits to tissue time activity curves (TACs) was selected based on Akaike Information Criterion and F-test. The reversible two tissue compartment plasma input model with blood volume parameter was the preferred model for quantification of [(18)F]DPA-714 kinetics, irrespective of scan duration, volume of interest, and underlying volume of distribution (VT). Simplified reference tissue model (SRTM)-derived binding potential (BPND) using cerebellar gray matter as reference tissue correlated well with plasma input-based distribution volume ratio (DVR). These data suggest that [(18)F]DPA-714 cannot be used for separating individual AD patients from healthy subjects, but further studies including TSPO binding status are needed to substantiate these findings.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2086,1553,rayyan-1277751880,Depress Anxiety,Longitudinal study of the influence of life events and personality status on diagnostic change in three neurotic disorders,"It has been known for many years that diagnosis within the neurotic spectrum of disorders is temporally unstable and also that life events can be major precipitants of change in symptoms. Reasons for this instability could include inherent inadequacy of current diagnostic practice, the influence of life events as an agent of diagnostic shift, and an innate course of disorder with features dependent on the stage at which disorder presents (e.g., development of panic to agoraphobia). These possibilities were examined in a prospective study that was initially a randomised controlled trial. Two hundred ten patients recruited from primary care psychiatric clinics with DSM-III diagnosed dysthymic, generalised anxiety, and panic disorders were randomly allocated to either drug treatment (mainly antidepressants), cognitive-behaviour therapy, or self-help therapy over a 2 year period, irrespective of original diagnosis. Life events were recorded by using a standard procedure over the period 6 months before starting treatment and at five occasions over 2 years; 181 (86%) of the patients had follow-up data and 76% maintained compliance with the original treatment allocated over the 2 years; and 155 of the 181 patients (86%) had at least one diagnostic change in this period. There was no difference in the number of diagnostic changes between the three original diagnostic groups, but dysthymic disorder changed more frequently to major depressive episode than did GAD or panic disorder (20; 11; 12) (%) and panic disorder changed more frequently to agoraphobia (with or without panic) than did dysthymia or GAD (18; 8; 6) (%). There was no relationship between loss events and depressive diagnoses or between addition events and anxiety diagnoses, but greater numbers of conflict events were associated with diagnostic change. More life events were associated with the flamboyant and dependent personality disorders, reinforcing other evidence that many life events are internally generated by personality characteristics and cannot be regarded as truly independent.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

A controlled trial,"This study reports the efficacy of the General Health Questionnaire (G.H.Q.) in the secondary prevention of minor psychiatric illness in a primary-care setting. 1093 consecutive attenders at a general practitioner's surgery were screened for minor psychiatric disorder using the G.H.Q. 32% were found to have a conspicuous psychiatric disorder and a further 11% had a hidden psychiatric disorder. The group with hidden disorders were randomly assigned to a treated index group and an untreated control group. The effects of case detection and treatment were beneficial and immediate, with the duration of episode of the disorder being much shorter for patients whose disorder was recognised by the general practitioner. For patients with more severe disorders there are significant differences still demonstrable between the groups one year later; but patients with mild disorders do equally well, some recovering spontaneously but others becoming manifest to the general practitioner over the next year and so receiving treatment. The ""detected"" group of patients increased their consultations for emotional complaints over the next year, but their total consultation-rate was not increased.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2096,1563,rayyan-1277754369,Eur J Neurol,Caudate atrophy on MRI is a characteristic feature of FTLD-FUS,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) can be subdivided into those in which the abnormal protein is tau (FTLD-TAU), the TAR DNA binding protein 43 (FTLD-TDP) and the fused in sarcoma protein (FTLD-FUS). We have observed severe caudate atrophy at autopsy in FTLD-FUS, and hence, we aimed to determine whether caudate atrophy on MRI is a feature that can distinguish FTLD-FUS from FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU. METHODS: From a cohort of 207 cases of FTLD, we identified all cases of FTLD-FUS that had a volumetric antemortem head MRI (n = 3). Caudate and frontal lobe volumes were measured in all three cases using atlas-based parcellation and SPM5 and were compared to 10 randomly selected cases of FTLD-TDP and 10 randomly selected cases of FTLD-TAU. Total grey matter volumes were also calculated for all cases. RESULTS: The FTLD-FUS cases had significantly smaller caudate volumes (P = 0.02) yet similar frontal lobe grey matter volumes (P = 0.12) compared to FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU. Caudate volumes when corrected for total grey matter volume (P = 0.01) or frontal lobe grey matter volume (P = 0.01) were significantly smaller in FTLD-FUS than in FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU and showed no overlap with the other two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Caudate atrophy on MRI appears to be significantly greater in FTLD-FUS compared with FTLD-TDP and FTLD-TAU, suggesting that severe caudate atrophy may be a useful clinical feature to predict FTLD-FUS pathology.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2097,1564,rayyan-1277753250,J Gen Intern Med,Prevalence of depression-PTSD comorbidity: implications for clinical practice guidelines and primary care-based interventions,"BACKGROUND: Compared to those with depression alone, depressed patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) experience more severe psychiatric symptomatology and factors that complicate treatment. OBJECTIVE: To estimate PTSD prevalence among depressed military veteran primary care patients and compare demographic/illness characteristics of PTSD screen-positive depressed patients (MDD-PTSD+) to those with depression alone (MDD). DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of MDD patients versus MDD-PTSD+ patients. PARTICIPANTS: Six hundred seventy-seven randomly sampled depressed patients with at least 1 primary care visit in the previous 12 months. Participants composed the baseline sample of a group randomized trial of collaborative care for depression in 10 VA primary care practices in 5 states. MEASUREMENTS: The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 assessed MDD. Probable PTSD was defined as a Primary Care PTSD Screen > or = 3. Regression-based techniques compared MDD and MDD-PTSD+ patients on demographic/illness characteristics. RESULTS: Thirty-six percent of depressed patients screened positive for PTSD. Adjusting for sociodemographic differences and physical illness comorbidity, MDD-PTSD+ patients reported more severe depression (P < .001), lower social support (P < .001), more frequent outpatient health care visits (P < .001), and were more likely to report suicidal ideation (P < .001) than MDD patients. No differences were observed in alcohol consumption, self-reported general health, and physical illness comorbidity. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD is more common among depressed primary care patients than previously thought. Comorbid PTSD among depressed patients is associated with increased illness burden, poorer prognosis, and delayed response to depression treatment. Providers should consider recommending psychotherapeutic interventions for depressed patients with PTSD.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2098,1565,rayyan-1277755872,Brain,"Pyramidal neurons of the prefrontal cortex in post-stroke, vascular and other ageing-related dementias","Dementia associated with cerebrovascular disease is common. It has been reported that ∼30% of elderly patients who survive stroke develop delayed dementia (post-stroke dementia), with most cases being diagnosed as vascular dementia. The pathological substrates associated with post-stroke or vascular dementia are poorly understood, particularly those associated with executive dysfunction. Three separate yet interconnecting circuits control executive function within the frontal lobe involving the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and the orbitofrontal cortex. We used stereological methods, along with immunohistological and related cell morphometric analysis, to examine densities and volumes of pyramidal neurons of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex in the frontal lobe from a total of 90 elderly subjects (age range 71-98 years). Post-mortem brain tissues from post-stroke dementia and post-stroke patients with no dementia were derived from our prospective Cognitive Function After Stroke study. We also examined, in parallel, samples from ageing controls and similar age subjects pathologically diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease, mixed Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, and vascular dementia. We found pyramidal cell volumes in layers III and V in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of post-stroke and vascular dementia and, of mixed and Alzheimer's disease subjects to be reduced by 30-40% compared to post-stroke patients with no dementia and controls. There were no significant changes in neuronal volumes in either the anterior cingulate or orbitofrontal cortices. Remarkably, pyramidal neurons within the orbitofrontal cortex were also found to be smaller in size when compared to those in the other two neocortical regions. To relate the cell changes to cognitive function, we noted significant correlations between neuronal volumes and total CAMCOG, orientation and memory scores and clinical dementia ratings. Total estimated neuronal densities were not significantly changed between patients with post-stroke dementia and post-stroke patients with no dementia groups or ageing controls in any of the three frontal regions. In further morphometric analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, we showed that neither diffuse cerebral atrophy nor neocortical thickness explained the selective neuronal volume effects. We also noted that neurofilament protein SMI31 immunoreactivity was increased in post-stroke and vascular dementia compared with post-stroke patients with no dementia and correlated with decreased neuronal volumes in subjects with post-stroke dementia and vascular dementia. Our findings suggest selective regional pyramidal cell atrophy in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-rather than neuronal density changes per se-are associated with dementia and executive dysfunction in post-stroke dementia and vascular dementia. The changes in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex pyramidal cells were not associated with neurofibrillary pathology suggesting there is a vascular basis for the observed highly selective neuronal atrophy.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

Three-dimensional MRI was used for PVC. We randomly divided the subjects into two groups. The first group, comprising 30 patients and 30 healthy volunteers, was used to identify the brain area with the most significant decrease in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in patients compared with normal controls based on the voxel-based analysis of a group comparison. The second group, comprising 31 patients and 31 healthy volunteers, was used to study the improvement in diagnostic accuracy provided by PVC. A Z score map for a SPECT image of a subject was obtained by comparison with mean and standard deviation SPECT images of the healthy volunteers for each voxel after anatomical standardization and voxel normalization to global mean or cerebellar values using the following equation: Z score = ([control mean]-[individual value] )/(control SD). Analysis of receiver operating characteristics curves for a Z score discriminating AD and controls in the posterior cingulate gyrus, where a significant decrease in rCBF was identified in the first group, showed that the PVC significantly enhanced the accuracy of the SPECT diagnosis of very early AD from 73.9% to 83.7% with global mean normalization. The PVC mildly enhanced the accuracy from 73.1% to 76.3% with cerebellar normalization. This result suggests that early diagnosis of AD requires PVC in a SPECT study.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

At entry into the study, of 105 patients categorized as active alcoholics, 84 (80%) obtained a positive score on the mSAAST. Of 77 patients initially identified as being at risk for developing alcoholism (potential alcoholics) by mSAAST scores, 31 (40%) subsequently developed characteristics of excessive alcohol consumption. Of the 321 patients classified as nonalcoholic by history as well as mSAAST score, a significantly lesser proportion (15%) developed characteristics of excessive alcohol consumption (p less than 0.001). These findings suggest the mSAAST to be a useful adjunctive indicator of persons at risk of developing excessive consumption of alcohol. It is probable that the usefulness of the mSAAST extends beyond narcotic-dependent populations and may be of value in identifying the potential for excessive alcohol consumption in other populations.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2104,1571,rayyan-1277760128,Sci Rep,"An exploratory metabolomic comparison of participants with fast or absent functional progression from 2CARE, a randomized, double-blind clinical trial in Huntington's disease","Huntington's disease (HD) is increasingly recognized for diverse pathology outside of the nervous system. To describe the biology of HD in relation to functional progression, we previously analyzed the plasma and CSF metabolome in a cross-sectional study of participants who had various degrees of functional impairment. Here, we carried out an exploratory study in plasma from HD individuals over a 3-year time frame to assess whether differences exist between those with fast or absent clinical progression. There were more differences in circulating metabolite levels for fast progressors compared to absent progressors (111 vs 20, nominal p < 0.05). All metabolite changes in faster progressors were decreases, whereas some metabolite concentrations increased in absent progressors. Many of the metabolite levels that decreased in the fast progressors were higher at Screening compared to absent progressors but ended up lower by Year 3. Changes in faster progression suggest greater oxidative stress and inflammation (kynurenine, diacylglycerides, cysteine), disturbances in nitric oxide and urea metabolism (arginine, citrulline, ornithine, GABR), lower polyamines (putrescine and spermine), elevated glucose, and deficient AMPK signaling. Metabolomic differences between fast and absent progressors suggest the possibility of predicting functional decline in HD, and possibly delaying it with interventions to augment arginine, polyamines, and glucose regulation.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2105,1572,rayyan-1277753919,Brain Inj,Sensitivity and specificity of the 3-item memory test in the assessment of post traumatic amnesia,"PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To investigate how the type of stimulus (pictures or words) and the method of reproduction (free recall or recognition after a short or a long delay) affect the sensitivity and specificity of a 3-item memory test in the assessment of post traumatic amnesia (PTA). METHODS: Daily testing was performed in 64 consecutively admitted traumatic brain injured patients, 22 orthopedically injured patients and 26 healthy controls until criteria for resolution of PTA were reached. Subjects were randomly assigned to a test with visual or verbal stimuli. Short delay reproduction was tested after an interval of 3-5 minutes, long delay reproduction was tested after 24 hours. Sensitivity and specificity were calculated over the first 4 test days. RESULTS: The 3-word test showed higher sensitivity than the 3-picture test, while specificity of the two tests was equally high. Free recall was a more effortful task than recognition for both patients and controls. In patients, a longer delay between registration and recall resulted in a significant decrease in the number of items reproduced. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of PTA is best assessed with a memory test that incorporates the free recall of words after a long delay.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2106,1573,rayyan-1277758418,Behav Cogn Psychother,I am a total failure: associations between beliefs and anxiety and depression in patients with inflammatory bowel disease with poor mental quality of life,"BACKGROUND: According to cognitive behavioural theory, cognitive factors (i.e. underlying general dysfunctional beliefs and (situation) specific illness beliefs) are theorized to lead to outcomes like anxiety and depression. In clinical practice, general dysfunctional beliefs are generally not tackled directly in short-term-therapy. AIMS: The goal of the present study was to investigate the associations of general versus specific illness beliefs on anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychiatric disorders among a subgroup of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) with poor mental quality of life (QoL). METHOD: This study concerns cross-sectional data, collected at baseline from a randomized clinical trial. One hundred and eighteen patients, recruited at four Dutch hospitals, with poor QoL (score ≤23 on the mental health subscale of the Short-Form 36-item Health-Survey; SF-36) were included. General dysfunctional beliefs were measured by the Dysfunctional Attitude Scale (DAS), specific illness beliefs by the Illness Perceptions Questionnaire-Revised (IPQ-R), anxiety and depressive symptoms by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and psychiatric disorders by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis-I Disorders (SCID-I). RESULTS: Univariate analyses showed associations between the level of anxiety and/or depression and general dysfunctional beliefs and four specific illness beliefs (consequences, personal control, emotional representations and treatment control). Among patients with IBD with psychiatric disorders, only the DAS was significantly associated with anxiety and depression (DAS added to IPQ-R and IPQ-R added to DAS). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological interventions may have to target general dysfunctional beliefs of patients with IBD with co-morbid psychiatric disorders to be effective. These patients with IBD are especially in need of psychological treatment.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2107,1574,rayyan-1277759898,JAMA Psychiatry,Effect of Technology-Enhanced Screening in Addition to Standard Targeted Clinician Education on the Duration of Untreated Psychosis: A Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial,"IMPORTANCE: Reducing the duration of untreated psychosis (DUP) is essential to improving outcomes for people with first-episode psychosis (FEP). Current US approaches are insufficient to reduce DUP to international standards of less than 90 days. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether population-based electronic screening in addition to standard targeted clinician education increases early detection of psychosis and decreases DUP, compared with clinician education alone. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cluster randomized clinical trial included individuals aged 12 to 30 years presenting for services between March 2015 and September 2017 at participating sites that included community mental health clinics and school support and special education services. Eligible participants were referred to the Early Diagnosis and Preventative Treatment (EDAPT) Clinic. Data analyses were performed in September and October 2019 for the primary and secondary analyses, with the exploratory subgroup analyses completed in May 2021. INTERVENTIONS: All sites in both groups received targeted education about early psychosis for health care professionals. In the active screening group, clients also completed the Prodromal Questionnaire-Brief using tablets at intake; referrals were based on those scores and clinical judgment. In the group receiving treatment as usual (TAU), referrals were based on clinical judgment alone. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included DUP, defined as the period from full psychosis onset to the date of the EDAPT diagnostic telephone interview, and the number of individuals identified with FEP or a psychosis spectrum disorder. Exploratory analyses examined differences by site type, completion rates between conditions, and days from service entry to telephone interview. RESULTS: Twenty-four sites agreed to participate, and 12 sites were randomized to either the active screening or TAU group. However, only 10 community clinics and 4 school sites were able to fully implement population screening and were included in the final analysis. The total potentially eligible population size within each study group was similar, with 2432 individuals entering at active screening group sites and 2455 at TAU group sites. A total of 303 diagnostic telephone interviews were completed (178 [58.7%] female individuals; mean [SD] age, 17.09 years [4.57]). Active screening sites reported a significantly higher detection rate of psychosis spectrum disorders (136 cases [5.6%], relative to 65 [2.6%]; P < .001) and referred a higher proportion of individuals with FEP and DUP less than 90 days (13 cases, relative to 4; odds ratio, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.10-0.93; P = .03). There was no difference in mean (SD) DUP between groups (active screening group, 239.0 days [207.4]; TAU group 262.3 days [170.2]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cluster trial, population-based technology-enhanced screening across community settings detected more than twice as many individuals with psychosis spectrum disorders compared with clinical judgment alone but did not reduce DUP. Screening could identify people undetected in US mental health services. Significant DUP reduction may require interventions to reduce time to the first mental health contact.

Recent changes in the law reinforce the need for robust and reproducible methods of assessing capacity when recruiting people for research. AIMS: To identify numbers of capacitous participants in a pragmatic randomised trial of dementia treatment; to assess characteristics associated with capacity; to describe a legally acceptable consent process for research. METHODS: As part of a pragmatic randomised controlled trial of Ginkgo biloba for mild-moderate dementia, we used a consenting algorithm that met the requirements of existing case law and the exigencies of the new Mental Capacity Act. We decided who had capacity to give informed consent for participation in the trial using this algorithm and sought predictors of capacity. RESULTS: Most participants (76%) with mild-moderate dementia in this trial were unable to give informed consent according to the legal criteria. When adjusted for confounding, the Mini Mental State examination did not predict the presence of capacity. CONCLUSION: Cognitive testing alone is insufficient to assess the presence of capacity. Researchers and clinicians need to be aware of the challenging processes regarding capacity assessment. We outline a procedure which we believe meets the ethical and legal requirements.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

AIMS: To investigate whether performing a (123)I-ioflupane injection ((123)I-FP-CIT also called DaTSCAN™) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scan in patients with possible DLB would lead to a more certain diagnosis (probable DLB or non-DLB dementia). METHOD: We randomised 187 patients with possible DLB 2:1 to have a scan or not (control group). The outcome measure was a change in diagnosis to probable DLB or non-DLB. RESULTS: There were 56 controls and 114 scanned patients, of whom 43% had an abnormal scan. More patients in the imaging group had a change in diagnosis compared with controls at 8 and 24 weeks (61% (n = 70) v. 4% (n = 2) and 71% (n = 77) v. 16% (n = 9); both P<0.0001).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard transaxial section displays and 3D-SSP z-score maps obtained after administration of Tc-99m ECD or I-123 IMP were randomly interpreted in 315 patients who visited initially to the cognitive disorder clinic (age 46-88 years; 162 women, 153 men). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients were clinically diagnosed with Alzheimer disease and 178 patients were diagnosed with other disorders and age-associated cognitive decline. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy calculated using standard transaxial display were 61%, 70%, 61%, 70%, and 66%, respectively, and using the 3D-SSP z-score map were 90%, 74%, 73%, 90%, and 81%, respectively. Particularly, the sensitivity value improved in mild cases compared with severe cases using 3D-SSP. Diagnostic performance with 3D-SSP was superior in both mild dementia (Az = 0.64 [section] vs 0.81 [3D-SSP], P = 0.001) and severe dementia (Az = 0.75 [section] vs 0.90 [3D-SSP], P = 0.002).

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Cross-over clinical trial with depression or anxiety conducted in an office setting. Following randomization to the prayer intervention or control groups, subjects (95% women) completed Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety, Life Orientation Test, Daily Spiritual Experiences Scale, and underwent measurement of cortisol levels. Individuals in the direct person-to-person prayer contact intervention group received six weekly 1-hour prayer sessions while those in the control group received none. Rating scales and cortisol levels were repeated for both groups after completion of the prayer sessions, and a month later. ANOVAs were used to compare pre- and post-prayer measures for each group. RESULTS: At the completion of the trial, participants receiving the prayer intervention showed significant improvement of depression and anxiety, as well as increases of daily spiritual experiences and optimism compared to controls (p < 0.01 in all cases). Subjects in the prayer group maintained these significant improvements (p < 0.01 in all cases) for a duration of at least 1 month after the final prayer session. Participants in the control group did not show significant changes during the study.

Sixty-five subjects randomly assigned to treatment group were tested at baseline and end of treatment. Subjects' mean Mini-Mental State Examination score was 10.83; mean age was 87. Treatment was given for 30 minutes three times a week for 16 weeks. Subjects in the assisted walking group declined 20.9% in functional mobility; the conversation group declined 18.8%. The combined walking and conversation treatment group declined only 2.5%. These differences in outcome were significant and appear to have been affected by differences in treatment fidelity. Subjects in the conversation treatment group completed 90% of intended treatment compared with 75% in the combined group and only 57% in the assisted walking group. Failure to treat was due to subject refusal and physical illness. The conversation component of the combined walking and conversation treatment intervention appears to have improved compliance with the intervention, thereby improving treatment outcome. Results indicate that assisted walking with conversation can contribute to maintenance of functional mobility in institutionalized populations with Alzheimer disease.

METHODS: Cluster-randomized open-label controlled design. 110 residents were randomized by nursing home into three conditions: mahjong, Tai Chi, and simple handicrafts (control). Activities were conducted three times a week for 12 weeks. Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) was taken at 0 (baseline), 3 (post-treatment), 6, and 9 months. The outcome measure was CDR sum-of-box, which is a composite measure of both cognitive and functional deterioration in dementia. RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses were performed using multilevel regression models. Apolipoprotein E ε4 allele and education were included as covariates. Neither treatments had effects on the cognitive and functional components of the CDR, but mahjong had a significant interaction with time on the CDR sum-of-box total, suggesting a slower rate of global deterioration in the mahjong group as compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Mahjong led to a gradual improvement in global functioning and a slightly slower rate of dementia progression over time. The effect was generalized and was not specific to cognition or daily functioning.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

During the following year, half of the former were placed in community settings while nearly all of the latter remained in the hospital. Neither the physical health, level of self-care, or psychiatric condition ratings of the two groups changed differentially over that time. However, the mean Morale Inventory score of the outplacement sample improved while that of the in-patient group remained static. Additional analyses were run between three groups - outplacement planning subjects who were released, those who were not released, and inpatient planning men who were not released. These results confirmed those of the first analyses; the only significant difference appeared on the Morale Inventory, the patients who left showing more improvement than the other two groups. The results argue for an increased emphasis on outplacement programs among geriatric patients.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

METHODS: Sixty patients with schizophrenia were randomly assigned to 16-weeks of Outdoor Cycling (OC) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 38.7 ± 10.1) or Occupational Therapy (OT) (n = 30, 50% male; mean age, 39.0 ± 8.6). OC and OT involved one 90-min group session per week. OC consisted of structured exercise programs and OT addressed daily living skills. Primary outcome measurements were mental health variables, such as Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Beck's Depression Inventory, State and Trait Anxiety Inventory, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Global Assessment of Functioning and executive function (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, WCST). Secondary measures were the adherence and PA. PA was measured by responding to the Physical Activity Scale (K-PASE) and wearing a pedometer for 2 days. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA revealed improved psychotic symptoms (p = .014), depression (p = .007), state (p = .031) and trait anxiety (p = .002) and global functions (p = .024) in the OC group compared with OT group. The OC group showed increased correct rates (p = .022) and categories completed (p = .033) in the WCST. There was no difference in total K-PASE score between groups; however, there was a significant improvement in the number of daily steps in the OC group compared with the OT group (p = .030). CONCLUSION: OC significantly improved mental health and executive function in individuals with schizophrenia. Further, OC significantly increased PA measured by the pedometers. These findings suggest that OC offers a safe and attrition-lowering intervention promoting mental health and PA.

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the intervention and to examine the effectiveness of the implementation strategies in promoting home-based adoption. METHODS: This was a cluster randomized controlled trial adopting a clinical effectiveness-implementation hybrid design. The 12-week music-with-movement intervention aims to promote the well-being of people with dementia and their caregivers. Clinical outcomes were assessed to evaluate the efficacy of the intervention. These included the symptoms of anxiety and depression of people with dementia; caregivers' perception of their stress and the positive aspects of caregiving; and the quality of the dyadic relationship. Caregivers, staff, and volunteers were interviewed and objective figures on reach and adoption were collected to reflect the outcomes of the implementation. RESULTS: Compared to the waitlist control, there was a significant reduction in the anxiety and the symptoms of depression of those in the intervention group. There was also a significant reduction in the perceived stress level of the caregivers. Six focus group interviews were conducted. The intervention and the appropriateness of the implementation strategies were perceived positively by the dyad participants, the staff of the centres, and volunteers. Of the collaborating centres, 57% continued to use the intervention and, after six months, served six times more people than were recruited in this study. Over half of the participating families continued to use the intervention for at least six more months. CONCLUSION: Music-with-movement interventions showed promise for improving the well-being of people with dementia and their caregivers. Effective strategies facilitated the implementation process, such as integrating communication technology to provide instant support and involving volunteers in engaging the collaborating centres and families. This study sheds light on perceptions of the intervention, and on its scalability for a broader population.

This study compares these approaches. In community treatment centers, 142 cocaine- or heroin-dependent outpatients were randomly assigned to standard treatment (ST), ST with vouchers, or ST with prizes for 12 weeks. CM patients remained in treatment longer and achieved greater durations of objectively confirmed abstinence than did ST patients; CM conditions did not differ significantly. Although abstinence at 6- and 9-month follow-ups did not differ by group, the best predictor of abstinence was longest duration of abstinence achieved during treatment. Thus, prize and voucher CM systems are equally efficacious in promoting long durations of abstinence, which in turn are associated with benefits posttreatment.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

OBJECTIVE: The objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of the cognitive rehabilitation program ""GRADIOR"" in people with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. METHOD: This study was a single-blind multicenter randomized clinical trial. Participants were recruited from hospitals/day centers. The experimental group (EG) and control group (CG) received computer-based cognitive training (CCT) and routine daily care, respectively. Outcome measures at T0: baseline, T1: at 4 months, T2: at 12 months were compared within and between-groups. RESULTS: Significant differences or important effect sizes were detected at the intragroup and intergroup level for most variables, observing a trend of improvement and/or maintenance at 4 months by Visual Reasoning of Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), Digit and Arithmetic of WAIS-III, Semantic Verbal Fluency, Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), Trail Making Test (TMT)-A-Mistakes and at 12 months by Visual Reasoning of CAMCOG, Digit Symbol of WAIS-III, TMT-B-mistakes, Visual Memory of Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test, Lexical Verbal Fluency-P, Yesavage's Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), TMT-A-time scales whose objective was to evaluate some executive functions and/or the memory.

2203,89,rayyan-1277754934,Brain Stimul,A randomized controlled trial of sequentially bilateral prefrontal cortex repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia,"BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been investigated for its treatment efficacy for the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Previous studies have targeted the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), which is associated with the pathophysiology of this disorder. Several rTMS parameters have been explored in the treatment of negative symptoms and include stimulating the left and bilateral DLPFC at several different frequencies and number of sessions. Results of such studies have been inconsistent, while high-frequency rTMS has shown greatest promise. OBJECTIVE/HYPOTHESIS: The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of bilateral high-frequency rTMS in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. It was hypothesized rTMS would alleviate negative symptoms in schizophrenia. METHODS: Twenty-five patients were enrolled in this double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial. Bilateral 20 Hz rTMS was MRI-targeted to the DLPFC at 90% RMT administered daily for 4 weeks for a total of 20 treatments. Negative symptoms were assessed with the Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS), the Positive and Negative symptom scale (PANSS), and controlling for depression as measured with the Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) at baseline, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 2 weeks after the treatment course. RESULTS: No significant group or time differences were found on negative symptoms or depressive symptoms after rTMS. Bilateral high-frequency rTMS did not alleviate negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.

2204,90,rayyan-1277756081,Trials,Self-management in early-stage dementia: a pilot randomised controlled trial of the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a self-management group intervention (the SMART study),"BACKGROUND: The possibility of living well with a long-term condition has been identified as centrally relevant to the needs of people living with dementia. Growing numbers of people with early-stage dementia are contributing accounts that emphasise the benefits of actively engaging in managing the condition. Self-management interventions share the common objectives of educating about the condition, optimising well-being, enhancing control over the situation and enabling people to take more responsibility for managing the condition. Benefits of such an approach can include improved knowledge, self-efficacy, health status, and better performance of self-management behaviours. However, there is only preliminary evidence that people with early-stage dementia can benefit from such interventions. METHODS: This feasibility study involves the development of a self-management group intervention for people with early-stage Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia or mixed Alzheimer's and vascular dementia. This study is a single-site pilot randomised-controlled trial. Forty-two people with early stage dementia, each with a caregiver (family member/friend), will be randomised to either the self-management group intervention or to treatment as usual.The self-management group intervention will involve eight weekly sessions, each lasting 90 minutes, held at a memory clinic in North Wales. All participants will be re-assessed three and six months post-randomisation. This study is intended to supply an early evaluation of the self-management intervention so that a full scale trial may be powered from the best available evidence. It will assess the feasibility of the intervention, the study design and the recruitment strategies. It will estimate the parameters and confidence intervals for the research questions of interest. The primary outcome of interest is the self-efficacy score of the person with dementia at three months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for the person with dementia are self-efficacy at six months post-randomisation and cognitive ability, mood and well-being at three and six months post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes for caregivers are their distress and stress at three and six months post-randomisation. The cost-effectiveness of the intervention will also be examined. DISCUSSION: This study will provide preliminary information about the feasibility, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a self-management group intervention for people in the early stages of dementia.

METHOD: Thirty-seven adolescents meeting DSM-III-R criteria for anorexia nervosa were randomly assigned to receive BFST or EOIT, in addition to a common medical and dietary regimen. In BFST, the family was seen conjointly, the parents were placed in control of the adolescent's eating, distorted beliefs were targeted through cognitive restructuring, and strategic/behavioral interventions were used to change family interactions. In EOIT, the adolescent was seen individually, with an emphasis on building ego strength and uncovering the dynamics blocking eating; parents were seen collaterally. Measures administered before, after, and at 1-year follow-up tapped body mass index, menstruation, eating attitudes, ego functioning, depression, and family interactions. RESULTS: BFST produced greater weight gain and higher rates of resumption of menstruation than EOIT. Both treatments produced comparably large improvements in eating attitudes, depression, and eating-related family conflict, but very few changes occurred on ego functioning. CONCLUSIONS: BFST and EOIT proved to be effective treatments for adolescents with anorexia nervosa, but BFST produced a faster return to health.",Human-RCT-non-drug-intervention,9,0

In this study, midbrain organoids were yielded from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) to prepare cells for Parkinson's disease (PD) therapy. Neural stem/precursor cells (NSCs) isolated from midbrain organoids (Og-NSCs) expanded stably and differentiated into midbrain-type dopamine(mDA) neurons, and an unprecedentedly high proportion expressed midbrain-specific factors, with relatively low cell line and batch-to-batch variations. Single cell transcriptome analysis followed by in vitro assays indicated that the majority of cells in the Og-NSC cultures are ventral midbrain (VM)-patterned with low levels of cellular senescence/aging and mitochondrial stress, compared to those derived from 2D-culture environments. Notably, in contrast to current methods yielding mDA neurons without astrocyte differentiation, mDA neurons that differentiated from Og-NSCs were interspersed with astrocytes as in the physiologic brain environment. Thus, the Og-NSC-derived mDA neurons exhibited improved synaptic maturity, functionality, resistance to toxic insults, and faithful expressions of the midbrain-specific factors, in vitro and in vivo long after transplantation. Consequently, Og-NSC transplantation yielded potent therapeutic outcomes that are reproducible in PD model animals. Collectively, our observations demonstrate that the organoid-based method may satisfy the demands needed in the clinical setting of PD cell therapy.",In-vitro-study,8,0

We demonstrate that these organoids can recapitulate the 3D pathological hallmarks observed in patients with LRRK2-associated sporadic Parkinson's disease. Importantly, analysis of the protein-protein interaction network in mutant organoids revealed that TXNIP, a thiol-oxidoreductase, is functionally important in the development of LRRK2-associated Parkinson's disease in a 3D environment. These results provide proof of principle for the utility of 3D organoid-based modeling of sporadic Parkinson's disease in advancing therapeutic discovery.",In-vitro-study,8,0
2398,284,rayyan-1270414108,Cytotherapy,Fifty-Hertz electromagnetic fields facilitate the induction of rat bone mesenchymal stromal cells to differentiate into functional neurons,"BACKGROUND AIMS: Research results have shown that bone mesenchymal stromal cells (BMSC) can different into neural cells. Electromagnetic fields (EMF) play a role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation, but the mechanisms behind this are unknown. In the present study, we explored the efficacy of EMF on the induction of rat BMSC differentiation into neurons in vitro. METHODS: First, rat BMSC were induced in a nerve cell culture environment and divided into three groups: an EMF induction treatment group (frequency of 50 Hz, magnetic induction of 5 mT, 60 min per day for 12 days), an induction-only group and a control group. Second, we observed cell phenotypes in a confocal microscope, tested gene expression through the use of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, and detected postsynaptic currents by means of a cell patch-clamp. We analyzed the cell cycles and the portion of cells expressing neural cell markers with the use of flow cytometry. RESULTS: The results indicated that EMF can facilitate BMSC differentiation into neural cells, which expressed neuronal-specific markers and genes; they formed synaptic junctions and pulsed excitatory postsynaptic currents. At the same time, the G0-G1 phase ratio recorded by means of flow cytometry gradually decreased under the EMF treatment, whereas there was an increase of S-phase ratio, and the portion of cells expressing neuronal-specific markers increased. CONCLUSIONS: Given that a noninvasive treatment of 50-Hz EMF could significantly facilitate BMSC to differentiate into functional neurons, EMF appears to be a promising clinical option for stem cell transplantation therapies to combat central nervous system diseases.",In-vitro-study,8,0

OBJECTIVE: This study was therefore designed to compare the efficacy and tolerability of switching from OLZ to ZIP, the combination of both medications, and OLZ and ZIP monotherapy, in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD). METHODS: In this 12 week open-label, assessor-blinded randomized trial, 148 patients with SSD who had not used antipsychotics for at least 3 months were assigned to ZIP (n = 49) or OLZ monotherapy (n = 31); OLZ for 4 weeks then a switch to ZIP (OLZ/ZIP, n = 35); or combination therapy (OLZ + ZIP, n = 33). The severity of psychosis and abnormal involuntary movements was evaluated at baseline, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks using standard instruments. Baseline-to-endpoint changes in weight gain and metabolic measures were compared. RESULTS: The efficacy of both OLZ/ZIP and OLZ + ZIP was comparable OLZ monotherapy and better than ZIP monotherapy in reducing overall psychotic and negative symptoms at most 8 and 12 week measurement points. Changes in weight gain, glucose, and lipid measures did not differ between OLZ/ZIP and OLZ + ZIP, but were markedly higher following OLZ monotherapy. The OLZ + ZIP group had the lowest overall incidence of adverse events and extrapyramidal symptoms of all the treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that combining ZIP and OLZ at the outset of treatment is superior to switching from OLZ to ZIP in terms of improving psychotic symptoms and limiting movement side effects without increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Patients (45-90 years of age) were randomized to placebo (n = 235), low-dose rivastigmine (1-4 mg/day, n = 233), or high-dose rivastigmine (6-12 mg/day, n = 231) for 26 weeks. Efficacy measures included the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog), the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change (CIBIC-Plus), the Progressive Deterioration Scale (PDS), the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS), and the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). For efficacy and safety analysis, patients were categorized by baseline Modified Hachinski Ischemic Score (MHIS) for the determination of VRF (MHIS > 0: presence of VRF; MHIS = 0: absence of VRF). As early as 12 weeks, the mean change from the baseline ADAS-Cog score was significantly different for those patients treated with high-dose rivastigmine compared with placebo controls in both MHIS categories. However, the treatment difference between high-dose rivastigmine and placebo at each time-point was larger for patients with MHIS > 0. The proportion of responders was significantly greater in the high-dose rivastigmine group for each level of improvement. No differences were noted between treatment groups regarding safety evaluations. Rivastigmine is effective in both categories of patients, and those with VRF experience greater clinical benefit (cognition, activities of daily living, and disease severity).",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

This randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial used these drugs to treat patients with probable, late onset Alzheimer's dementia (AD) (DSM V and NINCDS-ADRDA criteria) exhibiting insomnia (DSM V criteria and nocturnal NPI scores ≥ 2). Actigraphic records were performed for 7 days at baseline and for 14 days during the treatment period in 62 patients aged 80.5 years in average and randomized at a 1:1:1 ratio for administration of zolpidem 10 mg/day, zopiclone 7.5 mg/day or placebo. Primary endpoint was the main nocturnal sleep duration (MNSD), whereas secondary outcomes were the proportion of the night time slept, awake time after sleep onset (WASO), nocturnal awakenings, total daytime sleep time and daytime naps. Cognitive and functional domains were tested before and after drug/placebo use. Three participants under zopiclone use had intervention interrupted due to intense daytime sedation and worsened agitation with wandering. Zopiclone produced an 81 min increase in MNSD (95% confidence interval (CI): -0.8, 163.2), a 26 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -56.2, 4.8) and a 2-episode decrease in awakening per night (95% CI: -4.0, 0.4) in average compared to placebo. Zolpidem yielded no significant difference in MNSD despite a significant 22 min reduction in WASO (95% CI: -52.5, 8.3) and a reduction of 1 awakening each night (95% CI: -3.4, 1.2) in relation to placebo. There was a 1-point reduction in mean performance in the symbols search test among zolpidem users (95% CI: -4.1, 1.5) and an almost eight-point reduction in average scores in the digit-symbol coding test among zopiclone users (95% CI: -21.7, 6.2). In summary, short-term use of zolpidem or zopiclone by older insomniacs with AD appears to be clinically helpful, even though safety and tolerance remain issues to be personalized in healthcare settings and further investigated in subsequent trials.

METHODS: A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study involved 100 consecutive patients under 71 years old admitted to hospital for an acute ischaemic stroke; they were enrolled to receive 60 mg/day mianserin or placebo for 1 year. They were examined on admission, and at 2, 6, 12, and 18 months with depression, stroke, and functional outcome scales. RESULTS: According to DSM-III-R, the prevalence of major depression was 6% at the initial stage, 11% at 1 year, and 16% at 18 months. At no time point did prevalences differ between the treatment groups, nor were differences found in depression scales, although at 2 months a greater improvement from initial assessment on the Hamilton depression scale was evident in patients on mianserin (p=0.05). Some beneficial changes on the Hamilton depression scale and Beck depression inventory were found in patients older than 56 (median age) and in men treated with mianserin, but not in other subgroups. Mianserin treatment did not affect stroke outcome as measured by neurological status, nor did it have any influence on functional outcome as measured by Rankin scale or Barthel index. CONCLUSION: It was not possible to show that early initiation of antidepressant therapy can prevent poststroke depression, because the prevalence of poststroke depression remained low even in patients on placebo. In this stroke population with a low rate of depressive patients, antidepressive medical treatment failed to affect stroke outcome.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

OBJECTIVES: The present report summarises the basis for selection of 16 mg/day as monotherapy as the optimal treatment regime and the design rationale of a confirmatory Phase 3 trial (LUCIDITY). DESIGN: The trial comprises a 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled phase followed by a 12-month modified delayed-start open-label treatment phase. SETTING: 76 clinical research sites in North America and Europe. PARTICIPANTS: 545 patients with probable AD or MCI-AD in the final version of the protocol. INTERVENTION: Participants were assigned randomly to receive hydromethylthione mesylate at doses of 16 mg/day, 8 mg/day or placebo at a 4:1:4 ratio during the double-blind phase. All participants in the open-label phase receive the 16 mg/day dose. MEASUREMENTS: Co-primary clinical outcomes are the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog11) and the 23-item Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL23). Secondary biomarker measures include whole-brain atrophy and temporal lobe 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography. RESULTS: 446 participants are expected to complete the 12-month placebo-controlled phase in March 2022. CONCLUSIONS: If the primary end points are met, the data will provide confirmatory evidence of the clinical and biomarker benefits of hydromethylthionine mesylate in minimal to moderate AD. As low-dose oral hydromethylthionine mesylate is simple to use clinically, does not cause amyloid-related imaging abnormalities and has a benign safety profile, it would likely improve AD management.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Results of repeated measures analyses of variance showed superiority of active drug over placebo by the end of the first week, and this improvement increased in significance at each successive visit. Improvement on tranylcypromine after week 1 was greater than that on placebo after week 6. Analysis of covariance of week 6 scores (corrected for week 0 scores) showed significantly greater improvement for tranylcypromine patients on all measures of depressive symptomatology. Tranylcypromine is a rapid, relatively safe, and dramatically effective treatment for anergic depression. Since 24 of 29 of the bipolar subjects had previously failed to respond to tricyclics and since bipolar depression is usually anergic, tranylcypromine should be compared to imipramine to determine the antidepressant of choice for manic-depressive illness.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

We aimed to investigate whether there was any evidence for the benefits of rivastigmine in patients with severe disease. These patients were compared with matched controls. In this study, 24 patients with advanced moderate AD received rivastigmine for 12 months. Another 20 patients received placebo. Mean daily doses of rivastigmine in the higher-dose group at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months were 6.1 +/- 1.0, 8.3 +/- 1.2, 8.9 +/- 1.3, and 10.7 +/- 1.6 mg/day, respectively. Cognitive abilities were assessed using the 11-item cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-cog). Forty-five percent of placebo-treated patients declined by at least 4 points on the ADAS-cog. Conversely, only 18.3% of patients treated with rivastigmine declined by 4 or more points. Functional disabilities, as assessed using the Disability Assessment for Dementia Scale, remained significantly superior in rivastigmine-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. Patients benefited from high-dose rivastigmine treatment on all outcome measures, including the Mini-Mental State Examination, Progressive Deterioration Scale, as well as the Global Deterioration Scale. Patients receiving rivastigmine for 12 months significantly improved compared with placebo-treated patients (p < 0.001). By 52 weeks, patients originally treated with 6-12 mg/day rivastigmine had a significantly better cognitive function than patients originally treated with placebo. Long-term rivastigmine treatment appeared to be well tolerated in patients with advanced moderate AD and significantly benefits the cognitive and functional symptoms of AD.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

Treatment of vascular dementia is currently based on the recognition and control of vascular risk factors, while specific drugs have not been approved yet. The aim of the present multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nimodipine administered for as long as 26 weeks in improving cognition or slowing cognitive deterioration in patients defined as having multi-infarct dementia (DSM-III-R criteria). Two hundred and fifty-nine patients were included (128 nimodipine, 131 placebo), and 251 were available for the intention-to-treat analysis. No significant difference between drug-treated and placebo patients was noted on the Gottfries-Brâne-Steen scale score (primary efficacy criterion), the remaining neuropsychological tests (Zahlen-Verbindungs-Test, Fuld-Object-Memory Evaluation, Word Fluency Test, Digit Span, Mini-Mental State Examination), and the functional scales (index of Activity of Daily Living, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living, Rapid Disability Scale, Clinical Dementia Rating), although the majority of changes were in favor of the active drug group. A lower incidence of cerebrovascular and cardiac events was observed in the nimodipine-treated patients in comparison with the placebo group. This study failed to show a significant effect of nimodipine on cognitive, social or global assessments in patients defined as affected by multi-infarct dementia according to the DSM-III-R criteria. A post-hoc analysis (presented in an accompanying paper) suggests that nimodipine may have a favorable effect in the subgroup of patients defined as affected by subcortical (small vessel) vascular dementia.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

METHODS: This was a randomized, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of outpatients (N = 130) meeting DSM-IIIR criteria for cocaine dependence and major depression or dysthymia (by SCID interview). Participants were treated with venlafaxine, up to 300 mg/day versus placebo. All patients received weekly individual manual-guided relapse prevention therapy. Weekly outcome measures included Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), self-reported cocaine use, urine toxicology and the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D). RESULTS: Mood response, defined as a 50% reduction in the Ham-D between randomization and end of study, was 41% (26/64) on venlafaxine, and 33% (22/66) on placebo (p = .39). Measures of depression (Ham-D and CGI) improved more rapidly on venlafaxine than placebo, but these differences disappeared by weeks 6-8. Cocaine outcomes did not differ between treatment groups, and the proportion of patients achieving three or more consecutive weeks of urine-confirmed abstinence was low (venlafaxine: 16%; placebo: 15%). Reduction in cocaine use was associated with mood response. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, venlafaxine was not superior to placebo on either mood or cocaine use outcomes. Mood improvement was associated with improvement in cocaine use. However, placebo mood response was only moderate, and the proportion of patients achieving sustained abstinence was low. This suggests that the subgroup of cocaine-dependent patients with depressive disorders is relatively treatment resistant, and that further research is needed to improve outcomes for these patients.",Human-RCT-drug-intervention,11,0

As risk factors for eating disorders are partly associated with overweight and overweight in turn is correlated to disordered eating, this study will offer a combined eating disorder prevention program which also promotes a balanced lifestyle to normal weight and overweight individuals alike. The efficacy of the program has been proven in previous trials. The study aims to evaluate the dissemination of a combined eating disorder prevention and health promotion program (everyBody) to women of all age groups and varying levels of ED risk status in the general population. METHODS: A dissemination trial will be conducted in German-speaking countries, including 4160 women from the general population. Participants will be screened to exclude participants who are likely to have an ED. Eligible participants will be allocated to one of five program arms based on their BMI and respective ED symptoms. The guided program consists of 4 to 12 weeks of weekly sessions offering CBT-based exercises, psychoeducational material, self-monitoring, and group discussions. Outcomes will be assessed according to the RE-AIM model, including measures of effectiveness, reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the program. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSIONS: This trial aims to disseminate a combined ED prevention and health promotion program in the general population, offering universal, selective and indicated prevention in one program. To our knowledge, it is the first trial to systematically evaluate dissemination efforts based on the RE-AIM model.

The aim of the study is to outline the study protocol of a trial to test the efficacy of a mobile coach based intervention for the prevention of childhood drowning. METHOD/DESIGN: A two-arm cluster randomized community trial will be conducted to test the efficacy of the mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning on parents with children below five years of age and compared to an assessment only control group. A total of 1680 parents in the villages with children aged below five years of age will participate. The village will be used as a randomized unit, randomly assigned to an intervention group (N = 840) receiving the mobile coach based intervention or an assessment only control group (N = 840). An individualized mobile coach intervention based on the demographic data and the individual will be developed, and SMSs, audio messages, videos and images about childhood drowning will be sent to the participants of the intervention group over a period of six months. The participants will receive per week one text message (SMS) and image and one video and audio text per month. The primary outcome measure will be increased knowledge and safety awareness, and behaviour practice about childhood drowning assessed at the six-month follow-up, and the secondary outcome measure will be the reduced incidence of childhood drowning in Bangladesh. The study assistants conducting the baseline and the follow-up assessments will be blinded regarding the group assignment. DISCUSSION: This is the first study testing a fully mobile coach intervention for childhood drowning prevention in Bangladesh. It is hoped that the programme will offer an effective and inexpensive way to prevent childhood drowning among children aged below five years and also increase the awareness of parents concerning the risks to their children from drowning.

2624,510,rayyan-1270389354,Trials,Cornerstone program for transition-age youth with serious mental illness: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: Transition-age youth have elevated rates of mental disorders, and they often do not receive services. This is a serious public health concern, as mental health conditions persist into adulthood. Continuing to engage this population has been a pervasive challenge for the mental health care system worldwide. Few mental health interventions have been developed for transition-age youth, and even fewer have been found to be effective over the transition to adulthood. Cornerstone, a theoretically guided intervention has shown promise for addressing the mental health and psychosocial needs of this population as they emerge into adulthood. Cornerstone provides case management, trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy, mentoring/peer support, community-based in vivo practice, and groups to address stigma, mistrust, and practical skill development to improve the transition to independence among transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions. METHODS/DESIGN: This study utilizes a hybrid research design and focuses on examining feasibility, acceptability and preliminary impact, along with factors that influence implementation, to maximize new knowledge. The study combines qualitative methods and a randomized controlled trial, using data to inform and refine protocols and manuals, while testing the preliminary impact of the intervention, compared to best available services (treatment as usual, TAU) at a partnering outpatient mental health clinic (n = 60). Contributors to the intervention development research (n = 20) are national experts on mental health services, clinic administrators and staff and young adults with direct experience. The intervention involves intensive staff training and 18 months of ongoing service provision, monitoring and supervision. Quantitative survey data will be collected at baseline, 3 months, 6 months, and 9 months measuring mental health and practical life outcomes via self-report measures. Medical records will be used to triangulate self-report data (i.e., primary diagnosis, treatment planning and attendance). Qualitative data focuses on the intervention development process and implementation research and will use constant comparison coding techniques. In this intention-to-treat analysis, we will conduct basic omnibus analyses to examine whether Cornerstone leads to improved outcomes relative to TAU utilizing t tests across treatment conditions for each outcome measure specified. We will likewise examine whether changes in the proposed mediating variables differ across groups. DISCUSSION: The aim of this study is to refine Cornerstone through an intensive preliminary trial, learning through collaboration with clinic staff, project team members, and leaders in New York State and nationwide on how to best serve transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions. Cornerstone has the potential to fill a large gap in the service system for transition-age youth with serious mental health conditions, and may enhance the menu of care options for those who have been recently diagnosed with a serious mental health condition, and yet, have a long life to live. The program is recovery-oriented, builds on the best evidence to date, and is in line with both local and national health care reform efforts.

2626,512,rayyan-1270393277,Trials,The efficacy of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) for young individuals with high-level perceived stress: study protocol for a randomized sham-controlled trial,"BACKGROUND: High level of perceived stress may result in negative effects both psychologically and physically on individuals and may predispose onset of mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder. However, there is no suitable intervention for it. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) studies have shown its therapeutic efficacy in treatment resistant patients with stress-related disorders. Here we describe an exploratory study protocol to investigate the effect of the intervention for the individuals with high level of stress. METHOD: This is a single blinded, randomized sham-controlled trial, targeting at young healthy adults aging from 18 to 24 years old. Forty eligible volunteers will be recruited and randomly divided into active and sham rTMS group. All subjects will take a set of neuropsychological and biological assessments and MRI scanning before and right after the intervention. During the interventional period, 12-session stimulations will be performed in 4 weeks with three sessions per week. The primary outcome will detect the difference of Chinese 14-item perceived stress scales between active and sham rTMS groups after intervention. Secondary outcomes will examine the differences of other affective measurements, level of cortisol, and MRI-derived neural functional measures between the two groups after intervention. DISCUSSION: This trial aims to examine the effect of the 12-session rTMS intervention on individuals with high level of perceived stress. Positive or negative findings from any of the outcome measures would further our understanding of the efficacy of the stimulation and its neural impact. If effective, it would provide an evidence for a new treatment for high perceived stress. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR1900027662 ). Registered on 23 November 2019.

In community-based samples, 2-4% of women and 1-3% men are diagnosed with BED. Psychotherapeutic interventions focusing on maintenance factors of disturbed eating behavior have proven to be effective. However, treatment access is limited for a considerable number of patients with BED. A lack of specialized institutions and treatment resources, but also long distances to treatment facilities for people living in remote or rural areas are often causes of insufficient care. Internet-based guided self-help (GSH) programs have the potential to fill this gap. METHODS: This project aims to develop and evaluate an Internet-based treatment for BED derived from an evidence-based manualized cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). The primary goal is to test feasibility and suitability of the Internet-based program and to evaluate the treatment outcome in comparison to a pure and a placebo-inspired waitlist control group (i.e. reduction of binge-eating episodes and eating disorder pathology as primary outcome variables). In total, 60 women and men aged 18-70 years with a BED diagnosis will be recruited. The Internet-based GSH treatment comprises eight sessions followed by three booster sessions. The placebo-inspired waitlist control group receives weekly messages containing information increasing positive expectations regarding the treatment effects during the four-week waiting period. The pure waitlist control group receives weekly messages simply asking patients to fill in a short questionnaire. DISCUSSION: The access to evidence-based treatments for BED might be made easier using an Internet-based GSH approach. The present study protocol presents a randomized controlled trial. As well as evaluating the suitability and efficacy of the Internet-based GSH treatment, there will also be a prelimarily investigation on the influence of positive expectations (placebo) for a therapeutic intervention on core symptoms.

2628,514,rayyan-1270387305,BMC Geriatr,A water-based training program that include perturbation exercises to improve stepping responses in older adults: study protocol for a randomized controlled cross-over trial,"BACKGROUND: Gait and balance impairments may increase the risk of falls, the leading cause of accidental death in the elderly population. Fall-related injuries constitute a serious public health problem associated with high costs for society as well as human suffering. A rapid step is the most important protective postural strategy, acting to recover equilibrium and prevent a fall from initiating. It can arise from large perturbations, but also frequently as a consequence of volitional movements. We propose to use a novel water-based training program which includes specific perturbation exercises that will target the stepping responses that could potentially have a profound effect in reducing risk of falling. We describe the water-based balance training program and a study protocol to evaluate its efficacy (Trial registration number #NCT00708136). METHODS/DESIGN: The proposed water-based training program involves use of unpredictable, multi-directional perturbations in a group setting to evoke compensatory and volitional stepping responses. Perturbations are made by pushing slightly the subjects and by water turbulence, in 24 training sessions conducted over 12 weeks. Concurrent cognitive tasks during movement tasks are included. Principles of physical training and exercise including awareness, continuity, motivation, overload, periodicity, progression and specificity were used in the development of this novel program. Specific goals are to increase the speed of stepping responses and improve the postural control mechanism and physical functioning. A prospective, randomized, cross-over trial with concealed allocation, assessor blinding and intention-to-treat analysis will be performed to evaluate the efficacy of the water-based training program. A total of 36 community-dwelling adults (age 65-88) with no recent history of instability or falling will be assigned to either the perturbation-based training or a control group (no training). Voluntary step reaction times and postural stability using stabiliogram diffusion analysis will be tested before and after the 12 weeks of training. DISCUSSION: This study will determine whether a water-based balance training program that includes perturbation exercises, in a group setting, can improve speed of voluntary stepping responses and improve balance control. Results will help guide the development of more cost-effective interventions that can prevent the occurrence of falls in the elderly.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
2629,515,rayyan-1270388864,BMC Psychiatry,Narrative exposure therapy for immigrant children traumatized by war: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of effectiveness and mechanisms of change,"BACKGROUND: Millions of children worldwide suffer from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and other mental health problems due to repeated exposure to war or organized violence. Forms of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) are the most commonly used treatment for PTSD and appear to be effective for children as well, but little is known about the mechanisms of change through which they achieve their effectiveness. Here we present the study protocol of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) studying the effectiveness and mechanisms of change of Narrative Exposure Therapy (NET), a CBT-based, manualized, short-term intervention for PTSD symptoms resulting from repeated traumatization, in immigrant children traumatized by war. METHODS/DESIGN: We are conducting a multicentre, pragmatic RCT in a usual care setting. Up to 80 9-17-year-old immigrant children who have experienced war and suffer from PTSD symptoms will be randomized into intervention (NET) and control (treatment as usual, TAU) groups of equal sizes. The effectiveness of NET treatment will be compared to both a waiting list and the parallel TAU positive control group, on the primary outcomes of PTSD and depressive symptoms, psychological distress, resilience, and level of cognitive performance. The effects of the intervention on traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions will be studied as potential mechanisms of change mediating overall treatment effectiveness. The possible moderating effects of peritraumatic dissociation, level of cognitive performance, and gender on treatment effectiveness will also be considered. We hypothesize that NET will be more effective than a waitlist condition or TAU in reducing PTSD and other symptoms and improving resilience, and that these effects will be mediated by changes in traumatic memories and posttraumatic cognitions. DISCUSSION: The results of this trial will provide evidence for the effectiveness of NET in treating trauma-related symptoms in immigrant children affected by war. The trial will also generate insights into the complex relationships between PTSD, memory functions, posttraumatic cognitions and cognitive performance in children, and help guide the future development and implementation of therapeutic interventions for PTSD in children.

Fragmentation of care, inadequate pain communication, and reluctance towards pain medication contribute to difficulties in optimizing outcomes. Integration of patient self-management and professional care by means of healthcare technology provides new opportunities in the outpatient setting. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol outlines a two-armed multicenter randomized controlled trial that compares a technology based multicomponent self-management support intervention with care as usual and includes an effect, economic and process evaluation. Patients will be recruited consecutively via the outpatient oncology clinics and inpatient oncology wards of one academic hospital and one regional hospital in the south of the Netherlands. Irrespective of the stage of disease, patients are eligible when they are diagnosed with cancer and have uncontrolled moderate to severe cancer (treatment) related pain defined as NRS≥4 for more than two weeks. Randomization (1:1) will assign patients to either the intervention or control group; patients in the intervention group receive self-management support and patients in the control group receive care as usual. The intervention will be delivered by registered nurses specialized in pain and palliative care. Important components include monitoring of pain, adverse effects and medication as well as graphical feedback, education, and nurse support. Effect measurements for both groups will be carried out with questionnaires at baseline (T0), after 4 weeks (T1) and after 12 weeks (T2). Pain intensity and quality of life are the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes include self-efficacy, knowledge, anxiety, depression and pain medication use. The final questionnaire contains also questions for the economic evaluation that includes both cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analysis. Data for the process evaluation will be gathered continuously over the study period and focus on recruitment, reach, dose delivered and dose received. DISCUSSION: The proposed study will provide insight into the effectiveness of the self-management support intervention delivered by nurses to outpatients with uncontrolled cancer pain. Study findings will be used to empower patients and health professionals to improve cancer pain control. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02333968 December 29, 2014.",Clinical-study-protocol,12,0
2631,517,rayyan-1270388816,BMC Complement Altern Med,A randomised controlled trial: can acupuncture reduce drug requirement during analgosedation with propofol and alfentanil for colonoscopy? A study protocol,"BACKGROUND: The number of colonoscopies tremendously increased in recent years and will further rise in the near future. Because of patients' growing expectation on comfort during medical procedures, it is not surprising that the demand for sedation also expands. Propofol in combination with alfentanil is known to provide excellent analgosedation, however, its use is associated with respiratory and cardiovascular depression. Acupuncture could be a technique to reduce drug requirement while providing the same level of sedation and analgesia. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be performed as a single centre, randomised, placebo controlled trial. 153 patients scheduled for propofol/alfentanil sedation during colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive electroacupuncture (P6, ST36, LI4), sham acupuncture, or placebo acupuncture. Following endoscopy patients and gastroenterologists have to fill in questionnaires about their sedation experiences. Additionally, patients have to accomplish the Trieger test before and after the procedure. Patient monitoring includes time adapted HR, SpO2, ECG, NIBP, exCO2, OAA/S, and the Aldrete score. The primary outcome parameter is the dosage of propofol necessary for an adequate level of sedation to tolerate the procedure (OAA/S < 4). Effectiveness of sedation, classified by satisfaction levels measured by questionnaires is the secondary outcome parameter. DISCUSSION: Moderate to deep sedation using propofol is increasingly applied during colonoscopies with a high satisfaction level among patients despite well-known hemodynamic and respiratory side effects of this hypnotic agent. Acupuncture is known to attenuate gastrointestinal discomfort and pain. We hypothesize that the combination of conventional sedation techniques with acupuncture may result in equally satisfied patients with a lower risk of respiratory and hemodynamic events during colonoscopies.

Its chronic course is associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, a high risk of suicide and poor social and occupational outcomes. Despite the great advances over the last decades in understanding mental disorders, the mechanisms underlying bipolar disorder at the neural network level still remain elusive. This has severe consequences for clinical practice, for instance by inadequate diagnoses or delayed treatments. The German research consortium BipoLife aims to shed light on the mechanisms underlying bipolar disorders. It was established in 2015 and incorporates ten university hospitals across Germany. Its research projects focus in particular on individuals at high risk of bipolar disorder, young patients in the early stages of the disease and patients with an unstable highly relapsing course and/or with acute suicidal ideation. METHODS: Functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was acquired across nine sites within three different studies. Obtaining neuroimaging data in a multicenter setting requires among others the harmonization of the acquisition protocol, the standardization of paradigms and the implementation of regular quality control procedures. The present article outlines the MRI imaging protocols, the acquisition parameters, the imaging paradigms, the neuroimaging quality assessment procedures and the number of recruited subjects. DISCUSSION: The careful implementation of a MRI study protocol as well as the adherence to well-defined quality assessment procedures is one key benchmark in the evaluation of the overall quality of large-scale multicenter imaging studies.

However, this technique is currently not widely reimbursed because of the lack of appropriately designed studies demonstrating its clinical effect. OBJECTIVE: To assess the clinical effect of amyloid PET in memory clinic patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The AMYPAD-DPMS is a prospective randomized clinical trial in 8 European memory clinics. Participants were allocated (using a minimization method) to 3 study groups based on the performance of amyloid PET: arm 1, early in the diagnostic workup (within 1 month); arm 2, late in the diagnostic workup (after a mean [SD] 8 [2] months); or arm 3, if and when the managing physician chose. Participants were patients with subjective cognitive decline plus (SCD+; SCD plus clinical features increasing the likelihood of preclinical Alzheimer disease), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia; they were assessed at baseline and after 3 months. Recruitment took place between April 16, 2018, and October 30, 2020. Data analysis was performed from July 2022 to January 2023. INTERVENTION: Amyloid PET. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: The main outcome was the difference between arm 1 and arm 2 in the proportion of participants receiving an etiological diagnosis with a very high confidence (ie, ≥90% on a 50%-100% visual numeric scale) after 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 844 participants were screened, and 840 were enrolled (291 in arm 1, 271 in arm 2, 278 in arm 3). Baseline and 3-month visit data were available for 272 participants in arm 1 and 260 in arm 2 (median [IQR] age: 71 [65-77] and 71 [65-77] years; 150/272 male [55%] and 135/260 male [52%]; 122/272 female [45%] and 125/260 female [48%]; median [IQR] education: 12 [10-15] and 13 [10-16] years, respectively). After 3 months, 109 of 272 participants (40%) in arm 1 had a diagnosis with very high confidence vs 30 of 260 (11%) in arm 2 (P < .001). This was consistent across cognitive stages (SCD+: 25/84 [30%] vs 5/78 [6%]; P < .001; MCI: 45/108 [42%] vs 9/102 [9%]; P < .001; dementia: 39/80 [49%] vs 16/80 [20%]; P < .001). CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: In this study, early amyloid PET allowed memory clinic patients to receive an etiological diagnosis with very high confidence after only 3 months compared with patients who had not undergone amyloid PET. These findings support the implementation of amyloid PET early in the diagnostic workup of memory clinic patients. TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT Number: 2017-002527-21.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
2640,526,rayyan-1277757078,Neurology,Evolution of clinical features in possible DLB depending on FP-CIT SPECT result,"OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that core and suggestive features in possible dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) would vary in their ability to predict an abnormal dopamine transporter scan and therefore a follow-up diagnosis of probable DLB. A further objective was to assess the evolution of core and suggestive features in patients with possible DLB over time depending on the (123)I-FP-CIT SPECT scan result. METHODS: A total of 187 patients with possible DLB (dementia plus one core or one suggestive feature) were randomized to have dopamine transporter imaging or to follow-up without scan. DLB features were compared at baseline and at 6-month follow-up according to imaging results and follow-up diagnosis. RESULTS: For the whole cohort, the baseline frequency of parkinsonism was 30%, fluctuations 29%, visual hallucinations 24%, and REM sleep behavior disorder 17%. Clinician-rated presence of parkinsonism at baseline was significantly (p = 0.001) more frequent and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score at baseline was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in patients with abnormal imaging. There was a significant increase in UPDRS score in the abnormal scan group over time (p < 0.01). There was relatively little evolution of the rest of the DLB features regardless of the imaging result. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with possible DLB, apart from UPDRS score, there was no difference in the evolution of DLB clinical features over 6 months between cases with normal and abnormal imaging. Only parkinsonism and dopamine transporter imaging helped to differentiate DLB from non-DLB dementia.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

There was weak evidence that intensive case management more effective in reducing the duration of care in those with personality disorder than in those without personality disorder.,Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0

This quasi-experimental study examined the experience of using a psychosocial assessment instrument to understand caregiver needs delivered in an interview versus a self-administered web-based format. METHODS: Ten family caregivers were randomized to an interview group or a web-based group with two advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs). Surveys captured the caregivers' and APRNs' assessment experiences. FINDINGS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two caregiver groups. Both groups rated the assessment instrument as excellent or good, finding it easy to complete capturing real needs they frequently denied or ignored. The APRN reported the web-based format was easier to use. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Healthcare providers could use web-based caregiver assessment as an effective, efficient method for identifying care needs and planning interventions that promote balance/congruence in caregivers' lives.",Human-RCT-non-intervention,13,0
